SUMMARY OF SUBJECT MATTER

TO:      LMembers, Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime
Transportation
FROM:  LStaff, Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime
Transportation
RE:      LSubcommittee Hearing on ``Guardians of the Sea:
Examining Coast Guard Efforts in Drug Enforcement, Illegal
Migration, and IUU Fishing''
_______________________________________________________________________

I. PURPOSE

The Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation
will meet on November 14, 2023, at 10:00 a.m. ET in 2167 of the
Rayburn House Office Building to receive testimony at a hearing
entitled ``Guardians of the Sea: Examining Coast Guard Efforts
in Drug Enforcement, Illegal Migration, and IUU Fishing.''
Members will examine the United States Coast Guard's (Coast
Guard) law enforcement missions. The hearing will focus on the
Coast Guard's efforts to interdict the illegal entry of drugs
and migrants along the maritime border and deter illegal,
unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing. At the hearing,
Members will receive testimony from the Coast Guard, the
Government Accountability Office, the RAND Corporation, and the
Congressional Research Service.

II. BACKGROUND

The Coast Guard is uniquely positioned as the only military
service capable of performing maritime law enforcement
operations. Under its authorities, the Coast Guard is actively
engaged in missions pertaining to drug interdiction, migrant
interdiction, and the protection of natural resources from
malign activity, like IUU fishing.\1\ It performs these mission
sets within the territorial waters and exclusive economic zone
of the United States, on the high seas, and in foreign
territorial waters when operating under agreements with allies
and partner nations.\2\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
From 2018 to 2022, the Coast Guard intercepted and seized
888 metric tons of cocaine, worth approximately $25.76
billion.\3\ The Service also detained 2,776 drug smugglers for
prosecution.\4\ More recently, the Coast Guard seized 11,600
pounds of cocaine valued at $158 million in July 2023 and
12,100 pounds of cocaine valued at $160 million in September
2023.\5\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition to drug seizures, one of the Coast Guard's most
important roles in defending the homeland is countering illegal
maritime migrations. A significant problem area for illegal
maritime migration is the Caribbean. During fiscal year (FY)
2022, the Coast Guard interdicted 12,000 Haitian and Cuban
migrants alone.\6\ This number is expected to grow in FY 2023
as the Coast Guard continues to surge assets to the Caribbean
in response.

operations-are-state-emergency [hereinafter Feltovic].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Finally, the Coast Guard's ability to interdict bad actors
and enforce local and international laws has made it an
important tool in countering Chinese malign and grey-zone
activity in the Indo-Pacific, such as IUU fishing. The Coast
Guard is the only agency explicitly referenced by name in the
2022 Indo-Pacific Strategy, cementing the importance of Coast
Guard abilities and authorities in supporting United States
National security interests.\7\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

III. DRUG/MIGRANT INTERDICTION

The Coast Guard is the lead and only Federal maritime law
enforcement agency with the authority and capability to enforce
National and international law on the high seas, including for
both drug and migrant interdiction operations.\8\ The Coast
Guard is constrained in conducting these missions by limited
assets.\9\ Drug and migrant source countries are often hundreds
of miles away from United States coastlines, requiring
detection, monitoring, and efforts to occur across vast
expanses of time and distance. While the Coast Guard attempts
to use historic trends, intelligence, and advanced monitoring
technologies to maximize the deployment of its assets, it is
constantly forced to prioritize certain vectors and lapse
coverage for others.\10\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

DRUG INTERDICTION

Illicit maritime drug shipments are carried by
noncommercial means, such as small ``go-fast'' vessels with
multiple outboard engines, semisubmersible vessels, fishing
vessels, and sailing vessels, as well as by commercial vessels,
such as container ships.\11\ The majority of known maritime
drug flow is conveyed via noncommercial means through the
Western Hemisphere Transit Zone--the waters off the coasts of
Central and South America and the Caribbean Sea.\12\ The Coast
Guard uses cutters, boats, aircraft, and unmanned monitoring
systems in a layered approach to combat drug cartels as they
transport illicit drugs in the maritime domain.\13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\11\ See United States Coast Guard Report to Congress: Counter-Drug
Operations, (2020), https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/

Drug Operations].
\12\ Id.
\13\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The objectives of Coast Guard drug interdiction efforts are
to: (1) maintain a strong interdiction presence to deny
smugglers access to maritime routes and deter trafficking
activity; (2) strengthen ties with source and Transit Zone
(Eastern Pacific and Caribbean) Nations to increase their
willingness and ability to reduce the production and
trafficking of illicit drugs within their sovereign boundaries,
including territorial seas; and (3) support interagency and
international efforts to combat drug smuggling through
increased cooperation and coordination.\14\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\14\ See United States Coast Guard Report to Congress: Coast Guard
Interdiction of Illicit Drugs in Transit Zones, (2022), (on file with
Comm.) [hereinafter Transit Zones].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Coast Guard facilitates international maritime
counternarcotics operations with partner nations that permit
Coast Guard officers to stop, board, and search suspicious
vessels.\15\ The United States government is party to 41
maritime counterdrug bilateral agreements or operational
procedures to coordinate detection, monitoring, interdiction,
and apprehension activities.\16\ The Coast Guard's law
enforcement, legal, and regulatory expertise are in high demand
from Central American partners, whose navies more closely
resemble the Coast Guard, focusing primarily on maritime law
enforcement.\17\ Coast Guard personnel act as attaches,
liaisons, maritime advisors, and drug interdiction specialists
at embassies around the world.\18\ International training teams
and deployed units provide training, engage in joint
operations, and may even embark ship riders to facilitate
enforcement.\19\

Annually, the Coast Guard removes approximately ten percent
of the cocaine flowing through maritime transit routes while
indications show the majority of the remaining 90 percent is
typically not intercepted before reaching the shore.\20\ Drug
interdictions are prosecuted through multi-agency and multi-
national coordination. United States Southern Command, through
the Joint Interagency Task Force-South (JIATF-S), is
responsible for cueing and detections, while the Coast Guard is
the primary force provider of surface assets used as law
enforcement platforms and presence.\21\ The Maritime Drug Law
Enforcement Act, 46 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 70501-70507, and the Drug
Trafficking Vessel Interdiction Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec.  2285, are
the primary criminal statutes utilized in the counter-drug
mission.\22\ These laws apply extraterritorially so that
persons who are interdicted aboard suspected drug smuggling
vessels in international waters may be prosecuted in the United
States.\23\

By leveraging its unique authorities and collaborating
across United States agencies and with international partners,
the Coast Guard prevents more cocaine from entering the United
States than all other Federal agencies combined.\24\

\24\ See Transit Zones, supra note 14.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ILLEGAL MIGRATION

In 2022, the Coast Guard saw one of the deadliest years for
illegal migration in recent history when approximately 65
people perished while trying to reach the United States.\25\ In
2023, illegal maritime migration, and consequently Coast Guard
interdictions, continue to reach increasingly high levels due
to major economic and social turmoil unfolding in the Caribbean
and South American countries.\26\ Overall, most maritime
migration is illegal and can occur along hundreds of miles of
coastline, which is impossible to continuously patrol. While
there are several prevailing vectors of unauthorized maritime
migration into the United States, maritime routes from Cuba,
Haiti, and the Dominican Republic on the east coast and Mexico
on the west coast have historically accounted for the highest
annual interdiction attempts.\27\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\25\ See Nicole J. Groll, Operation Vigilant Sentry: Stopping
Illegal Migration at Sea, (Jan. 27, 2023), available at https://

sentry-stopping-illegal-migration-at-sea/ [hereinafter Groll].
\26\ Feltovic, supra note 6.
\27\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Illegal maritime migration takes place over long expanses
of water and is slow and hazardous.\28\ Maritime migration
efforts are typically unorganized, utilizing homemade
``rustic'' vessels like makeshift rafts constructed with debris
and tarps, locally made sail freighters, or other modified
modes of transportation engineered to float.\29\ These vessels
are almost always severely overloaded with people. For example,
a 50-foot sail freighter may have more than 200 migrants
crammed onboard.\30\ The makeshift vessels are neither
seaworthy nor safe, often incapable of withstanding heavy seas
and sinking even in benign weather.\31\ For example, in 2004, a
group of Cuban Nationals tried to sail to the United States in
a 1959 Buick car fashioned into a boat when they were
intercepted at sea by the Coast Guard.\32\ They have little to
no navigation or lifesaving equipment.\33\ Accordingly, illegal
maritime migration has both law enforcement and humanitarian
assistance implications.

Individuals interdicted at sea are either repatriated to
their country of origin or departure or brought to the United
States to face prosecution.\34\ Many Coast Guard cutters
operating off the Florida coast and in the Caribbean end up
packed with migrants beyond their maximum capacity, because the
continual stream of migration offers little opportunity for a
Coast Guard cutter to leave the scene.\35\ Furthermore, Coast
Guard cutters are not equipped with spaces to house hundreds of
migrants for extended periods of time and have limited
personnel available to monitor them while onboard.\36\

DRUG/MIGRANT INTERDICTION

Undoubtedly, maritime drug trafficking and illegal
migration are on the rise.\37\ The challenges associated with
these Coast Guard missions are only increasing, due to limited
Coast Guard assets and capacity.\38\ Despite this, the Coast
Guard continues to be the Nation's primary maritime force to
combat transnational criminal organizations engaging in illicit
drug and migrant operations, secure maritime borders, and
safeguard commerce throughout the Western Hemisphere.\39\

IV. IUU FISHING

Illegal fishing encompasses fishing activities that
contradict state, Federal, and international laws and
regulations.\40\ Unreported fishing includes fishing activities
that are not reported or misrepresented in contravention of
relevant laws.\41\ Unregulated fishing refers to fishing
activity undertaken by flagless vessels, or that occurs in
areas outside of regulated fish stocks and outside of
applicable laws and regulations to conserve living marine
resources.\42\

\42\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Twenty percent of fish caught around the world originate
from IUU fishing, resulting in tens of billions of dollars in
lost revenue to legal fishers, and harming the management of
marine fish stocks.\43\ By virtue of its size, scale, and
range, China is the largest IUU offender.\44\ China accounts
for more than a third of the world's seafood production, and
Chinese vessels make up nearly 40 percent of the world's
distant-water fishing fleet.\45\ China's distant-water fishing
fleet is subsidized by the Chinese Government, with an
estimated $7.2 billion in subsidies going to the sector in
2018.\46\ Chinese vessels are responsible for numerous IUU
fishing violations, including fishing in other Nations'
exclusive economic zones and incorrectly reporting fishing
activity. Chinese vessels often operate in disputed territorial
waters with competition over fishery resources driving some of
the disputes.\47\

The Coast Guard monitors and works to mitigate illegal
fishing through domestic efforts like the United States
Interagency Working Group where the Coast Guard is one of 21
member agencies and international efforts working with partner
nations in the Indo-Pacific through coordination groups,
multinational enforcement operations, and bilateral
agreements.\48\ The United States Interagency Working Group was
established in the National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2020 (P.L. 116-92), which directed additional
efforts to combat IUU fishing, including coordination with
international organizations, diplomatic engagement, and support
to improve law enforcement capabilities in priority
regions.\49\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Earlier this year, the National Academy of Sciences
released an assessment on emerging issues that require Coast
Guard action. The report notes that as illegal fishing
increases, the Coast Guard will need to improve its data
collection, work with non-governmental organizations and deploy
assets to areas where they will be most effective.\50\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Over the next decade, the Coast Guard intends to focus its
IUU efforts in three areas. These include expanding and
strengthening bilateral and multilateral partnerships to
maximize IUU enforcement efforts, countering predatory and
irresponsible state behavior, including that of China, and
expanding targeted intelligence to drive enforcement
options.\51\

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL WEBSTER OF FLORIDA, CHAIRMAN,
SUBCOMMITTEE ON COAST GUARD AND MARITIME TRANSPORTATION

Mr. Webster of Florida. We meet today to examine the Coast
Guard's law enforcement missions, focusing on the Service's
counterdrug and migrant efforts and its work to limit illegal,
unreported, and unregulated, or IUU, fishing.
I would like to welcome our distinguished witnesses today.
Rear Admiral Jo-Ann Burdian--is that correct?
Admiral Burdian. Yes, sir.
Mr. Webster of Florida. OK. She is the Assistant Commandant
for Response Policy at the Coast Guard.
Heather MacLeod, Director of Homeland Security and Justice
at the Government Accountability Office.
Aaron Davenport, associate director of the Infrastructure,
Immigration, and Security Operations Program at the RAND
Corporation.
And Caitlin Keating-Bitonti, natural resources policy
analyst at the Congressional Research Service.
The Coast Guard is our Nation's premier maritime law
enforcement agency and is actively engaged in countering
illicit marine activity. This includes stopping the flow of
illegal drugs to our shores, interdicting illegal maritime
migration, and protecting the environment through efforts to
curb illegal fishing. Illicit maritime activity threatens our
Nation's health, security, and industries.
As drug traffickers seek to poison our communities, the
Coast Guard's accomplishment in stemming the tide of illegal
drugs has been impressive. Over the past 4 fiscal years, the
Coast Guard intercepted and seized 888 metric tons of cocaine
worth approximately $25 billion--that's well more than the
Service's annual budget.
At the same time, the Coast Guard is addressing increased
levels of maritime migration to our shores, often in the form
of makeshift vessels that are not seaworthy and threaten the
lives of the occupants. The year 2023 was one of the deadliest
years for illegal maritime migration.
In 2020, the Coast Guard declared that IUU fishing replaced
piracy as the leading global maritime security threat. It harms
the management of fish stocks and costs legal fishing
operations tens of billions of dollars a year in revenue. This
harm is exacerbated by the world's biggest IUU offender: China.
The China Communist Party provides billions of dollars in
subsidies to their distant-water fishing fleet to plunder the
fishing stocks of other nations.
To combat illicit maritime activity, the Coast Guard works
with partner nations and expands targeted intelligence to
maximize enforcement actions. At the same time, these efforts
often pit our Nation's Coast Guard against foreign forces,
including China, which has the largest coast guard fleet.
Despite its best efforts at these missions, the Coast Guard
can only act on a fraction of the intelligence it receives. The
Service's drug and migration interdiction efforts are hindered
first and foremost by a lack of resources, both due to a
longstanding failure to make long-term sustained financial
investments and heightened more recently by manpower shortages
broadly affecting the Armed Forces. In the coming year, this
problem will only increase as the Service is forced to lay up
cutters that would otherwise be engaged in patrols because of a
lack of Coast Guard guardians to man them.
An important part of this subcommittee's work is to conduct
oversight to better understand the Coast Guard's capabilities
and to identify the causes for any mission gaps. As we explore
the Service's law enforcement missions today, I look forward to
hearing what the Coast Guard will do to strengthen its
capabilities.
To Rear Admiral Burdian, I want to emphasize that this
hearing is an opportunity for you to tell us what resources the
Coast Guard needs to accomplish its critical law enforcement
missions. Advocating for its needs has not been one of the
Coast Guard's strengths, so, today, I ask you to be candid.
I would like to thank all of our witnesses for joining us
here today and look forward to a great discussion.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Daniel Webster of Florida, Chairman,
Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation
We meet today to examine the Coast Guard's law enforcement
missions, focusing on the Service's counter drug and migrant efforts,
and its work to limit illegal, unreported, and unregulated, or IUU,
fishing.
I'd like to welcome our distinguished witnesses joining us today--
Rear Admiral Jo-Ann Burdian, Assistant Commandant for Response Policy
at the U.S. Coast Guard; Heather MacLeod, Director, Homeland Security
and Justice at the Government Accountability Office; Aaron Davenport,
Associate Director, Infrastructure, Immigration, and Security
Operations Program, at the RAND Corporation; and Caitlin Keating-
Bitonti, Natural Resources Policy Analyst at the Congressional Research
Service.
The Coast Guard is our nation's premier maritime law enforcement
agency and is actively engaged in countering illicit maritime activity.
This includes stopping the flow of illegal drugs to our shores,
interdicting illegal maritime migration, and protecting the environment
through efforts to curb illegal fishing.
Illicit maritime activity threatens our nation's health, security,
and industries.
As drug traffickers seek to poison our communities, the Coast
Guard's accomplishments in stemming the tide of illegal drugs have been
impressive. Over the last four fiscal years the Coast Guard intercepted
and seized 888 metric tons of cocaine, worth approximately 25 billion
dollars--that's well more than the Service's annual budget.
At the same time, the Coast Guard is addressing increasing levels
of maritime migration to our shores--often in the form of makeshift
vessels that are not seaworthy and threaten the lives of the occupants.
2023 was one of the deadliest years for illegal maritime migration.
In 2020, the Coast Guard declared that IUU fishing replaced piracy
as the leading global maritime security threat. It harms the management
of fish stocks and costs legal fishing operators tens of billions of
dollars a year in revenue. This harm is exacerbated by the world's
biggest IUU offender--China. The Chinese Communist Party provides
billions of dollars in subsidies to their distant-water fishing fleet
to plunder the fishing stocks of other nations.
To combat illicit maritime activity, the Coast Guard works with
partner nations and expands targeted intelligence to maximize
enforcement actions. At the same time, these efforts often pit our
nation's Coast Guard against foreign forces, including China, which has
the world's largest coast guard fleet.
Despite its best efforts at these missions, the Coast Guard can
only act on a fraction of the intelligence it receives.
The Service's drug and migrant interdiction efforts are hindered
first and foremost by a lack of resources--both due to a longstanding
failure to make long-term sustained financial investments, and
heightened more recently by manpower shortages broadly affecting the
armed forces.
In the coming year, this problem will only increase as the Service
is forced to lay up cutters that would otherwise be engaged in patrols
because of a lack of Coast Guard guardians to man them.
An important part of this subcommittee's work is to conduct
oversight to better understand the Coast Guard's capabilities, and to
identify the causes for any mission gaps.
As we explore the Service's law enforcement missions today, I look
forward to learning what the Coast Guard will do to strengthen its
capabilities.
To Rear Admiral Burdian, I want to emphasize that this hearing is
an opportunity for you to tell us what resources the Coast Guard needs
to accomplish its critical law enforcement missions. Advocating for its
needs has not been one of the Coast Guard's strengths, so today, I ask
you to be candid.
I'd like to thank all our witnesses for joining us here today and
look forward to a great discussion.

Mr. Webster of Florida. I now recognize the ranking member
of the committee. You are recognized.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICK LARSEN OF WASHINGTON, RANKING
MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE

Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
And I am going to be brief, and I ask my full statement to
be admitted into the record. We are going to be called to vote
in a little bit.
But I want to make four basic points as we get started.
First, the Coast Guard is facing a 3,000-person shortage, which
has degraded the mission readiness of the Coast Guard. And,
while its mitigation plans will prioritize search-and-rescue
operations, national security, and the Marine Transportation
System, operational status across the Coast Guard will suffer.
The second point is what that means for the three items we
have before us today. On drug interdiction, of the Coast
Guard's 11 missions, the Service dedicates the most resources
to maritime drug interdiction. Despite this, over the past 3
years, the Coast Guard has failed to reach its 10 percent
interdiction goal of known cocaine flow. And so, I think it is
important we understand why that is and how we can rectify
that.
Migration enforcement, the U.S. is witnessing a significant
increase in maritime migration from the Caribbean that is
expected to continue and will further strain limited Coast
Guard resources and personnel. The Coast Guard's role in
immigration enforcement is to ensure safety and engage in
search-and-rescue missions. So, understanding what the role of
the Coast Guard is and how it might be impacted is important to
us as well.
And, finally, on illegal fishing, the consequences of
illegal fishing include international disputes over resources,
overfishing of fish stocks in international and domestic
waters, and humanitarian repercussions such as human
trafficking and exploitation of vulnerable communities through
forced labor. I know it is an issue that a lot of us are
interested in, especially those of us in the Pacific Northwest,
where much of our fishing fleet ends up all over the world.
So, with that, I will close my statement and look forward
to the testimony and yield back.
[Mr. Larsen of Washington's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Rick Larsen of Washington, Ranking Member,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
Thank you, Chair Webster and Ranking Member Carbajal, for holding
this important hearing where we'll focus on the Coast Guard's essential
law enforcement missions: drug interdiction, IUU fishing, and migration
enforcement.
At a time when the Coast Guard is facing a personnel shortage and
impacted operations, it is important for the Committee to take a closer
look into how we can best help the Coast Guard succeed.
In fiscal year 2022, the Coast Guard interdicted nearly 335,710
pounds of cocaine at sea--preventing it from reaching the U.S.
Unfortunately, that number, while significant, only reflects 5.4
percent of the known maritime drug flow.
This 5.4 percent rate is a substantial decrease from the annual
target of 10 percent interdiction.
While this shortfall is partially due to better intelligence giving
us a more accurate understanding of the maritime drug flow, it is also
the result of personnel constraints and decreased asset availability
due to diversion to other missions.
Improved intelligence combined with emerging technologies, like
artificial intelligence and unmanned systems, are promising tools the
Coast Guard can leverage to improve these interdiction rates--but
ultimately, the Service needs more resources.
Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, also known as IUU
fishing, is a serious threat that has vast security, economic,
environmental and humanitarian impacts.
In 2020, the Coast Guard called IUU fishing the ``leading global
maritime security threat.''
IUU fishing includes foreign vessels fishing in another country's
territorial waters, violation of international conservation laws or
tracking requirements and failure to report catches to proper
authorities; often taking advantage of developing countries.
Annually, IUU fishing costs the global seafood industry between $26
billion and $50 billion.
Not only does it lead to overfishing of vulnerable fish populations
and destroy essential habitats but it also threatens global food
security.
Further, forced labor and human trafficking often occur on IUU
fishing vessels, only raising the importance of enforcement.
China's distant water fishing fleet is the largest perpetrator of
IUU fishing, using predatory fishing practices around the world,
violating the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and
failing to regulate vessels that repeatedly violate the law. China also
uses its influence and subsidies to influence poorer countries to turn
a blind eye to IUU practices taking place in their territorial waters.
The Coast Guard plays a vital role in preventing IUU fishing within
U.S. waters and the waters of partner nations. International
partnerships are key in enabling the Coast Guard to assist other
nations that lack enforcement capabilities.
Congress and international bodies like the United Nations and the
International Maritime Organization can do more to combat IUU fishing.
Without adequate resources and funding for the Coast Guard, these
missions will suffer.
The Coast Guard is facing one of the worst personnel shortages in
their history. As the personnel shortage approaches 3,000 enlisted
members, every Coast Guard mission will be impacted. The personnel most
lacking--servicemembers that work on cutters, boat crew, engineers--are
necessary to ensure that Coast Guard law enforcement missions do not
falter.
For too long, the Coast Guard has done more with less, but this is
not sustainable. This cannot continue. To have the Coast Guard this
country needs, we must invest in Coasties by providing the Coast Guard
with resources for effective recruiting and to repair crumbling
infrastructure affecting recruits, cadets, Coasties and their families.
Today I'd like to hear from the Coast Guard about what Congress can
do to help dig the Service out of its personnel deficit. Impacts to
search and rescue, drug and migrant interdiction and IUU fishing should
come as a wakeup call--more funding is needed.
Thank you to our witnesses for their contribution to today's
hearing and working with us to make the Coast Guard the best it can be.

Mr. Webster of Florida. I now recognize the ranking member,
Mr. Carbajal, for an opening statement for 5 minutes. You are
recognized.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. SALUD O. CARBAJAL OF CALIFORNIA,
RANKING MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON COAST GUARD AND MARITIME
TRANSPORTATION

Mr. Carbajal. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I want to take this opportunity to discuss what has been
and continues to be my top priority for the Coast Guard: its
people.
We were recently alerted to major operational changes
underway at the Coast Guard due to a personnel shortfall. While
the Coast Guard's mitigation plans will prioritize search-and-
rescue operations, national security, and the Marine
Transportation System, operational status across the Coast
Guard will be adversely affected. Over 50 stations across the
country will be affected through station downgrades, asset
layups, or station closures.
While the underlying recruiting and retention problems have
been exacerbated by larger workforce trends and a declining
interest in military service, chronic underfunding is a major
factor. The Coast Guard Academy and Training Center Cape May,
the two main points of entry into the Service, are in desperate
need of infrastructure improvements. The first experience with
the Coast Guard must reflect an organization that cares about
and for its people. Congress must do better to support
Coasties, and I hope my colleagues will join me in my demand
for significant increases to the Coast Guard's budget.
This August, I traveled with the Coast Guard to Panama,
where I had the opportunity to see firsthand how the Service
conducts drug and migrant interdiction and its illegal,
unreported, and unregulated fishing missions. I left the visit
with several takeaways.
First, the Coast Guard alone is uniquely situated to
execute these missions. Neither part of the State Department or
the Department of Defense, the Coast Guard is able to form
relationships and enter into agreements that would otherwise be
impossible.
Second, the strong relationship with Panama and the
associated benefits to the United States should be replicated
in many other places across the world. With the current budget,
that is simply not viable.
Lastly, members of the Coast Guard are truly the backbone
of the Service. One day a Coastie may be training Panamanians
to conduct fishing vessel inspections, while the next day they
are interdicting drugs on the high seas. They break ice on the
Great Lakes and issue credentials for merchant mariners. They
are truly our country's best kept secret and value multiplier.
The Coast Guard's footprint, both domestically and
internationally, continues to grow, and the distinct but
related missions we are covering today demonstrate the unique
and important role of the Service.
Combating international illegal, unreported, and
unregulated fishing ensures equitable access to food,
safeguards our oceans, and prevents forced labor and human
trafficking. Drug interdiction stops the flow of drugs before
they reach American shores and combats transnational criminal
organizations.
The Coast Guard's role in migrant interdiction ensures that
the least fortunate among us who choose to board a vessel to
come to the United States do not perish at sea.
I look forward to hearing more about these missions and how
Congress can support Coasties to ensure that the Coast Guard
remains semper paratus.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back.

TESTIMONY OF REAR ADMIRAL JO-ANN F. BURDIAN, ASSISTANT
COMMANDANT FOR RESPONSE POLICY (CG-5R), U.S. COAST GUARD

Admiral Burdian. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Good morning, Chairman Webster, Ranking Member Carbajal,
members of this subcommittee. It really is my honor to be here
this morning.
And, while the topic of this hearing really focuses on
matters of enforcement, I did just want to take a moment as an
operator, as a leader, to acknowledge the mishap involving a
Coast Guard helicopter this morning in Congresswoman Peltola's
district. All four crewmembers are being airlifted to
Harborview in Seattle, and we hope for the very best. And the
team here on the Hill will provide updated information as we
continue to get it.
So, I am honored to be here to share the important work
that your Coast Guard is doing in 3 of our 11 statutory
missions this morning: drug interdiction, migrant interdiction,
and other law enforcement, which really is counter illegal,
unreported, and unregulated fishing around the world.
I want to thank you for your continued strong support.
Without the work that we do together and with your support, we
simply would not be able to do the work to save lives, defend
American prosperity in the homeland, and preserve the
sustainability of our world's oceans.
America's Coast Guard is in greater demand today than it
ever has been. Our crews and the work we do inspires trust and
confidence among the American public and with like-minded
partners who join us in our commitment to promote maritime
governance.
The Coast Guard is one of six armed services, and at the
same time, we are a maritime law enforcement agency. Our unique
blend of authorities and capabilities enable action and promote
joint operations in the interagency and with international
partners.
This is a Coast Guard discussion, so, I hope you will let
me tell a sea story or two to really frame the discussion here
this morning about how we combat complex global threats and
project governance in the maritime domain.
Transnational criminal organizations continue to exploit
the maritime domain to traffic narcotics into the United
States, and this revenue enables TCOs to expand their networks
to other illegal activity. It drives violence, and it drives
instability in our neighbors in our backyard.
Last week, Coast Guard cutter Waesche, which is a National
Security Cutter, interdicted just over 1,500 kilos of cocaine
and detained four criminals from a vessel off the west coast of
Panama in the Eastern Pacific. And, for context, 1,500 kilos of
cocaine is about the weight of a Ford Escape. So, as the
chairman mentioned, the Coast Guard, over the last 5 years, has
interdicted over 800 metric tons of cocaine. I don't know what
weighs 800 metric tons, but it is a lot of cocaine. And, just
last year, we interdicted over 130 metric tons of cocaine. On
average annually over the last 5 years, we have transferred
about 475 criminals to the Department of Justice for
prosecution.
Just this weekend, the Coast Guard and partner agency crews
in the Straits of Florida rescued 35 people from the sea 10
miles south of Key West. Those individuals had clung to their
vessel, which had overturned 2 days prior. And what is truly
noteworthy about this case is that they had lifejackets. In my
experience--and I have done this work for over a decade in that
operational space--the fact that the vessel overturned is not
unusual. Coast Guard crews often see overloaded, unseaworthy,
manifestly unsafe vessels attempting the treacherous journey
via maritime routes to the United States. But what is
noteworthy is that they had lifejackets.
I really want to express my gratitude to the Coast Guard
crews who conduct the migrant interdiction mission with courage
and compassion. This is difficult work in sometimes hazardous
and treacherous conditions, and our crews really set the
standard for compassion and a humanitarian approach of this
lifesaving mission.
Globally, we have seen an increase in illegal, unreported,
and unregulated fishing. IUU fishing undermines the global rule
space order and threatens food security for the over 3 billion
people globally who rely on the sea for their primary source of
protein. Today, as we speak, the Coast Guard cutter Frederick
Hatch is on patrol in Oceania working with Papua New Guinea for
just the second time in history exercising a bilateral
fisheries agreement to help that partner exert sovereignty and
protect resources in their exclusive economic zone.
I also have the pleasure of being one of three tri-chairs
of the Maritime SAFE Interagency Working Group that, under the
Maritime SAFE Act, synchronizes efforts around the world in the
interagency with nongovernmental organizations that work with
our international partners.
Thank you for the opportunity to appear here this morning.
I look forward to our discussion.
[Admiral Burdian's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Rear Admiral Jo-Ann F. Burdian, Assistant
Commandant for Response Policy (CG-5R), U.S. Coast Guard
Introduction
Good afternoon, Chairman Webster, Ranking Member Carbajal, and
distinguished Members of the Subcommittee. I am honored to be here
today to discuss the United States Coast Guard's role in securing
America's maritime border.
The United States is a maritime nation with 95,000 miles of
shoreline and 361 commercial ports connecting 25,000 miles of navigable
channels facilitating the flow of $5.4 trillion of maritime economic
commerce. The Coast Guard is a unique, complementary organization
within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) enterprise. We are at
all times an Armed Force, a Federal law enforcement agency,
humanitarian first responders, environmental stewards, a regulatory
agency, and a member of the Intelligence Community. The Coast Guard is
a nimble instrument of national power. We protect the homeland, save
lives, and preserve the world's ocean. I am pleased to share with you
how we leverage our unique authorities, capabilities, and relationships
with international, federal, state, local, and Tribal partners to
operationalize a layered approach to maritime border security to
protect our communities from transnational threats.
Maritime Drug Interdiction
Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs) harm the American way
of life. They traffic drugs, weapons, wildlife, and humans, which
causes instability and violence in Central America, the Caribbean, and
elsewhere , driving irregular migration to the United States. Illicit
drugs destined for the United States devastate American families,
leading to record-setting drug-related deaths in recent years. Drug
trafficking also destabilizes nations in the region undermines the rule
of law, threatens citizens, and drives individuals, families, and
unaccompanied children to migrate to the United States. To be clear,
the flow of illicit drugs toward the United States funds TCOs, which
pose a significant and growing threat to our national security, the
security of nations in Central and South America, the rule of law
throughout the Western Hemisphere, and governance within the maritime
commons.
Today, TCOs and the illicit drugs they traffic inflict great harm
here, in the United States, as well as in countries where drugs are
grown and produced, and those through which the TCOs transport the
drugs. The nature of the threat to America has changed over the course
of this decades-long fight. Plant-based drugs such as cocaine,
primarily trafficked via non-commercial maritime vessels, are still a
grave threat, but illicit fentanyl, precursors, analogues, and other
synthetic opioids are responsible for 70 percent of overdose deaths in
the U.S. and now the greatest concern. However, almost all the illegal
drugs coming from Central and South America are produced and shipped by
the same TCOs. Notably, cocaine and other plant-based narcotics
continue to form the foundation of TCO revenue streams, even with the
increase of fentanyl and synthetic opioid trafficking operations.
Combating TCOs--Drug Interdiction in the Maritime Domain
The Coast Guard is the only Federal maritime law enforcement agency
with both the authority and capability to conduct drug interdiction
operations and enforce national and international law on the high seas.
The Coast Guard shares the lead for U.S. territorial seas interdiction
and enforcement responsibilities with U.S. Customs and Border
Protection (CBP). Employing our fleet of sea-going cutters, maritime
patrol aircraft, helicopters, and boats, the Coast Guard takes action
against drug smuggling threats far from U.S. shores where the TCOs are
most vulnerable by interdicting bulk quantities of drugs at sea.
The importance of Coast Guard interdictions transcends the direct
removal of drugs from the high seas. When the Coast Guard apprehends
suspects from drug smuggling cases, the suspects disclose information
during prosecution and sentencing that is used to help indict,
extradite, and convict key criminal leaders and further disrupt and
dismantle TCOs. Interdictions also take profits out of the pockets of
criminal networks thereby denying them financial resources.
While more than 75 percent of the Coast Guard's interdictions in
2023 were cued by intelligence, the unexpected unavailability of the
Coast Guard's aging major cutters and other assets used to detect all
the cued drug events limited our ability to interdict more smuggling
operations. Critical acquisitions like the Offshore Patrol Cutter (OPC)
are vital to the long-term success of the Coast Guard's fight against
TCOs. Medium endurance cutters, some that were commissioned in the
1960s, are the critical ``patrol cars'' in maritime interdiction
efforts and are in need of replacement. Additionally, whole-of-
government commitment of detection capability, particularly long-range
patrol aircraft, remains critical to increasing the number of
identified targets that can be interdicted.
Combating TCOs--Interagency and International Cooperation
Continued cocaine interdictions at sea are critical to the fight
against illicit fentanyl because the information and evidence collected
with these seizures offer law enforcement agencies and task forces the
opportunity to illuminate and map the TCO networks. These interdictions
represent the point at which TCOs are most vulnerable and have
supported the development of law enforcement cases against major TCO
leaders.
The Coast Guard continues to be a supporting component in the U.S.
government's approach to identify and disrupt illicit fentanyl supply
chains. In the United States, through Regional Coordinating Mechanisms,
the Coast Guard routinely shares intelligence; coordinates assets for
operational coverage, patrols, as well as responds; leverages resources
to identify the flow of suspected fentanyl and precursors through ports
across the United States; and conducts Multi-Agency Strike Force
Operations with our port partners that help to further disrupt the flow
of drugs.
The Coast Guard has for decades developed and maintained an
extensive array of bilateral and multilateral agreements with nearly
every coastal state in the Western Hemisphere. These agreements provide
the framework through which the Coast Guard effectively and efficiently
pursues maritime interdiction efforts in the region through a
collaborative approach in the mutually beneficial fight against TCO
networks. In addition to directly enhancing Coast Guard effectiveness,
this international cooperation also helps build partner nation capacity
to interdict drugs far from U.S. shores. In fiscal year 2023, partner
nations contributed to more than 75 percent of the drug interdictions
recorded by Joint Interagency Task Force South.
Migrant Interdiction
Coast Guard migrant interdiction operations are, first and
foremost, ensuring safety of life at sea and upholding humanitarian
principles. Every year, thousands of people attempt to migrate via
maritime routes, many utilizing services of organized smuggling
operations and often in dangerously overloaded, unseaworthy, or
otherwise unsafe vessels. Migrants who take to the sea put their lives
at incredible risk. Many of the migrant interdiction cases handled by
the Coast Guard begin as search and rescue missions.
Migrant interdiction at sea is also a critical U.S. law enforcement
mission. The Coast Guard, pursuant to Executive Order 12807, is charged
with interdicting migrants as far from U.S. shores as possible and
returning them to their countries of origin. Swift repatriation deters
many individuals intending to undertake unsafe maritime migration.
Upholding the principal of non-refoulement under international human
rights law, during the course of migrant interdictions, when Coast
Guard crews encounter migrants who manifest fear of return to their
country of origin, these migrants are referred to U.S. Citizenship and
Immigration Services in accordance with U.S. policy for a protection
screening to ensure they are offered protection, if appropriate.
Protection from persecution or torture is an important concern during
migrant interdiction operations.
Interagency Effort via Operation Vigilant Sentry (OVS)
OVS is the DHS Homeland Security Task Force-Southeast's (HSTF-SE)
comprehensive, integrated, national operational plan for a rapid,
effective, and unified response to maritime migration in the Caribbean
utilizing combined Federal, state, and local capabilities. The primary
objectives of OVS are to protect the safety of life at sea and to deter
and dissuade mass migration. OVS, led by the Coast Guard Seventh
District Commander, maintains interagency coordination and has remained
in an elevated posture since August 2022. Although there was a downturn
in irregular maritime migration in February 2023, the Coast Guard
continues to make risk-informed decisions to allocate resources to key
irregular maritime migration routes.
The OVS Unified Command staff continues to advocate, through
strategic messaging, lawful pathways to migrate to the United States.
Additionally, the Coast Guard continues to collaborate with CBP to best
utilize resources to deter irregular maritime migration, increase
maritime domain awareness, and work with partner nations to safely and
swiftly repatriate noncitizens to their country of last departure, when
appropriate.
The Coast Guard employs cutters, boats, fixed-wing aircraft, and
helicopters to identify and interdict migrant vessels as far from U.S.
shores as possible. After appropriate protection screening, migrants
interdicted at sea are returned to their country of origin or departure
via Coast Guard cutters. Key to the ability of the Coast Guard to
repatriate migrants interdicted at sea are the Coast Guard's
relationships and international agreements with partner nations,
especially the Bahamas, Haiti, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic, who
agree to accept maritime repatriation of migrants from their countries
(or who departed from their countries). Loss of the ability to conduct
regular maritime repatriations would be detrimental to Coast Guard
interdiction operations and present significant risk to migrants and
Coast Guard personnel at sea.
Countering Illegal, Unreported, Unregulated (IUU) Fishing
IUU fishing is a pervasive security, economic, and environmental
threat with damaging effects for oceans and coastal states around the
world. By some estimates, up to a third of annual global seafood
catch--approximately 56 billion pounds--is associated with IUU fishing
practices. IUU fishing endangers long-term ocean and ecosystem health
and is a significant contributor to overfishing. It threatens global
food security for over 3 billion people who rely on fish for protein
and jeopardizes economic stability for 800 million people around the
world who rely on fisheries for their livelihood. From an economic
perspective, global IUU fishing catch--valued in the tens of billions
of dollars each year, are a lucrative revenue stream for TCOs and other
malign actors.
At its core, IUU fishing is a symptom of ineffective maritime
governance. It is powered by economic drivers that make it profitable.
These drivers are often associated with forced labor, human
trafficking, and other human rights abuses. IUU fishing actors hide in
areas where maritime domain awareness is lacking and seek out spaces
where flag state, coastal state, and regional enforcement is either
challenging or altogether non-existent. In these ways, IUU fishing
vessels often operate with impunity, with little respect for a state's
laws, and without regard for conservation or management measures put in
place by the international community. IUU fishing practices also
contribute to eroding port and maritime security, as criminal elements
may use similar trade routes, landing sites, and vessels for
trafficking arms, migrants, drugs, and other contraband.
The Coast Guard has been the lead U.S. agency for at-sea
enforcement of fisheries laws for more than 150 years. For decades, the
Coast Guard has worked to leverage its authorities and capabilities to
improve both domestic and international fisheries enforcement, holding
bad actors accountable, and adapting operations as fish stocks migrate
and technology improves the ability to find and harvest catch.
As criminal operations become increasingly sophisticated, the Coast
Guard is uniquely positioned to combat IUU fishing and uphold the rule
of law through specialized capabilities, law enforcement authority,
robust bilateral maritime agreements, and its role as a member of the
intelligence community. However, the Coast Guard recognizes that IUU
fishing is a complex global challenge, and not one that any single
nation can solve alone.
Maritime Security and Fisheries Enforcement Act (M-SAFE)
In 2019, the U.S. Congress directed the creation of a working group
under the M-SAFE Act specifically to address IUU fishing and related
threats to maritime security, such as transnational organized crime,
trafficking, and forced labor. The Coast Guard, along with the
Department of State and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), is a co-chair of the working group, which is
composed of 21 federal agencies.
In October 2022, the M-SAFE Interagency Working Group released its
National Five-year Strategy. This National Strategy established three
strategic objectives to combat IUU fishing:
1.  Promote Sustainable Fisheries Management and Governance
2.  Enhance the Monitoring, Control and Surveillance of Marine
Fishing Operations
3.  Ensure Only Legal, Sustainable, and Responsibly Harvested
Seafood Enters Trade

These goals are driven by national policy, laws (such as the
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act), and
international ocean governance structures (such as U.S. membership
within international Regional Fishery Management Organizations
(RFMOs)). RFMOs are shining examples of multilateral, consent-based
partnerships that develop legally binding conservation and management
measures based on scientific evidence. For example, the Western and
Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), one of the first RFMOs in
the world to employ a fully developed boarding and inspection protocol
for high seas enforcement based on the United Nations (UN) Fish Stocks
Agreement, has produced a level of governance and cooperation for long-
term resource management that was previously unfeasible. The Coast
Guard is proud to have been involved in the development and negotiation
of the protocol, and to participate in its continuing implementation.
The more we strengthen the sovereignty of other nations, the
greater their ability to resist foreign activity that negatively
targets their economic resources. Alongside NOAA and the State
Department, we will continue to work with priority flag states to
identify gaps in fisheries management schemes, monitoring and
surveillance platforms, and enforcement capabilities. The Coast Guard
continues to strive to add fisheries enforcement language into pre-
existing bilateral maritime law enforcement agreements with shiprider
provisions and initiating new shiprider agreements. The United States
currently has bilateral agreements with 12 Pacific Island and 6 African
nations. These agreements are critical to assisting partner nations to
maintain control and maritime domain awareness over activities in their
sovereign waters and ensure compliance with national and international
laws by local and distant-water fishing fleets. Additionally, these
agreements promote effective counter-IUU fishing enforcement
cooperation, as well as critical transfer of knowledge and expertise
which increase overall capability to confront and combat IUU fishing.
The world's oceans contain shared resources, and therefore require
an internationally cooperative approach toward their conservation and
management. In the face of increasing challenges to global food
security and growing demand for marine resources, the Coast Guard
stands ready to confront IUU fishing to ensure the long-term strategic
and economic viability of fish stocks. Doing so increases Maritime
Domain Awareness on the high seas, enhances the Service's ability to
effectively respond to a range of transnational threats, and upholds
the international rules-based order in the maritime domain.
Conclusion
The Coast Guard's layered approach to maritime border security
relies on our unique authorities, capabilities, and partnerships to
address threats as far away from U.S. shores as possible. To do this,
we must continue to invest in our workforce, re-capitalize aging assets
and infrastructure, and explore and integrate new technologies that
enhance interoperability with partner agencies across all levels of
government, including our international partners. The Coast Guard
recognizes the importance and value of working by, with, and through
our partners, because we cannot do this alone.
Thank you for the opportunity to testify today and for your
continued support of the Coast Guard. I would be pleased to answer your
questions.

Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you very much.
Ms. MacLeod, you are recognized for 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF HEATHER MacLEOD, DIRECTOR, HOMELAND SECURITY AND
JUSTICE, U.S. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE

Ms. MacLeod. Chairman Webster, Ranking Member Carbajal, and
members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to
be here today to discuss GAO's recent work related to Coast
Guard missions and resource challenges.
My testimony focuses on Coast Guard asset, workforce, and
technology issues that are affecting the Service's ability to
carry out its 11 statutory missions.
As you know, the Coast Guard is the Nation's lead Federal
maritime law enforcement agency, and its missions, including
drug and migrant interdiction and efforts to prevent illegal,
unreported, and unregulated fishing, are supported by its
people and assets. Coast Guard's personnel stationed around the
Nation operate aircraft, cutters, and boats to protect the
country's maritime borders. In recent years, almost one-quarter
of Coast Guard's operating expenses have gone to drug and
migrant interdiction and illegal fishing missions.
The Coast Guard is constantly trying to balance its
multiple efforts and adjust to a wide variety of tasks and
circumstances to carry out these and its other missions.
Although the Coast Guard has taken some steps to address these
challenges, it should take additional steps to maintain future
readiness.
Our work has noted that declining asset capabilities and
acquisition program delays continue to affect the availability
of Coast Guard assets. For example, the Coast Guard's newest
cutters, the Offshore Patrol Cutter and Polar Security Cutter,
are intended to support law enforcement missions and deliver
greater capability. However, we found that combined, these two
programs are billions of dollars over their initial estimates
and more than 2 years behind schedule. Declining availability
of legacy assets and delays in acquisitions of their
replacements can affect the Coast Guard's ability to conduct
its drug and migrant interdiction and illegal fishing missions.
We made several recommendations in those reports to address
immature technologies and unstable designs, including that the
Coast Guard update its acquisition policies.
Another challenge I would like to highlight is the
uncertainty around the Coast Guard's workforce needs. In recent
years, the Coast Guard has raised concerns that its mission
workload has outpaced its workforce levels. Despite these
concerns, the Coast Guard has conducted limited assessments of
its workforce needs. Specifically, as of March 2023, the
Service reported that it has assessed needs for just 15 percent
of its workforce, a process it began 20 years ago. The Coast
Guard estimates that it is short thousands of servicemembers.
Without workforce assessments, it does not know the true
magnitude of the shortfall and which units or missions are most
affected. Having this information could also help the Coast
Guard target its recruiting efforts.
One of the recommendations from our review is that the
Coast Guard update its workforce planning document with
timeframes and milestones for completing these assessments.
Another area that we have highlighted is the Coast Guard's
longstanding issues with managing its technology resources. For
example, in multiple reviews, we have raised concerns about
challenges related to MISLE, a critical but antiquated data
system that tracks and reports results for nearly every Coast
Guard mission.
However, because of system limitations, it is difficult for
the Coast Guard to compile and analyze even some of the most
basic performance information. For example, the Coast Guard
cannot easily track migrant interdiction data, and officials
told us that they may spend an hour a day compiling it
manually. We have recommended that the Coast Guard identify and
analyze alternatives to MISLE. The Coast Guard agreed, and, as
of June 2023, MISLE replacement efforts were ongoing.
In closing, Coast Guard maritime law enforcement missions
are increasingly vital to U.S. interests. Operations are
becoming more complicated as the Coast Guard acquires upgraded
data systems, aircraft, and vessels. Workforce growth and
enhanced skills will be required to operate and maintain these
updated assets.
Addressing our recommendations will help ensure that the
Service is effectively and efficiently using its limited
resources to carry out these critical missions.
Chairman Webster, Ranking Member Carbajal, and members of
the subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement, and I
would be happy to answer any questions you may have.

Prepared Statement of Heather MacLeod, Director, Homeland Security and
Justice, U.S. Government Accountability Office
Coast Guard: Asset, Workforce, and Technology Challenges Continue to
Affect Law Enforcement Missions
Highlights
Why GAO Did This Study
The Coast Guard--a multi-mission, maritime military service within
the Department of Homeland Security is the nation's lead federal
maritime law enforcement agency. Composed of more than 55,000
personnel, the Coast Guard is responsible for, among other things,
protecting the country's maritime borders from encroachment, defending
against illicit activity, and suppressing violations of federal law on,
under, and over the seas.
This statement discusses: (1) Coast Guard law enforcement missions
related to homeland security, and (2) challenges we have identified and
recommendations we have made to Coast Guard related to managing its
assets, workforce, and technology.
This statement is based on prior GAO reports published from April
2010 through July 2023, along with selected updates on Coast Guard
efforts to address previous GAO recommendations. For these reports, GAO
reviewed Coast Guard documentation, analyzed data, and interviewed
agency officials. For selected recommendation updates, GAO reviewed
Coast Guard documentation and met with Coast Guard officials.
What GAO Recommends
GAO made 31 recommendations to the Coast Guard in the reports
covered by this statement. The Coast Guard generally agreed with the
recommendations. As of November 2023, four of the recommendations have
been implemented, two have been partially implemented, and 25 remain
open. GAO continues to monitor the agency's progress in implementing
them.
What GAO Found
The Coast Guard is responsible for conducting 11 statutory
missions, including three maritime law enforcement missions--drug
interdiction, migrant interdiction, and other law enforcement (which
includes preventing illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU)
fishing). IUU fishing encompasses many illicit activities, including
under-reporting the number of fish caught and using prohibited fishing
gear. In September 2021, we reported that almost one quarter of the
Coast Guard's total estimated operating expenses for fiscal years 2011
through 2020 were for these three missions (annually averaging more
than $1.5 billion).
GAO has previously identified challenges with the Coast Guard's
management of its assets, workforce, and technology that have affected
the service's ability to carry out missions. For example,

In multiple reports, we found challenges with the
acquisition of the Coast Guard's newest cutters--the Offshore Patrol
Cutter and Polar Security Cutter--that are intended to support law
enforcement missions. For example, in 2023 GAO found that these
acquisitions are billions of dollars over initial cost estimates and
over 2 years behind schedule, increasing the risk of capability gaps.
We made seven recommendations, including that the Coast Guard update
its acquisition policy. DHS and the Coast Guard agreed with five of our
recommendations and has taken some steps to implement them.

GAO has found that the Coast Guard has not adequately
determined its workforce needs. The Coast Guard has reported to
Congress that it faces challenges meeting its daily mission demands
because of workforce shortfalls. For example, in February 2020, GAO
found that the Coast Guard had assessed a small portion of its
workforce needs. GAO recommended that Coast Guard update its workforce
plan with timeframes and milestones to meet its workforce assessment
goals. As of May 2023, Coast Guard officials said they had not yet
taken these steps but indicated it could be feasible to develop a rough
estimate of how many positions it plans to assess in the next five
years.
__________
Chairman Webster, Ranking Member Carbajal and Members of the
Subcommittee:
I am pleased to be here to today to discuss our work on the U.S.
Coast Guard's law enforcement missions and resources. The Coast Guard--
a multi-mission, maritime military service within the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS)--is the nation's lead federal maritime law
enforcement agency. Composed of more than 55,000 personnel, the Coast
Guard is responsible for, among other things, protecting the country's
maritime borders from encroachment, defending the nation's maritime
sovereignty against illicit activity, and suppressing violations of
federal law on, under, and over the seas. Coast Guard personnel operate
aviation and vessel assets that include a fleet of about 200 fixed- and
rotary-wing aircraft, more than 1,600 boats, and about 250 cutters, as
of September 2020.\1\ To carry out its missions, the Coast Guard must
maintain these assets while making necessary investments for the future
and operating within its existing resources.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ As of April 2022, Coast Guard officials stated that the agency
had a total workforce of 55,236--including 46,235 military and 9,001
civilian personnel. The Coast Guard classifies vessels under 65 feet in
length as boats, which usually operate near shore, on inland waterways,
or attached to cutters. Coast Guard also operates cutters, defined as a
vessel 65 feet in length or greater with accommodations for a crew to
live aboard.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
My statement today discusses (1) Coast Guard law enforcement
missions related to homeland security and (2) challenges we have
identified and recommendations we have made to the Coast Guard related
to managing its assets, workforce, and technology. This statement is
based primarily on 17 GAO reports published from April 2010 to July
2023 related to the Coast Guard as well as selected updates regarding
Coast Guard efforts to address our previous recommendations through
June 2023.\2\ For these reports, we analyzed Coast Guard documents and
data and interviewed agency officials. In addition, for our selected
updates through June 2023, we reviewed Coast Guard documentation and
met with Coast Guard officials.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Guard: Actions Needed to Ensure Investments in Key Data System Meet
Mission and User Needs, GAO-20-562 (Washington, D.C.: July 16, 2020.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
We made 31 recommendations to the Coast Guard in the reports
covered by this statement. As of November 2023, four recommendations
have been implemented, two recommendations have been partially
implemented, and 25 remain open. We will continue to monitor the Coast
Guard's progress in implementing them.
More detailed information on the objectives, scope, and
methodologies of our prior work can be found in each of the reports
listed at the end of this statement. We conducted the work on which
this statement is based in accordance with generally accepted
government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide
a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit
objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable
basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
Coast Guard Conducts Several Key Law Enforcement Missions
The Coast Guard is responsible for conducting 11 statutory
missions, three of which are maritime law enforcement missions codified
as homeland security missions--drug interdiction, migrant interdiction,
and other law enforcement (which includes preventing illegal,
unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing).\3\ These missions involve
about a quarter of Coast Guard resources. In some cases, the Coast
Guard coordinates its law enforcement missions with interagency
partners.

Coast Guard's missions programs and statutory missions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Drug Interdiction
The purpose of this mission is to stem the flow of illicit drugs
into the U.S., which the U.S. government has identified as a
significant threat to the public, law enforcement, and the national
security of the U.S. The Coast Guard deploys its vessels and aircraft
to disrupt the flow of illicit drugs smuggled from South America to the
U.S. through the Western Hemisphere transit zone--a 6 million square
mile area of smuggling routes that includes the eastern Pacific Ocean,
the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea. In fiscal year 2022, the
Coast Guard interdicted over 335,000 pounds of cocaine, according to
the Coast Guard's fiscal year 2024 budget overview. Figure 1 shows
Coast Guard personnel conducting a drug interdiction operation, which
resulted in seizing 17,000 pounds of cocaine.

Given challenges the federal government faces in responding to the
drug misuse crisis, in March 2021, we updated our High Risk List to
include national efforts to prevent, respond to, and recover from drug
misuse. Ongoing efforts seek to address drug misuse, including through
law enforcement and drug interdiction. We identified several challenges
in the federal government's response to drug misuse, such as the need
for more effective implementation of a coordinated, strategic
approach.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\4\ See GAO, High-Risk Series: Dedicated Leadership Needed to
Address Limited Progress in Most High-Risk Areas, GAO-21-119SP
(Washington, D.C.: Mar. 2, 2021); We issue an update to the High-Risk
List every 2 years at the start of each new session of Congress. The
most recent update was issued in April 2023. See GAO, High-Risk Series:
Efforts Made to Achieve Progress Need to Be Maintained and Expanded to
Fully Address All Areas, GAO-23-106203 (Washington, D.C.: Apr. 20,
2023).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Migrant Interdiction
The purpose of this mission is to stem the flow of unlawful
migration and human smuggling activities via maritime routes. It has
three main objectives: deter migrants attempting to enter the U.S.
through irregular routes and transnational smugglers from using
maritime routes to enter the U.S.; detect and interdict migrants and
smugglers far from the U.S. border; and expand Coast Guard
participation in multi-agency and bi-national border security
initiatives. The Coast Guard interdicted more than 12,000 migrants in
both fiscal year 2022 and 2023--more than double the fiscal year 2021
total, according to Coast Guard data.\5\ The U.S. is currently
experiencing an increase in migrants entering the country by sea.
Global international migration is likely to continue and potentially
accelerate over the next decade, according to the National Academy of
Sciences.\6\ Figure 2 shows Coast Guard personnel conducting a migrant
interdiction operation.

Other Law Enforcement
The purpose of this mission is to enforce international treaties,
including the prevention of IUU fishing in international waters and the
dumping of plastics and other marine debris. IUU fishing encompasses
many illicit activities, including under-reporting the number of fish
caught and using prohibited fishing gear. In fiscal year 2022, the
Coast Guard boarded 81 foreign vessels to suppress IUU fishing,
according to the Coast Guard's fiscal year 2024 posture statement.
Figure 3 below shows a Coast Guard vessel interdicting a vessel using
an illegal high seas driftnet, and Coast Guard officials preparing to
conduct a law enforcement boarding. According to the Coast Guard IUU
Strategic Outlook, IUU fishing has replaced piracy as the leading
global maritime security threat that if unchecked could threaten geo-
political stability around the world.\7\

Law Enforcement Missions Resources
In September 2021, we reported that Coast Guard data showed almost
a quarter of its total estimated operating expenses were for law
enforcement missions related to homeland security.\8\ From fiscal years
2011 through 2020, drug interdiction accounted for 13 percent of its
estimated operating expenses, migrant interdiction 8 percent, and other
law enforcement 2 percent, which includes preventing IUU fishing. The
operating expenses of these three missions annually averaged more than
$1.5 billion over this time period. Vessel and aircraft deployments for
these missions accounted for 30 percent of the average annual
operational hours during that period, as shown in figure 4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\8\ GAO, Coast Guard: Information on Defense Readiness Mission
Deployments, Expenses, and Funding, GAO-21-104741 (Washington, D.C.:
Sept. 15, 2021). The Mission Cost Model is the Coast Guard's official
methodology for estimating annual operating expenses for its 11
statutory missions. The Model estimates the proportion of operating
expenses by mission by (1) multiplying operations and maintenance costs
for supporting a vessel or aircraft by the operational hours and (2)
using survey data to estimate additional personnel costs for nonvessel
or aircraft-based operations. It produces estimates of operating
expenses by mission rather than actual operating expenditures.

Note: Operational hours include the use of aircraft, cutters, and
boats for the Coast Guard's 11 statutory missions. They do not include
the time personnel may spend on missions without using vessels or
aircraft. We do not include hours spent on support activities, such as
training and technology tests. Operating expenses are estimated by
mission by (1) multiplying operations and maintenance costs for
supporting a vessel or aircraft by the operational hours and (2) using
survey data to estimate additional personnel costs for nonvessel or
aircraft-based operations.

Interagency Collaboration
The Coast Guard collaborates with other agencies on certain law
enforcement missions.

The Coast Guard coordinates with other DHS components and
the Department of Defense on counterdrug missions through various
interagency task forces, including Joint Interagency Task Force-South.
In July 2019, we reported on the contribution and allocation of assets,
such as ships and surveillance aircraft, through these task forces.\9\
For example, the task force is allocated assets, such as ships and
surveillance aircraft, from Department of Defense and DHS components,
such as Coast Guard, as well as from foreign partners. The task force
uses these assets, in conjunction with available intelligence, to
detect and monitor the trafficking of illicit drugs, such as cocaine,
being smuggled north on noncommercial maritime vessels across its area
of responsibility.\10\

Activities, GAO-19-441 (Washington, D.C.: July 9, 2019).
\10\ Joint Interagency Task Force-South's area of responsibility
includes the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the eastern Pacific
Ocean.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Coast Guard units also deploy aboard Department of Defense
vessels in support of certain law enforcement missions. In November
2019, we reported that the Coast Guard employs specialized units to
serve as force multipliers, including for specialized capabilities
needed to carry out the drug interdiction mission.\11\ Among these
units, the Coast Guard has two Tactical Law Enforcement Teams which
provide specialized capabilities for offshore drug interdiction and
vessel interception operations, primarily in the Caribbean Sea and
Eastern Pacific Ocean. These specialized teams do not maintain their
own vessels but deploy aboard Coast Guard cutters or U.S. Navy or
Allied vessels.

\11\ GAO, Coast Guard: Assessing Deployable Specialized Forces'
Workforce Needs Could Improve Efficiency and Reduce Potential Overlap
or Gaps in Capabilities, GAO-20-33 (Washington, D.C.: Nov. 21, 2019).

The Coast Guard coordinates with other federal agencies
to address IUU fishing.\12\ For example, in November 2021 we reported
that the Coast Guard and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration analyze data to identify vessel movements and actions
that may indicate IUU fishing.\13\ We also reported that the Coast
Guard had used aircraft to capture images confirming a suspicion that a
vessel was engaging in IUU fishing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\12\ The Coast Guard, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration within the Department of Commerce, the Department of
Defense, and the State Department coordinate with one another, as well
as internationally, to address IUU fishing.
\13\ GAO, Combating Illegal Fishing: Clear Authority Could Enhance
U.S. Efforts to Partner with Other Nations at Sea, GAO-22-104234
(Washington, D.C.: Nov. 5, 2021).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Coast Guard officials told us they use data analysis to
develop lists of vessels suspected of IUU fishing, which contribute to
successful identification of IUU fishing at sea and help guide at-sea
patrol operations to target these vessels. For example, the Coast Guard
identified and interdicted a vessel in 2018 that, according to
officials, was included on a list of suspected vessels after analysis
of location data indicated the vessel was moving in ways characteristic
of using prohibited high seas driftnets. Coast Guard officials told us
they intercepted the vessel, confirmed illegal use of driftnets, and
escorted the vessel to authorities of its flag state. According to
Coast Guard officials, authorities of the flag state prosecuted the
case, imprisoned several people, and destroyed the vessel.
Coast Guard Has Faced Asset, Workforce, and Technology Challenges
Our previous reports have identified various challenges the Coast
Guard has faced in managing its assets, workforce, and technology, as
well as some steps it has taken to address them. These challenges have
affected the Coast Guard's ability to conduct its law enforcement
missions.
Delayed Asset Acquisitions, Declining Legacy Asset Capabilities, and
Cost Increases
In multiple reports, we found challenges with the acquisition of
the Coast Guard's newest cutters--the Offshore Patrol Cutter and Polar
Security Cutter--that are intended to support law enforcement missions
and deliver greater capabilities (e.g., the length of time a ship can
spend at sea) than the legacy assets they will replace (see fig.
4).\14\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\14\ Coast Guard plans to acquire 25 Offshore Patrol Cutters and
three Polar Security Cutters. The Offshore Patrol Cutters will replace
the aging fleet of 28 Medium Endurance Cutters, which have exceeded
their design service lives. They will enable the Coast Guard to
continue conducting patrols for homeland security, law enforcement, and
search and rescue operations. Polar Security Cutters will replace the
aging Polar Star icebreaker and enable the U.S. to maintain defense
readiness in the Arctic and Antarctic regions; enforce treaties and
other laws needed to safeguard both industry and the environment; and
help support other missions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

We found in our summer 2023 reports that, combined, these two
programs are billions of dollars over their initial cost estimates and
are more than 2 years behind schedule, increasing the risk of potential
capability gaps and putting cost pressure on the overall acquisition
portfolio.\15\ For example, in June 2023, we reported that the Coast
Guard projects to have a reduced number of cutters available for
operation starting in 2024 and through 2039 due to the Offshore Patrol
Cutters' delivery delays.

Coast Guard Recapitalization: Actions Needed to Better Manage
Acquisition Programs and Address Affordability Concerns, GAO-23-106948
(Washington, D.C.: July 27, 2023).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have reported for decades that the operational capacity of the
legacy vessel fleet has been declining. For example, we reported in
July 2012 that Medium Endurance Cutters--a key asset for law
enforcement missions that the Offshore Patrol Cutter is to replace--did
not meet operational hours targets from fiscal years 2005 through 2011
and that declining operational capacity hindered mission
performance.\16\ Further, since 2013, the Coast Guard has acknowledged
that its two operational icebreakers--the Polar Star and Healy--are
insufficient to meet its multifaceted mission needs in the polar
regions, which include preventing IUU fishing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\16\ GAO, Coast Guard: Legacy Vessels' Declining Conditions
Reinforce Need for More Realistic Operational Targets, GAO-12-741
(Washington, D.C.: July 31, 2012).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since 2010, the Coast Guard has invested at least $850 million to
maintain the aging Medium Endurance Cutters and the Polar Star
icebreaker. The Coast Guard is investing an additional $250 million to
extend the service life for six cutters and $75 million to extend the
service life of the almost 50-year-old Polar Star until the delayed
Offshore Patrol Cutters and Polar Security Cutters, respectively, are
operational.
We made seven recommendations in our 2023 reports on the Offshore
Patrol and Polar Security Cutters to better align the Coast Guard's
acquisition policy and the programs' practices with shipbuilding
leading practices. DHS and the Coast Guard agreed with five of our
recommendations and have taken some steps to implement them. For
example, the Coast Guard stated that it plans to update its acquisition
policy to require that all shipbuilding programs complete the
functional design of major portions of systems that affect multiple
zones of the ship--such as electricity and water--prior to the start of
lead ship construction.\17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\17\ The two recommendations that DHS did not agree with were
related to the Offshore Patrol Cutter stage 2 program, which
encompasses Offshore Patrol Cutters 5 through 15. These recommendations
stated that the Coast Guard should ensure the stage 2 program 1)
successfully demonstrates integrated prototypes of all critical
technologies in a realistic environment no later than preliminary
design review, and 2) achieves a sufficiently stable design--which
according to leading practices is completion of basic and functional
design, including the routing of major distributive systems--prior to
the start of lead ship construction. We stand by our recommendations
because they align with leading practices.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Uncertain Workforce Needs
Coast Guard challenges with determining its workforce needs
generally as well as for specific key mission needs have affected its
ability to meet mission demands. In recent years, the Coast Guard has
raised concerns that its workload had outpaced its workforce levels.
Notably, in April 2018, the Coast Guard reported to Congress that it
faced challenges meeting its daily mission demands because it was
operating below the workforce level necessary to meet all its mission
requirements.\18\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\18\ Coast Guard, Manpower Requirements Plan Report to Congress,
(Apr.13, 2018).

More recently, in 2022, the Coast Guard reported that operating in
increasingly complex and dynamic security and maritime domains will
become more complicated with technology-driven changes. The Coast Guard
reported that these changes require workforce growth and enhanced
skills to operate and maintain updated assets.\19\ Further the Coast
Guard has a workforce shortfall of approximately 3,500 enlisted
members, according to remarks made by the Commandant in October 2023,
and the service has missed its recruiting targets in recent years.\20\

Although the Coast Guard has expressed workforce concerns, it has
conducted limited assessments of its workforce needs. In 2022, 2020,
and 2010, we reported that the Coast Guard had not adequately
determined its workforce needs.\21\ Specifically, the Coast Guard had
assessed only a small portion of its workforce needs through the
requirements determination process it began using in 2003.\22\ In
February 2020, for example, we found that the Coast Guard had completed
workforce requirements analyses from calendar years 2003 through 2019
for 28 percent of its workforce and requirements determinations over
the same period for 6 percent of its workforce.\23\

Remain, GAO-10-433R (Washington, D.C.: April 7, 2010).
\22\ U.S. Coast Guard, Manpower Requirements Plan, Report to
Congress (Apr. 13, 2018). The requirements determination process
includes a requirements analysis, which is a comprehensive review of
workforce needs, and concludes with a requirements determination, which
identifies the number and type of positions a unit type requires to
meet mission-based capability requirements.
\23\ GAO-20-223. Further, we reported in September 2022 that the
service has faced persistent challenges filling certain cyberspace
positions it considers as critical or understaffed. See GAO, Coast
Guard: Workforce Planning Actions Needed to Address Growing Cyberspace
Mission Demands, GAO-22-105208 (Washington, D.C.: Sept. 27, 2022).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
We found several limitations affecting the Coast Guard's ability to
effectively implement its workforce requirements determination process.
Specifically, it lacks time frames for how it will achieve its
workforce assessment goals--notably, to assess the workforce
requirements for all its positions and units. Among other things, we
recommended that the Coast Guard update its Manpower Requirements Plan
with time frames and milestones for doing so.\24\ DHS concurred with
our recommendations and described actions planned to address them. As
of November 2023, the Coast Guard reported that it had completed
workforce requirements determinations for 15 percent of its workforce.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\24\ We made a total of six recommendations, four of which
addressed limitations with Coast Guard's workforce requirements
determination process. As of November 2023, the Coast Guard implemented
three of these recommendations by updating its guidance, determining
necessary personnel to conduct the workforce determination process, and
tracking the extent to which it completed this process for its units.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
As of May 2023, Coast Guard officials said they had not determined
time frames and milestones to fully implement its workforce
requirements plan but indicated it could be feasible to develop a rough
estimate of how many positions it plans to assess in the next five
years. By updating its plan to complete requirements determinations and
obtaining information on the resources needed to achieve its workforce
assessment goal, the Coast Guard will be better positioned to ensure
that it has the right number of people with requisite skills in the
right units to meet its mission demands.
We have also previously reported on Coast Guard's workforce
challenges related to identifying capability gaps in specific mission
needs, including specialized forces. In November 2019, we reported that
the Coast Guard could benefit from assessing workforce needs for its
Deployable Specialized Forces workforce--multiple units with a range of
specialized capabilities needed to handle drug and migrant
interdiction, IUU fishing, terrorism, and other threats in the U.S.
maritime environment.\25\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\25\ GAO-20-33.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Specifically, we found that the Coast Guard had not used data and
evidence to fully assess its Deployable Specialized Forces workforce
needs.\26\ We reported that conducting this analysis would better
position the Coast Guard to identify capability gaps between mission
requirements and mission performance caused by deficiencies in the
numbers of personnel available.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\26\ As of November 2019, the Coast Guard had 25 specialized forces
teams and 2 units.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
As a result, we recommended that the Coast Guard conduct a
comprehensive analysis of its Deployable Specialized Forces' workforce
needs. DHS concurred with this recommendation, and, in February 2023,
the Coast Guard reported that drafts of the mission analysis reports on
two Specialized Forces unit types were being reviewed, with an
estimated completion of Spring 2023. However, the Coast Guard informed
us that analysis of the three remaining Specialized Force unit types is
subject to available funding and is not yet complete. By
comprehensively assessing Deployable Specialized Forces' workforce
needs the Coast Guard may be able to more efficiently allocate
resources for its Deployable Specialized Forces and the missions they
conduct.
Technology Challenges
The Coast Guard has had longstanding issues managing its technology
resources. The Coast Guard relies extensively on IT systems and
services to carry out its missions. It also relies on operational
technology, which encompasses a broad range of programmable systems or
devices that interact with the physical environment, such as sensors
and radar.
In July 2020, we reported on longstanding challenges the Coast
Guard has had with its IT systems MISLE, which is a data system that
tracks and reports results data for nearly all Coast Guard missions. We
found that the system had some capability gaps, and MISLE users we
spoke to described numerous challenges with the system. For example,
MISLE did not capture migrant interdiction data used to meet
departmental reporting requirements. According to Coast Guard maritime
law enforcement officials, the Coast Guard is responsible for tracking
20 discrete migrant interdiction data elements for departmental
reporting. However, according to these officials, they were only able
to easily aggregate two of the 20 required data elements from MISLE--
date and location of interdiction event--because MISLE captured the
other data elements in user-created narrative entries that were not
easily searched. Coast Guard officials at the time of our review
estimated that they spent 1 hour per day compiling data manually but
could compile the information in seconds if the data were readily
available in MISLE.
MISLE system managers stated they were aware of these challenges,
had begun to address some of them, and agreed that MISLE requires
further investments to meet user needs. However, we found that the
Coast Guard did not follow key systems development processes. As a
result, we recommended that the Coast Guard follow its key systems
development processes to identify and analyze alternatives to select
solutions to meet mission needs. The Coast Guard concurred and said it
plans to replace MISLE. As of June 2023, replacement efforts were
ongoing.
In addition, in July 2022, we reported on various aspects of the
Coast Guard's IT program.\27\ For example, we reported that the Coast
Guard implemented two processes intended to ensure that its IT
infrastructure resources meet the service's mission needs.\28\ However,
the service did not have a comprehensive process that included common
practices for network capacity planning--a key process in IT
infrastructure planning that involves assessing and determining the
network resource needs required to effectively support an entity's
mission. As a result, we recommended that the Coast Guard develop
network capacity planning policies and procedures and implement leading
practices for network capacity planning, among other things. Coast
Guard agreed with each of our eight recommendations and as of January
2023 was taking actions to address them, such as implementing leading
practices for network capacity planning.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In conclusion, the Coast Guard's law enforcement missions are vital
to U.S. interests. The Coast Guard has acknowledged that operating in
the dynamic security and maritime domains will become more complicated
as it acquires upgraded information systems as well as technologically
advanced aircraft and vessels. In addition, workforce growth and
enhanced skills will be required to operate and maintain updated
assets. Addressing our recommendations on managing its assets,
workforce, and technology will help ensure that the service efficiently
uses its available resources to carry out its law enforcement and other
missions.

Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement. I would be pleased

TESTIMONY OF AARON C. DAVENPORT, ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR,
INFRASTRUCTURE, IMMIGRATION, AND SECURITY OPERATIONS PROGRAM,
RAND CORPORATION

Mr. Davenport. Thank you.
Chairman Webster, Ranking Member Carbajal, and members of
the subcommittee, good morning and thank you for the honor of
testifying before you today.
I am a senior policy researcher and associate program
director at the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit and nonpartisan
research organization. Prior to joining RAND, I served in the
U.S. Coast Guard for 30 years in multiple roles, including as
commanding officer of two major cutters performing interdiction
missions in the Atlantic, Pacific, Caribbean, and Bering Seas.
My testimony today is focused on potential ways Coast Guard
interdiction missions could be enhanced. I will specifically
discuss opportunities for better information sharing,
technology implementation, and interagency and international
cooperation and collaboration.
Regarding information sharing, a strong consensus exists
across the interagency that intelligence-driven operations are
key to improving interdiction outcomes. Information sharing
among intelligence and law enforcement agencies and partner
nations often yields the best outcomes when investments are
focused on increasing intelligence gathering analysis and
queuing capability.
Improved data sharing will facilitate more optimal
placement of the limited assets dedicated to interdiction and
help target where diplomatic and economic incentives would be
the most efficient. However, consistency in interdiction data
remains an issue. Both flow and seizure data differ depending
on the source and, therefore, may lead to conflicting or
erroneous conclusions. Having a common understanding of
interdiction data is essential because it contributes to
informed policy development, resource allocation, and
operational decisions pertaining to interdiction programs.
Concerning technology, increasing the use of existing
unmanned systems technology continues to be an important
investment to improve the effectiveness of interdiction forces.
In expansive geographic areas, small unmanned aircraft could be
launched from unmanned vessels that can remain at sea for
extended periods of time. These unmanned vessels could further
be used to monitor illegal activities while remaining
undetected, thanks to their small size.
Additionally, other unmanned vessels and the aircrafts that
would be easily visible to those engaging in illicit activity
could further deter migration, drug trafficking, and illegal
fishing activities.
A RAND Homeland Security Operational Analysis Center study
for Coast Guard aviation found that incorporating unmanned
aircraft is particularly cost effective for detection and
monitoring activities and further recommended unmanned aircraft
as a major element of the future aircraft fleet.
With respect to cooperation collaboration, the U.S. has
achieved the largest increases in interdiction and security
when enabling and working with regional partners. Training
provided by the Coast Guard has been a key enabler of improving
international coordination and maritime interdiction success.
In addition, greater utilization of Coast Guard law
enforcement detachments has been demonstrated to be a highly
successful force multiplier. Establishing and exercising
bilateral agreements also remains crucial. The Coast Guard
could further bolster regional partnerships by providing more
training from law enforcement experts, combined operations, and
logistics support. In doing so, the United States will expand
the jurisdictional reach of its maritime interdiction
operations.
Finally, the Coast Guard could explore other options for
operating to increase its effectiveness in areas discussed
today. For example, U.S. interdictions generally focus on
international waters and noncommercial conveyances, but there
remain challenges associated with coordinating interagency and
international forces, partner nation legal hurdles, forward
basing, and logistics support. An alternative is greater
emphasis on improving intelligence and interdiction measures
through international port state control, which would allow for
additional scrutiny before a suspect ship leaves the source
nation. Efforts to counter commercial maritime trafficking
should recognize the utility of port state control as a choke
point to monitor and control poorly regulated flag-of-
convenience ships suspected of engaging in illegal transport.
In summary, I believe there are multiple options available
to enhance the Coast Guard's interdictions and operations, and
improve outcomes.
Thank you.

Enhancing U.S. Coast Guard Interdiction: Information-Sharing,
Technology, and Interagency and International Cooperation and
Collaboration
Chairman Webster, Ranking Member Carbajal, and members of the
subcommittee, good morning and thank you for the honor of testifying
before you today. I am a senior defense and international policy
researcher and associate program director within the Homeland Security
Research Division of the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit and nonpartisan
research organization. Prior to joining RAND, I served in the U.S.
Coast Guard (USCG) for 30 years in multiple roles, including as
Homeland Security Advisor to the Office of the Vice President of the
United States; Executive Officer, Counterdrug Operations, U.S. Southern
Command, U.S. Department of Defense (DoD); Chief, Office of Cutter
Forces, USCG, U.S. Department of Homeland Security; and as a
commanding, executive, and operations officer aboard multiple major
cutters performing drug and migrant interdiction missions and
international fisheries enforcement in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans
and in the Caribbean and Bering Seas, as well as security cooperation
and joint operations with several partner nations. As a senior RAND
researcher, I have been a lead or contributing author on more than 20
reports and publications associated with USCG operations, strategy,
policy, and acquisition programs and have served as a maritime security
policy and strategy subject-matter expert to the Defense Security
Cooperation University's Institute for Security Governance and the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Science for Peace and Security
Programme.
My testimony today is focused on potential ways the USCG's drug and
migrant interdiction missions and international fisheries law
enforcement mission could be enhanced. My comments apply to all three
interdiction missions, focusing on opportunities to enhance
information-sharing, leverage existing technology, improve interagency
and international cooperation and collaboration, and other options for
operations.
Information-Sharing
Opportunities to improve information-sharing is a persistent
challenge. A strong consensus exists across the interagency that
intelligence-driven operations are key to improving interdiction
operations outcomes. To that end, information-sharing among
intelligence and law enforcement agencies and partner or cooperating
nations often yields the best outcomes while improving resource
allocation. Investments that are focused on increasing intelligence
gathering, analysis, and cueing capability and capacity may have a
greater return on investment than spending limited government resources
on interdiction platforms and other equipment.
My experience and analysis while at RAND strongly suggest that the
international law enforcement community could also derive further
benefits from enhanced information-sharing programs with partner
nations and U.S. interagency partners. It is an imperative that the
U.S. government expand and facilitate the appropriate and timely
sharing of operationally relevant and perishable information between
the United States and foreign partners.
The sharing of data that inform smuggling patterns and interdiction
successes also needs to improve. There is a constant demand for higher-
quality datasets that challenge what is known or perceived regarding
drug and migrant smuggling and regarding illegal, unreported, and
unregulated (IUU) fishing activities. This demand includes better
sharing of unclassified government data that may reveal better ways to
successfully interdict vessels conducting illegal activities. Robust
data that support a wider variety of analyses and allow for thoughtful
discourse among subject-matter experts are an imperative to improving
processes. Continued and enhanced efforts to leverage quality
performance metrics, datasets, and information-sharing programs among
international interdiction regional partners remain an important factor
in reducing the flow of illegal drugs, migrants, and IUU fishing.
Improved data will facilitate more optimal placement of the limited
assets dedicated to interdiction and help target where diplomatic and
economic incentives would be the most efficient. Consistent and routine
capture and analysis of operational performance data could aid in the
optimization of asset placement in resource-constrained environments as
well. Robust information-sharing, operations research, and analysis of
interdiction data can reveal patterns and maximize the effectiveness of
available assets.
U.S. support in the form of information-sharing has been critical
to interdiction operations. This is particularly true with respect to
maritime forces that conduct interdictions within their territory.
However, consistency in interdiction data remains problematic.
Interdiction data differ depending on the source. There are myriad
potential explanations, but the central point is that both flow and
seizure data differ depending on the source and, therefore, may lead to
conflicting or erroneous conclusions and inferences. Having a common
understanding of interdiction data is essential because it contributes
to policy development, resource allocation, and operational decisions
pertaining to interdiction programs and overall counterdrug program
policy.\3\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leveraging Technology
Increasing the use of existing unmanned systems technology has been
and continues to be identified as an important investment for
interdiction forces to improve their effectiveness and reduce manned
assets. Recent RAND reports and researcher commentary highlight the
importance of incorporating unmanned systems technology. Unmanned
aerial systems (UASs) provide situational awareness less expensively
than manned platforms. In expansive geographic areas, UASs could be
launched from and recovered by unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). USVs
that linger in the environment could also be used to monitor drug
vessels and remain undetected thanks to their small size. With the
right sensors, USVs could help detect semisubmersible or submersible
threats. Visible UASs and USVs near shorelines could deter illegal
migration. These systems could also aid in tracking IUU fishing
activities.\4\

A RAND Homeland Security Operational Analysis Center fleet mix
study for USCG aviation completed in 2020 found that incorporating UASs
is particularly cost-effective for scenarios requiring detection and
monitoring activities. Researchers recommended that the USCG consider
UASs as a potential major element of the future aircraft fleet.
Modeling revealed that fleets with UASs performed well across all
mission sets. Using a measured and deliberate approach will ensure that
these aircraft can suitably perform the surveillance mission and that
appropriate numbers are procured to enable an effective and robust
fleet.\5\

Improving Interagency and International Cooperation and Collaboration
The United States has achieved the largest increases in
interdiction and security when enabling and working with regional
partners and organizations.\6\ The United Nations Counter-Terrorism
Centre and the Global Counterterrorism Forum have cooperated to produce
a set of ``good practices'' for border security and management. These
practices include enhancing interagency and international cooperation.
A key enabler of improving international coordination and maritime
interdiction success is through international training. Major
objectives of training are designed to enhance the expertise of law
enforcement activities in countries significant to U.S. efforts,
improve the technical capability of law enforcement personnel in these
countries, and, ultimately, increase the cooperation between U.S. and
foreign law enforcement officials.\7\

Security: Regional Cooperation in Bridge and Insular States, thesis,

\7\ Davenport, 2020.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bilateral agreements have become even more critical for
interdiction operations. The exploitation of Central American nations
by transnational criminal organizations has created a strategically
difficult and destabilizing situation, as movements of illicit cargo
(and people) from source countries often make landfall in countries
incapable of stopping them. The USCG's bilateral agreements with
partner nations, including foreign militaries and law enforcement
agencies, expand the jurisdictional reach of maritime interdiction
operations. Maintaining and advancing bilateral agreements has been a
successful strategy. Thanks to the years of persistent engagement with
international partners to develop these agreements, the USCG has become
dramatically more effective. The USCG could further bolster these
partnerships by providing equipment and training funded through U.S.
Department of State and DoD security assistance programs. Some partner
nations benefit greatly from training provided by USCG law enforcement
experts, while other nations lack standardized boats and communications
packages and are unable to adequately communicate with each other, and
most nations also benefit from combined operations and logistics
support.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\8\ Davenport, 2020.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
An example of a successful program was the Caribbean Support
Tender. Under the auspices of the U.S. Department of State and U.S.
Southern Command, the USCG operated an internationally crewed ship
composed of partner nation mariners and USCG trainers and operators.
The tender's mission was focused on law enforcement training and
maintaining partner nation interdiction competencies. This effort
resulted in directly improving partner nation capability and expertise.
Additionally, the progressive training engagements advanced trust and
cooperative relationships critical to future mission success and
resulted in a stronger coalition of counterdrug forces than what had
existed in the Pacific area of operations, which did not have a similar
asset.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\9\ Davenport, 2020.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In a study conducted by the Naval Postgraduate School, researchers
concluded that the United States must strengthen its partnerships with
transit zone countries, enhance partner nation abilities, and
concentrate its efforts in high-payoff areas of interest; that
strengthening such partnerships builds trust among the United States
and its partners and provides access to geographic areas of interest;
and that enhancing the abilities of partner nations serves to fill
existing capacity gaps borne of declining resources. The United States
cannot effectively provide an interdiction force across a majority of
its 42-million-square-mile operating area and must concentrate its
forces exclusively in high-payoff trafficking areas--specifically,
coastal areas nearest the source zones and at transit zone arrival
points. It is understood that this approach will eventually be
countered, but the gains achieved by this strategy will likely have
lasting impacts on the smuggling enterprise.\10\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\10\ Davenport, 2020.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greater utilization of USCG Deployable Specialized Forces (DSF),
specifically law enforcement detachments, has been demonstrated to be a
highly successful force multiplier. Providing USCG DSF personnel while
exercising bilateral agreements with partner nations, including foreign
militaries and law enforcement agencies, expands the jurisdictional
reach of U.S. maritime interdiction operations. Specifically, ship-
boarding and ship-rider authorities and international maritime
interdiction support could be enhanced.\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\11\ Ship-boarding refers to the standing authority or procedures
for the USCG to stop, board, and search suspect foreign vessels located
seaward of the territorial sea of any nation. Ship-rider refers to the
standing authority for partners to embark law enforcement officials on
each other's platforms, and the officials may then authorize certain
law enforcement actions. International maritime interdiction support
refers to the standing authority or procedures for U.S. law enforcement
assets to moor or stay at national ports and for U.S. law enforcement
officials to board suspect vessels not flying a U.S. or host nation
flag, to escort persons from suspect vessels through and out of the
host nation, and to land and temporarily remain at international
airports for logistics (Davenport, 2020).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Other Options
Despite robust bilateral agreements, U.S. government interdictions
generally focus on international waters and noncommercial conveyances;
there might not be the same level of effort and success (measured in
quantity seized) in the United States targeting flows within other
domains and along threat vectors because of significant challenges
associated with coordinating interagency and international forces,
partner nation legal hurdles, forward basing, and logistics
support.\12\ Placing a greater emphasis on improving intelligence and
interdiction measures through international port state control (PSC)
may assist in better outcomes before contraband leaves the source
nation. One reason why maritime transport offers the greatest success
rate for the trafficking of destabilizing commodities is that it is
more difficult for states to monitor and control maritime avenues than
any other means of international bulk transport. The United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea generally provides flag states with
exclusive sovereignty and jurisdiction over their vessels in
international waters. For example, in most cases, ships suspected of
carrying illicit cargo cannot be boarded, and their commodities cannot
be seized without the prior agreement of the flag state. Therefore,
many ships involved in the transport of illicit cargo sail under so-
called flags of convenience and are registered in flag states with
limited regulation and control of their merchant fleets. Many of the
flags of convenience under which these vessels sail have been
consistently targeted for inspection in other countries by PSC regimes
based on poor performance in previous inspections, but these
inspections are focused more on safety measures than on smuggling or
contraband seizure.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\12\ Gerstein et al., 2022.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In most cases, PSC inspections are the only occasions when state
authorities have the right to board a ship without consulting the flag
state. PSC inspections allow the inspection of the ship, including the
cargo hold and crew's quarters. They also provide a mechanism to
control the movement of targeted ships through detention in port and
even to ban the suspect ships from all ports operating under the same
cooperative PSC regime. Efforts to counter maritime trafficking should
recognize the utility of PSC as a ``choke point'' to monitor and
control poorly regulated flag-of-convenience ships suspected of
engaging in illegal transport.\13\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Foreign seaports represent one potential trafficking vulnerability
because many of the Pacific and Atlantic ports in Central and South
America have poor PSC measures. This results in the exploitation of
maritime shipping containers and other commercial shipping avenues.
This also makes commercial maritime smuggling a more popular smuggling
mode, which is ostensibly underestimated in the flow estimates. PSC
measures is an area where the source and transit zone partner nations
could improve their interdiction efforts. Domestically, the U.S.
government has relied on focused intelligence when performing
interdictions aboard commercial vessels because of the complexity of
both targeting and interdicting containers, as well as the diplomatic
and legal hurdles with flag states, owners, and operators within the
container-shipping global enterprise, which make widespread inspection
difficult.\14\

In summation, there are options available to enhance USCG
interdiction missions to include continuing to improve information-
sharing at all levels, better leverage existing unmanned systems
technology, further advance cooperation and collaboration through
international training opportunities, improve interdiction data and
data sharing, and consider expanding the use of international port
state control strategies as an interdiction tool.
I thank the subcommittee for the opportunity to testify and look
forward to answering your questions.

Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you.
Dr. Keating-Bitonti, you are recognized for 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF CAITLIN KEATING-BITONTI, Ph.D., NATURAL RESOURCES
POLICY ANALYST, CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE

Ms. Keating-Bitonti. Chairman Webster, Ranking Member
Carbajal, and members of the subcommittee, good morning. My
name is Caitlin Keating-Bitonti, and I am an analyst in natural
resources policy at the Congressional Research Service.
As requested by the subcommittee, my testimony will focus
on the United States Coast Guard's role in the at-sea
enforcement of living marine resource laws and international
agreements as it pertains to illegal, unreported, and
unregulated fishing, or IUU fishing. CRS takes no position and
makes no recommendations on policy matters.
Today, I am going to discuss IUU fishing and some of the
negative consequences associated with it, as well as discuss
some efforts by the U.S. Coast Guard to combat IUU fishing. IUU
fishing is an ongoing, multifaceted global issue that affects
the ocean ecosystem and the sustainable management of living
marine resources both within areas of national jurisdiction and
on the high seas. IUU fishing can impact the accuracy of the
data needed to inform fisheries conservation and management
decisions, thereby exacerbating overfishing while threatening
the livelihoods of vulnerable fishing communities and food
security in certain regions.
Experts estimate that one in five fish caught is derived
from IUU fishing, costing the global economy between $15
billion and $36 billion annually.
Over the past two decades, successive U.S. administrations
and Congress have recognized that IUU fishing poses a threat to
national and regional security and have taken a number of
actions to combat IUU fishing broadly. In particular, the
Maritime Security and Fisheries Enforcement Act, commonly known
as the Maritime SAFE Act, was enacted in 2019, establishing a
whole-of-Government approach to counter IUU fishing and to
prevent IUU fish species from entering the marketplace.
The U.S. Coast Guard is a leading agency for U.S.
enforcement of domestic and international living marine
resources laws in the U.S. exclusive economic zone, or EEZ, and
in key areas of the high seas, such as those managed by
regional fisheries management organizations, or RFMOs. RFMOs
are treaty-based international bodies composed of nations that
share an interest in the management and conservation of
fisheries in specific geographic areas of the high seas.
The U.S. Coast Guard works with the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, the Department of Defense, and the
Department of State, among other agencies, to provide a whole-
of-Government approach to addressing IUU fishing.
In 2021, the U.S. Coast Guard outlined actions it would
take to combat illegal exploitation of marine fish stocks. Some
of these actions were also identified as priorities for the
U.S. Interagency Working Group on IUU Fishing, which was
established under the Maritime SAFE Act.
To combat IUU fishing, the U.S. Coast Guard proposes
enhancing its at-sea operations, applying innovative
technologies to detect vessels engaging in suspicious fishing
behavior, and assisting partner nations with fishery law
enforcement in their territorial waters, among other actions.
The U.S. Coast Guard identifies instances of IUU fishing
through its at-sea operations. On the high seas, under the
authority of some RFMOs, U.S. Coast Guard law enforcement
officials may conduct boardings and investigations of vessels
suspected of IUU fishing.
The U.S. Coast Guard reports instances of identified or
suspected IUU fishing activity to other Federal agencies and to
the relevant RFMO to inform IUU fishing vessel lists and other
actions.
According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office,
between 2016 and 2020, U.S. Coast Guard boarded and inspected
227 fishing vessels on the high seas. Because of the size of
the ocean environment, the U.S. Coast Guard may analyze vessel
tracking data, such as vessel position information broadcasts
via automated identification systems, to identify vessel
movement patterns indicative of IUU fishing. These analyses
help target suspect vessels.
The U.S. Coast Guard also works with partner nations to
help build their own counter IUU capacity through training
exercises and bilateral shiprider agreements. Shiprider
agreements are cooperative enforcement arrangements that allow
law enforcement officials from one party to embark on another
nation's law enforcement vessel or aircraft. The Maritime SAFE
Act directs Federal agencies to enter into new shiprider
agreements or add counter IUU fishing provisions to existing
shiprider agreements in priority regions.
This concludes my opening remarks. Thank you, and I look
forward to responding to any questions.
[Ms. Keating-Bitonti's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Caitlin Keating-Bitonti, Ph.D., Natural Resources
Policy Analyst, Congressional Research Service
Chairman Webster, Ranking Member Carbajal, and Members of the
Subcommittee, on behalf on the Congressional Research Service (CRS),
thank you for this opportunity to appear before you. I am Caitlin
Keating-Bitonti, an Analyst in Natural Resources Policy. The
Subcommittee requested that CRS testify about the United States Coast
Guard's role in the at-sea enforcement of living marine resource laws
and international agreements as it pertains to illegal, unreported, and
unregulated (IUU) fishing. In accordance with our enabling statutes,
CRS takes no position and makes no recommendations on legislative or
policy matters. My testimony draws on my own area of specialization at
CRS--federal ocean science policy and relevant international
agreements--and on the input of other CRS colleagues who cover other
issues often associated with ocean policy, including IUU fishing.
Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing
IUU fishing is an ongoing, multi-faceted global issue that affects
the ocean ecosystem and the sustainable management of living marine
resources, both within areas of national jurisdiction and on the high
seas.\1\ IUU fishing can impact the accuracy of the data needed to
inform fisheries conservation and management decisions, thereby adding
to overfishing and threatening food security in certain regions.
Furthermore, the difficulty in regulating fishing vessels on the high
seas may allow some of the vessels involved in IIU fishing to engage in
other transnational crimes, such as labor abuses, drug smuggling, and
human trafficking.\2\

According to the U.S. Coast Guard, IUU fishing has replaced piracy
as the leading global maritime security threat.\3\ IUU fishing
generally refers to fishing activities that violate national laws or
international fisheries conservation and management measures. The
international definition of IUU fishing is provided in the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations International Plan
of Action for IUU fishing.\4\ The International Plan of Action for IUU
fishing was developed as a voluntary instrument within the framework of
the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, which has the
general objective of promoting sustainable fisheries.\5\ In general,

Illegal fishing refers to fishing activities conducted in
contravention of applicable laws and regulations, including those laws
and rules adopted at the regional and international level.

Unreported fishing refers to those fishing activities
that are not reported or are misreported to relevant authorities in
contravention of national laws and regulations or reporting procedures
of a relevant regional fisheries management organization (RFMO). RFMOs
are treaty-based international bodies composed of nations that share an
interest in the management and conservation of fisheries in specific
geographic areas of the high seas.

Unregulated fishing refers to fishing activities
occurring in areas, or fishing for fish stocks,\6\ for which there are
no applicable conservation and management measures and where such
fishing activities are conducted in a manner inconsistent with a
nation's or entity's responsibility under international law.
Unregulated fishing also includes fishing activities conducted by
vessels without nationality within the geographic boundaries of an
RFMO, or by vessels flying a flag of a nation not a party to the RFMO
with authority in that area.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\6\ NOAA Fisheries defines a stock as ``a part of a fish population
usually with a particular migration pattern, specific spawning grounds,
and subject to a distinct fishery. A fish stock may be treated as a
total or a spawning stock. Total stock refers to both juveniles and
adults, either in numbers or by weight, while spawning stock refers to
the numbers or weight of individuals that are old enough to
reproduce.'' NOAA, NOAA Fisheries Glossary, p. 49.
\7\ NOAA, NMFS, Report to Congress: Improving International
Fisheries Management, August 2023, p. 10.

IUU fishing undermines national and regional efforts to conserve
and manage fish stocks.\8\ FAO estimates that one in five (or 20%) fish
caught around the world comes from IUU fishing and, in some regions,
such as in West Africa, it can be as high as 40%.\9\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Illegal fishing can entail fishing for nonpermitted species,
fishing above management quotas, and fishing out of season. These
illegal fishing behaviors can contribute to stocks being fished at
biologically unsustainable levels (i.e., at rates greater than species
can replenish themselves). FAO estimates that the percentage of stocks
fished at biologically unsustainable levels has been increasing since
1970s, from about 10% in 1974 to about 35% in 2019.\10\ In particular,
in 2019, approximately 77% of catch off the Pacific coast of South
America occurred at biologically unsustainable levels.\11\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
By its very nature, IUU fishing is difficult to quantify, but there
is general global consensus that the impacts of IUU fishing have far-
reaching negative consequences.\12\ First, IUU fishing undermines the
sustainable management of fishery resources--resources that provide
both food security and socioeconomic stability in many parts of the
world. Developing countries that depend on fisheries for food security
and export income are most at risk from IUU fishing.\13\ For example,
according to a 2022 report by the FAO, aquatic foods provide at least
20% of the average intake of animal protein for 3.3 billion people.\14\
IUU fishing can inhibit lawful access to this protein source.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A second negative consequence of IUU fishing is that it provides an
unfair advantage to entities that engage in these activities.\15\ For
example, vessels conducting IUU fishing avoid operational costs by not
complying with regulatory requirements and may earn more revenue by
exceeding harvest limits. Conversely, those fishing legally may be
harmed by lower catch rates and higher associated fishing costs. IUU
fish in the marketplace can put legal fishers at an economic
disadvantage and cause them to lose revenue. According to FAO, IUU
fishing catches millions of tons of fish every year,\16\ and experts
have calculated that IUU costs the global economy up to tens of
billions of dollars every year.\17\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Experts note that international cooperation is necessary to manage
many fish stocks because some species move among different national
zones of jurisdiction and the high seas. However, actions to combat IUU
fishing activities are often hindered by the large areas in which
fishing takes place, the lack of resources for adequate enforcement,
weak governance institutions, and inadequate international cooperation.
On the high seas, vessels are subject to the laws of their flag state--
the flag state of a vessel is the nation of jurisdiction under whose
laws the vessel is registered or licensed and is deemed the nationality
of the vessel.\18\ Vessels are also subject to the applicable rules
established by international agreements and conventions to which their
flag state is a party. The expectation is that all fishing nations
exercise responsible flag state control over their vessels, including
their distant water fleets operating on the high seas.

a party to UNCLOS, some members of the executive branch have stated

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
China's Role in the Exploitation of Global Fisheries
IUU fishing occurs throughout the world, and according to the U.S.
International Trade Commission a portion of the seafood entering the
United States reportedly is obtained from IUU fishing activities. The
U.S. International Trade Commission estimated that in 2019 about $2.4
billion (or 11%) worth of U.S. seafood imports were products of IUU
fishing, of which about $204.3 million were obtained from Chinese IUU
fishing.\19\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
China is one of the world's largest seafood importers, having
imported approximately 4.1 million metric tons of seafood in 2022.\20\
Unlike other large importers such as the United States and Japan, the
majority of seafood that China imports is not consumed in country.\21\
Recent estimates have found that nearly 75% of all fish imported by
China never makes it to the Chinese market, but instead is re-exported
into the global market.\22\

identified China as the worst-performing nation overall in combating
IUU fishing.\23\ (The IUU Fishing Index analyzes the performances of
152 nations.) \24\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\23\ In 2021, China received a 3.86 score out of 5.00 on the IUU
Fishing Index (high scores indicate worse performance). The IUU Index
also generally finds that countries with DWF fleets, such as China,
have poor scores. IUU Fishing Index, ``2021 Country Profile: China,''

China has the world's largest fishing fleet, with an estimated
564,000 vessels, and in 2020 was the top combined producer of marine
and inland water catches, making up nearly 15% of global catches.\25\
China also has the largest distant water fishing fleet in the
world,\26\ with an estimated 2,900 to 3,400 vessels according to the
U.S. International Trade Commission.\27\ Distant-water fishing is the
practice of operating fishing fleets outside of your own nation's
Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), the zone that extends 200 nautical miles
seaward of a coastal nation's shoreline.\28\ Distant water fishing
fleets operate either on the high seas or foreign EEZs. Overfishing and
depleted coastal fish stocks in its national waters have led China's
fishing industry to develop a distant-water fishing fleet.\29\

have witnessed some form of illegal fishing, including the removal of
shark fins and the targeting of endangered and protected marine
life.\30\ In 2021, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration's (NOAA's) National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS)
issued China a negative certification for IUU fishing, under the
authorities of the High Seas Driftnet Fishing Moratorium Protection Act
(16 U.S.C. Sec. 1826j(d)).\31\ China denied all allegations made by

Like many governments with industrial-scale fishing operations, the
Chinese government provides financial and policy support to its fishing
industry, including its distant water fishing fleet.\33\ This support
takes a variety of forms, including fuel subsidies, vessel upgrading/
replacement subsidies, and tax incentives. Some analysts argue that
some types of distant water fishing would be unprofitable for Chinese
vessel operators without government subsidies.\34\

vessels, some of which are government-owned or -operated, are involved
in IUU fishing, suggesting that the China is not holding its vessels

U.S. Government Initiatives Aimed at Combating IUU Fishing
Over the past two decades, successive U.S. administrations and
Congresses have recognized that IUU fishing poses a threat to national
and regional security and have taken a number of actions to combat IUU
fishing broadly. These actions attempt to influence the behavior of
foreign fishing fleets through international agreements, organizations,
and trade, because most IUU activities occur outside of U.S.
jurisdiction.\37\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\37\ Actions to combat IUU fishing have included enforcement
agreements with partner countries, trade monitoring, implementation and
enforcement of international treaties, and broad efforts to promote
resource sustainability.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The United States works with other fishing nations through RFMOs
and other multilateral international agreements to sustainably manage
high seas fisheries and address IUU fishing globally. Several federal
agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard, NOAA, the Department of
Defense, and the Department of State, engage in various efforts to
combat IUU fishing on the high seas and in the EEZs of partner nations.
The efforts of these federal agencies include establishing strategic
partnerships; improving enforcement tools, such as high seas boarding
and inspection; identifying and sharing information about countries
that have fishing vessels engaged in IUU fishing activities; and
assisting partner nations develop and maintain their own counter IUU
fishing capacity, among other lines of effort.\38\

In 2019, the Maritime Security and Fisheries Enforcement Act
(Division C, Title XXXV, Subtitle C of P.L. 116-92, 16 U.S.C.
Sec. Sec. 8001 et seq.), commonly known as the Maritime SAFE Act,
passed in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020.
The Maritime SAFE Act seeks to support a whole-of-government approach
to counter IUU fishing, improve data sharing, support efforts to
counter IUU fishing in priority regions around the world, increase
global transparency and traceability across the seafood chain, improve
global enforcement operations against IUU fishing, and prevent the use
of IUU fishing as a financing source for transnational crime.\39\ The
Maritime SAFE Act also established the Interagency Working Group on IUU
Fishing to support and coordinate a government-wide effort to address
IUU fishing globally. The IWG on IUU Fishing is made up of
representatives from 21 federal agencies and is currently chaired by a
representative from the Department of State, with representatives from
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and U.S. Coast
Guard serving as Deputy Chairs.\40\

Administrator.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
U.S. Coast Guard's Role in Addressing IUU Fishing
The U.S. Coast Guard is a multi-mission maritime service with the
authority to conduct maritime law enforcement operations, including
operations aimed at combating IUU fishing activity.\41\ The U.S. Coast
Guard enforces U.S. and international living marine resources laws in
the U.S. EEZ and in key areas of the high seas, and works with NOAA,
Department of Defense, and Department of State to provide whole-of-
government approach to addressing IUU fishing.\42\

The U.S. Coast Guard is the lead U.S. agency for at-sea enforcement
of fishery conservation on the high seas.\43\ On the high seas, RFMOs
manage and conserve fish stocks of a particular species or group of
species within a particular geographic area. The 1995 U.N. Fish Stocks
Agreement provides an enhanced framework for RFMOs' conservation and
management of transboundary fish stocks.\44\ Under the 1995 U.N. Fish
Stocks Agreement, party nations are obligated to regulate ``the
activities of vessels flying their flag which fish for such stocks on
the high seas.'' \45\ In addition, the agreement gives party nations
the right to monitor and inspect vessels of other nation parties to
ensure compliance with internationally agreed fishing regulations,
including regulations established by RFMOs. Violations of RFMO
conservation measures are generally considered IUU fishing.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
U.S. Coast Guard At-Sea Operations
The U.S. Coast Guard identifies instances of IUU fishing through
its at-sea operations. On the high seas, under the authority of some
RFMOs, U.S. Coast Guard law enforcement officials may conduct law
enforcement boardings and investigations of fishing vessels suspected
of IUU fishing.\47\ U.S. Coast Guard law enforcement officials may also
randomly board other vessels as a means to deter IUU fishing activity.
If a U.S. Coast Guard patrol not directly related to IUU fishing
suspects a vessel of IUU fishing, the U.S. Coast Guard may provide
relevant information to other U.S. federal agencies (e.g., NMFS) for
further investigation. The U.S. Coast Guard patrol may also report the
suspect vessel to the relevant RFMO to share information about the
vessel with other member states of the RFMO to aid in the tracking of
the vessel.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\47\ According to NOAA, the United States is a member of nine
multilateral RFMOs. NOAA, NMFS, ``International and Regional Fisheries
Management Organizations,'' at https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/
international-affairs/international-and-regional-fisheries-management-
organizations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The U.S. Coast Guard reports IUU fishing violations identified
through at-sea patrol to RFMOs, which alert the vessels flag state. On
the high seas, vessels are subject to the laws of their flag state. The
U.S. Coast Guard shares information about the vessels it identifies as
having participated in IUU fishing to relevant U.S. federal agencies to
inform IUU fishing vessel lists,\48\ which may trigger port control
measures, among other actions.\49\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\48\ Pursuant to its statutory requirements under the High Seas
Driftnet Fishing Moratorium Protection Act, NMFS prepares a biennial
report to Congress that includes a list of nations whose flagged
vessels were identified for IUU fishing (16 U.S.C. Sec. 1826h).

Measures Agreement,'' at https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/enforcement/

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Experts consider high seas boarding and inspection of vessels to be
effective approaches for fisheries law enforcement and for identifying
vessels engaged in IUU fishing.\50\ According to the U.S. Government
Accountability Office (GAO), from 2016 through 2020, the U.S. Coast
Guard boarded and inspected 227 fishing vessels on the high seas within
the boundaries of RFMOs to which the United States is a party.\51\
During these inspections, the U.S. Coast Guard found 90 potential
violations of RFMO fishery conservation and management measures.\52\
The information obtained by the U.S. Coast Guard through vessel
boardings and inspections can inform U.S. diplomatic engagements with
foreign nations. However, only a subset of RFMOs have high seas
boarding and inspection measures. The Interagency Working Group on IUU
Fishing identified the need for more RFMOs to adopt high seas boarding
and inspection measures.\53\ According to GAO, the U.S. Coast Guard,
Department of State, and NOAA are working to promote the adoption of
high seas boarding and inspection measures in all RFMOs to which the
U.S. is a member.\54\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
U.S. Coast Guard Use of Vessel Tracking Data
The scale of the ocean environment enables some fishing fleets to
conduct IUU fishing activity unnoticed and presents law enforcement
challenges. The International Maritime Organization and other
management bodies require large ships, including many commercial
fishing vessels, to broadcast their position with an automatic
identification system (AIS).\55\ In addition to broadcasting the
location of the vessel, AIS devices also broadcast information about
the identity, course and speed of the vessel. Radio stations and
satellites pick up this information, making vessels trackable even in
the most remote areas of the ocean.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\55\ Global Fishing Watch, ``What Is AIS?,'' at https://
globalfishingwatch.org/faqs/what-is-ais/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The U.S. Coast Guard analyzes vessel tracking data to identify
movement patterns that may be indicative of IUU fishing activity.\56\
Fishing vessels that ``go dark'' by ceasing to broadcast position
information may suggest that these vessels are engaging in IUU fishing
activities. Research conducted by NOAA, the University of Santa Cruz,
and Global Fishing Watch found that vessels most often go dark while
fishing next to EEZs with contested boundaries, fishing in EEZ with
limited management oversight, and during the transfer of fish between
fishing vessels and refrigerated cargo vessels.\57\ The U.S. Coast
Guard analyzes vessel tracking data to help guide at-sea patrol
operations to target suspect vessels.

In its IUU Fishing Strategic Outlook Implementation Plan, the U.S.
Coast Guard acknowledged that it will continue to advance and implement
innovative technology to counter IUU fishing and to expand multilateral
fisheries enforcement cooperation with partner nations.\58\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Outlook Implementation Plan, July 2021, pp. 26-27.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
U.S. Coast Guard Efforts to Build Capacity for Partner Nations
The U.S. Coast Guard works with partner nations to develop and
maintain their own counter IUU fishing capacity, including the
enforcement of their own fisheries conservation measures and the
investigation and prosecution of their own fishing fleets suspected of
IUU fishing. According to its IUU Fishing Strategic Outlook
Implementation Plan, the U.S. Coast Guard aims to create regionally
based international fisheries law enforcement symposiums for foreign
partners, support expanded unclassified information sharing about
illicit operations, and add counter-IUU fishing measures to existing
bilateral agreements, among other initiatives to combat IUU
fishing.\59\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\59\ USCG, Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing Strategic
Outlook Implementation Plan, July 2021, pp. 26-27.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
One strategy used by the U.S. Coast Guard to help foreign partners
build capacity for counting IUU fishing is through shiprider
agreements.\60\ Shiprider agreements authorize a law enforcement
official of one party to embark on a law enforcement vessel, or
aircraft, of the other party and exercise certain authorities. U.S.
shiprider agreements are designed to allow U.S. law enforcement
officials, typically U.S. Coast Guard law enforcement officials, to
assist partner nations in combating various illicit maritime activity,
such as IUU fishing. In general, U.S. bilateral shiprider agreements
allow maritime law enforcement officers of a partner nation to embark
on vessels (and/or aircraft) of the U.S. government. The presence of a
shiprider on board a U.S. government vessel allows the vessel to
enforce the laws and regulations of the partner nation, including the
boarding and inspection of suspect vessels, within the partner nation's
designated territorial sea or exclusive economic zone. Certain
shiprider agreements also allow U.S. government vessels with embarked
shipriders to pursue flag ships of the party on the high seas.

Strategy for Combating Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing:
2022-2026, Report to Congress, October 2022, p. 15.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not all U.S. bilateral shiprider agreements include counter-IUU
fishing provisions. According to GAO, the United States has entered
into 15 shiprider agreements that address IUU fishing.\61\ One priority
of the Interagency Working Group on IUU Fishing is for the U.S.
government to establish new bilateral shiprider agreements that have
counter-IUU fishing provisions with countries located within priority
regions and to add counter-IUU fishing provisions to existing shiprider
agreements.\62\

92) directs select federal officials to ``exercise existing shiprider
agreements and to enter into and implement new shiprider agreements''
(16 U.S.C. Sec. 8013(b)(2)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The U.S. Coast Guard also coordinates with the Department of
Defense in their at-sea exercises. Some of these exercises may be
designed to help partner nations build maritime security capacity,
including their capacity to address IUU fishing in their territorial
waters and IUU fishing committed by their flagged vessels. For example,
the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Africa Command collaborated to enhance
partner nation maritime enforcement capabilities to counter IUU fishing
and other issues.\63\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Defense collaborated with partner African nations to help them build
maritime security capacity through the U.S. Africa Commands Africa

In its FY2024 budget overview, the U.S. Coast Guard also identified

partnerships, aimed at combating IUU fishing off the east and west
coasts of South America, off the west coast of Africa, and in the
Pacific.\64\

Conclusion
This concludes my prepared remarks. Thank you for the opportunity
to testify, and I welcome your questions. If additional research and
analysis related to this issue would be helpful, my CRS colleagues and
I stand ready to assist the committee.

Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you very much.
So, I now recognize myself, but I would like to say we just
appreciate all of you coming back. I appreciate it. So, I will
turn to questions of the panel, and I am going to be first. I
will recognize myself for 5 minutes of questions.
So, Rear Admiral Burdian, in the last 2 fiscal years, the
Coast Guard interdicted more than 12,000 migrants attempting to
cross our maritime border, more than double the figure that
crossed in 2021.
Can you explain the impact the increase in migrants has on
overall law enforcement missions? For example, have other
missions like drug interdiction had to scale back because of
the increase in migrant interdictions?
Admiral Burdian. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
As you mentioned, since February of 2021, the Coast Guard
has seen historic levels of irregular maritime migration in the
maritime approaches to the southeastern United States, as well
as in the Mona Passage, which really connects the maritime
routes to the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.
There has been an impact to other missions, from maritime
patrol, aircraft coverage to the International Ice Patrol, to
our ability to provide surface and air assets in support of the
counterdrug mission in the Joint Interagency Task Force South
area of responsibility. We remain at Operation Vigilant Sentry,
phase 1 Bravo, which is the phase at which we operate to
prevent a mass maritime migration, and that demands greater
coordination among DHS partners. The Homeland Security Task
Force Southeast is a DHS construct under Joint Task Force East
and is how we share intelligence, coordinate operations, and
create a force laydown to deter and prevent that mass
migration, sir.
Mr. Webster of Florida. So, in your estimation, are there
particular policies that are driving the increase in migration?
Admiral Burdian. So, I think having been on the water and
seeing face-to-face some of these individuals who have made
what I imagine is a near impossible choice to take to the sea
with one's family, I think the drivers of that kind of
decisionmaking are complicated, sir.
What I can tell you is coastguardsmen every single day
approach these missions as lifesaving operations, and they do
so with humility and compassion. And there certainly are
complex policy decisions to be made, but those remain outside
of the Coast Guard, sir.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Ms. MacLeod, to what extent does
the Coast Guard's lack of sufficient assets hinder the ability
to carry out the law enforcement missions?
Ms. MacLeod. So, collectively, our work has shown that the
Coast Guard has struggled with foresight in this area, managing
towards a future that might look different than the past. They
often have assets and people working on missions
simultaneously, but the Coast Guard has not accurately
distinguished the priority of its missions or resources or
successfully identified how to assess tradeoffs among its many
priorities. We think that data improvements could assist the
Coast Guard in this area.
Mr. Webster of Florida. So, is that why you can--I mean,
the mitigations, those challenges have been so difficult is
because it is so spread out, or what would you say?
Ms. MacLeod. I think, without having the most foundational
basic data information systems that support analysis of looking
towards the various missions and resources that are being
expended towards those missions, enabling the Coast Guard to
prioritize among them is a major challenge, yes.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Rear Admiral, would you like to
respond to that question?
Admiral Burdian. Yes. Thank you.
I think the Coast Guard did establish an Office of Data and
Analytics in 2022 so that we can get into the big data
business, so that we can use past performance to be an
indicator of future priority.
Likewise, I will say, you, sir, in your opening, mentioned
resources. And I think to be the Coast Guard of the future by
2033, we would offer that we need to be a $20 billion Coast
Guard, to have 3 to 5 percent of sustained growth in our
operating budget so that we can't just maintain the Coast Guard
we have. Right? You all have been very generous, and we have
been grateful for your support. But, as we look to the future,
we really do need that 3 to 5 percent of sustained growth in
our operating budget to build a Coast Guard of the future.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you.
Mr. Davenport, in your testimony, you noted the importance
of leveraging technology. Can you discuss some of the ways that
the Coast Guard can leverage their unmanned systems and other
similar technologies to improve its execution of law
enforcement missions?
Mr. Davenport. Yes, sir. Thank you for the question.
I strongly believe that the Coast Guard could better
leverage what unmanned systems could provide. The Coast Guard's
manned assets spend arguably a large portion of their time
searching and locating. With UAS, unmanned system technology,
this could be relieved, and it would be more efficient. You may
locate them quicker, but also, it would save all the time and
effort in the search.
Mr. Webster of Florida. OK. Thank you very much. I am out
of time.
Mr. Carbajal, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you, Mr. Chair. You are the chairman.
You are never out of time.
Thank you.
First, let me say to Admiral Burdian how I think the
chairman and myself and everybody, we share our concern for the
families and the Coast Guard personnel that were involved in
the accident, the MH-60 accident that transpired when they were
doing search and rescue in Alaska. And we wish them a speedy
recovery, and our thoughts are with their families.
Secondly, I had the privilege of being with you at the
JIATF South in the Florida Keys, along with the previous
Commandant, and it is great to see you have risen even further
in your career, and it is great for the Coast Guard, great for
our country, that you are where you're at. So, I just wanted to
recognize you for your leadership.
Ms. MacLeod, issuing over 17 reports between 2010 and now,
GAO has been raising red flags about Coast Guard planning and
resources for a while. Now that we are amid a serious workforce
shortage, what should the Coast Guard be doing?
Ms. MacLeod. Correct, we have issued numerous
recommendations in these areas of strategic planning for the
Coast Guard. And specifically in its workforce planning, I
think that one area the Coast Guard could do better is a risk-
based approach. For example, in our work on the marine
inspection workforce and gas carrier examinations, we found
that a risk-based approach to these examinations could better
utilize the marine inspection workforce and provide some
benefit in terms of resources for personnel going forward. So,
that is just one suggestion we have.
And I will just say, in response to the numerous
recommendations we have outstanding to the Coast Guard in these
areas, we are consistently following up with the Coast Guard
and working on these. Many of these recommendations we have
made to them in the last 3 years, and we are seeing some
progress, but as the Coast Guard faces workforce shortages like
the other military services, addressing our recommendations
will become even more important.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you.
Admiral Burdian, the Coast Guard is nothing without its
people. When stations and cutters are short-staffed, what does
that mean for the Coasties? If the Coast Guard could
appropriate $500 million for infrastructure needs at the Coast
Guard Academy and Cape May as well as for recruiting, how would
that affect the shortfall?
Admiral Burdian. Thank you, Mr. Carbajal.
I will say to your first question, when units are short,
what we do is drive risk down to the operational commander.
What we say to our crews is, ``Go ahead and do more with less,
but be careful.'' The efforts we are undertaking now to
temporarily realign our workforce really are in response to
that known risk so that we can take an enterprisewide view with
regard to how these existing personnel shortfalls impact our
ability to execute the mission. And you have read and have been
briefed by the teams that we really are prioritizing
lifesaving, Homeland Security, and preservation of the MTS.
With the addition of funds, as you know, in the 2024
President's budget and the unfunded priorities list, there are
projects for both the Coast Guard Academy and Training Center
Cape May, at Cape May to create the new training complex for
recruits and at the Coast Guard Academy to make improvements to
Chase Hall.
I think it is important just to acknowledge that all--like,
100 percent of our Active and Reserve Component, officer and
enlisted, flow through those two accession points. And so, if
we say we are going to invest in our people and we were
provided those additional resources, that is where they would
go.
I would also say, we would take the opportunity to expand
our recruiting workforce. Coast Guard recruiters are excellent
at what they do. And you know us well as our committee of
primary jurisdiction, the Coast Guard sort of sells itself once
we are in the room.
On average, Coast Guard recruiters recruit 12 people per
year, and that is compared to our DoD counterparts that recruit
about 9 folks per year. So, when we are in the space, when we
have the recruiting team in place, I think we can be
successful.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you.
And, going to the right places to recruit is also very
important if I should say.
Dr. Keating-Bitonti, I recently had the opportunity to see
the Coast Guard's presence and partnership in Panama firsthand.
There the Coast Guard is capacity building and conducting law
enforcement.
What should Congress and the administration be doing to
better leverage the Coast Guard's international status?
Ms. Keating-Bitonti. I think to address IUU fishing broadly
and especially building partner nations' capacity, it involves
a whole-of-Government approach. There are resources that the
Coast Guard could be using to encourage other countries to
review the assets and technologies that they have available to
address IUU fishing within their waters.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you.
And, lastly, just to conclude real quick, Mr. Davenport,
your testimony focuses on ways to enhance the Coast Guard's IUU
and drug and migrant interdiction missions.
What can you say about the Coast Guard's resources, given
the current workforce shortages combined with the increased
migrant flow? What will happen to the percent of drugs
interdicted if Congress does not increase appropriations?
Mr. Davenport. I can only assume, if they do not have
enough assets, that that would increase the flow. However, I
think there are ways that they could increase interdiction by
driving it down and working more with the partner nations and
enabling them through the use of a very successful tool, which
is law enforcement detachments combined with bilateral
agreements.
And the other big one that I have seen over the years is
the effect that international training has on the capability
and capacity of partner nations and cooperative operations.
And the last point I would make is that what was most
successful is approaching these problems from a regional
standpoint and not just one nation to one nation. The most
successful ones have been when you do a regional effort.
Thank you.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you.
I am out of time, Mr. Chair. I yield back.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Mr. Babin, you are recognized for 5
minutes.
Dr. Babin. Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you all for being here, you witnesses.
As one of the cochairs of the House Border Security Caucus,
I believe this hearing is vital. Thank you for being here.
Enforcing our maritime border security, disrupting
international drug and human smuggling activities, and
protecting American waters from illegal foreign fishing is all
vital for our Nation, and I appreciate all of the work that the
Coast Guard is doing in this space.
Admiral Burdian, the first question I would like to ask is,
I represent part of the gulf coast in southeast Texas. Many
folks in the shrimping industry have been feeling a lot of pain
lately. In fact, they are having a problem keeping the lights
on on their boats. Foreign shrimpers, however, are apparently
having a heyday. They have been dumping shrimp into the
American economy, driving prices down, and harming the
livelihood of individuals in my district and several other
districts that are surrounding me.
I understand that you are not responsible for trade
policies, but I would like to know if you've seen an uptick in
illegally harvested shrimp and if you are aware of the impact
that it is having on American shrimpers.
Admiral Burdian. Thanks for the question, Mr. Babin.
We routinely patrol the maritime boundary line in the Gulf
of Mexico to counter illegal fishing in the U.S. EEZ. I will
say the majority of our work thus far has been with regard to
snapper, primarily Mexican launches crossing the maritime
boundary line. Though in advance of the hearing, I was made
aware of this particular issue and will coordinate with our
partners in NOAA who primarily oversee the imports to discuss
with them, and we can get back to you on that, sir.
Dr. Babin. Sure. That would be fine.
Admiral Burdian. Yes, sir.
Dr. Babin. I have several other questions I would like to
ask you. But that is an acute problem for our American
shrimpers, and I would hope that the Coast Guard would at least
be aware of that.
The entire country and, likely, the entire world, is paying
attention to what is happening in our southwest border, and our
open border policies have been received as an open invitation
for millions, almost 10 million illegal immigrants, to simply
show up, sign a few documents, download an app, and then be
released into the interior of our country.
It is my belief that the White House and the administration
is directly responsible for this situation at our southern
border. The Secretary of Homeland Security has been complacent
at best throughout the last few years, in my opinion, and
completely failed in his duty to protect the Nation's interior,
even saying our borders are secure, he has operational control,
when nothing could be further from the truth.
I am just curious whether the White House or anyone else in
this administration, Homeland Security, DOT, Department of
Defense, anyone else has ever pressured the Coast Guard on its
migrant interdiction mission. What sort of conversations have
you had with the administration officials on your migrant
interdiction mission? And has the mission or the associated
policies changed since January of 2021? Just quickly.
Admiral Burdian. Sir, we routinely have discussions with
partners in interagency and policy discussions up the chain
through DHS and with the White House with regard to maritime
migration. Those discussions surround how best to support the
Coast Guard in these lifesaving missions and what resources we
need to continue to coordinate with our partners in the
Department of Homeland Security and with international and
interagency partners sort of in a vertically integrated
Government.
Dr. Babin. OK. All right. How much of an increase in
trafficked fentanyl and fentanyl precursors have you seen?
There are three precursors to fentanyl. I serve on the House
Task Force to Combat Mexican Drug Cartels where we have been
studying the cartel business plan and how they operate in the
United States, how they make money, et cetera. The cartels'
fentanyl is made up of a number of precursors that largely come
from China.
Does your drug interdiction mission consider precursors as
a priority either directly from Chinese sources or possibly
smuggled through other foreign-flag vessels?
Admiral Burdian. Sir, those precursors are primarily
moving, as I understand it, in containerized cargo into ports
in other countries such as Mexico. We have worked with our
partners in SEMAR and SEDATU to really build some capacity to
understand governance in ports and get after that issue. We are
not seeing finished fentanyl move in the maritime, with very,
very minor exceptions, sir, but I will say that the cartels,
whether it's Mexican cartels or cartels in Colombia, are
operating agnostic to product.
And so, every kilo of cocaine the Coast Guard interdicts
serves to undermine the profit motivation and undermine the
financial resource of these transnational criminal actors and
the violence and instability they sow in the region.
Dr. Babin. And that is exactly what needs to happen. We
have to bust up their profit motive and their business model.
Thank you very much.
And I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Mr. Garamendi, you are recognized
for 5 minutes.
Mr. Garamendi. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
A couple of quick questions, mundane perhaps, but all
politics are local.
So, when the Coast Guard decides to move the Military Ocean
Terminal Concord, MOTCO, the escort and patrol for the ships
that are coming and going, carrying the munitions, why did you
move from Vallejo, in my district, directly across the river of
MOTCO, to San Francisco? And the impact that that has on the
salary structures: interesting. I will let it just hang out
there. I would like to hear from you about the salary
structures as a result of that move from my district to San
Francisco, and she is no longer Speaker.
And you also discussed the issue of tracking, monitoring,
finding out what is going on out there. And, Mr. Davenport, you
raised the issue of unmanned vessels observation. Have you gone
beyond just those that are at sea to those that are in the air
and those that might be available through various commercial
satellite operations and organizations?
Mr. Davenport. Thank you.
Actually, there has not been much exploration in space, but
I will say that I lead a project for the Coast Guard. It is
called Evergreen. It is looking into the future. And space is
one of the focal areas that we will be focusing on in the next
3 years.
Mr. Garamendi. I would highly suggest you do. There are
commercial operations that are ever increasing with various
satellite technologies that can provide almost daily a view of
the entire world and might be available to deal with this issue
of identifying where the problem might be, illegal fishing,
contraband of all kinds.
So, I would like to hear from you about that. And, Admiral,
if you will pay attention to that also. You are welcome to
comment, Admiral, if you would like to about--you might want to
pick up the issue of the University of California San Diego and
the laboratory that exists out there with Scripps working with
the Coast Guard on these unmanned vessels.
Admiral Burdian. Yes, sir. We are in the midst of a
contract using unmanned surface vessels right now and trying to
understand how they can help us with domain awareness in
multiple mission sets, but primarily in maritime migrant
interdiction. And I will say that the Deputy Commandant for
Operations just last year released a strategy on unmanned
systems, and my partners in the Acquisition and Capabilities
Directorate at headquarters are actively working to accelerate
how we get into that space in earnest.
Mr. Garamendi. Thank you.
It may very well be that we will have to move very rapidly
on these unmanned systems because our new manned systems seem
to be way behind schedule. I suppose if we would beat this drum
enough, we might actually be able to bend some steel and get
some ships out to sea. So, that is an ongoing issue I am sure
this committee will be dealing with and having to do with the
Offshore Patrol Cutters and, of course, some day, maybe--oh,
no. We are never going to have an Arctic icebreaker. Hopeful.
Finally, about your budget, about recruiting and all that
goes with it, it comes back to the Congress, and that is, do
you have an adequate budget to hire the people that you need
for the ships? Apparently the indication from Ms. MacLeod is
that you don't. Would you care to opine on this for 1 minute or
less, Admiral?
Admiral Burdian. Sir, I know that Congress is in the
position of making tough choices about where to apply
appropriated dollars. And we, likewise, as the executive, are
in the tough--in the business of making tough choices about
sometimes having to find economy. So, certainly with additional
resources, we absolutely would invest in the accession points
where all of our recruits and officer candidates enroll into
the Coast Guard, embrace our core values, and create the values
and activities as leaders that are the key component of our
efforts to retain the best workforce.
Mr. Garamendi. If I might interrupt in my last 20 seconds,
we are going to spend a lot of time here, this week and perhaps
later, dealing with the Secretary of Homeland Security. I would
suggest our time might be better spent providing an adequate
appropriation for that Department as well as for the Coast
Guard.
And, with that, I yield back.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Mr. Graves is recognized for 5
minutes.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
First, I want to thank you very much. I think you were
awakened months ago at 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning to help
out with a search-and-rescue mission for one of our
constituents, and I just want to thank you very much for going
above and beyond in all of your help in helping out with one
our constituent families. I know you know the awful outcome of
that situation. But your assistance--we are very grateful for
that, as is the family of Cameron Robbins. So, I just want to
say thank you.
Secondly, I want to congratulate you, a little bit late,
but on the promotion. Certainly, I have watched your career
blossom over the years, and congratulations.
Admiral, one of the largest obstacles we have in IUU is
being able to identify the illegal fisheries that ends up being
commingled in with other perhaps legal fish and then put onto
global markets and ultimately to consumers' plates. What has
the Coast Guard learned from its participation in the Maritime
SAFE Interagency Working Group to help inform us what else we
could be doing, what other tools or authorizations we could be
giving the Coast Guard to help to decipher or to weed out some
of the illegally caught fisheries that we know China and other
countries are currently fishing?
I believe one in every five fish right now is IUU
fisheries. I need to give a shout out to my friend Jared
Huffman, which I rarely do, but I want to take this opportunity
because he and I did work--[to Rep. Huffman] well, it's only
when you do good things, which has been fewer and further
between lately.
But, seriously, I want to thank my friend, Jared Huffman,
for the work that we did on a bipartisan basis in the NDAA to
help improve IUU enforcement actions. But if you could respond
to the question on additional tools and authorizations.
Admiral Burdian. Thank you, Mr. Graves. It is good to be
here in this capacity. I feel proud to sit before the committee
given my history in the room here. I think the M-SAFE's
Interagency Working Group, the power is in our ability to layer
authorities and really drive outcomes and to build capacity in
particular in the five priority flag states. There was an
interagency team in Senegal just last week, working with that
country to really understand what they need to create a legal
framework to elevate their ability to conduct enforcement in
the Gulf of Guinea and really drive towards solutions for those
artisanal fishers who rely so much on successful fisheries for
their livelihood. So, not at a national level but really at a
local level there.
And what we have been able to do in the work group, as I
mention, is layer our authorities. So, in the case of vessels
that refused Coast Guard boarding in the Eastern Pacific in
August of 2022, working with partners in Treasury, in State,
and throughout the interagency, those were Chinese--the
beneficial ownership was to accompany PRC; they were Panamanian
flagged. And, after those incidents occurred, Panama actually
deflagged 31 vessels belonging to that same company. Those are
real, tangible, articulable outcomes that are only achieved
when we do work together in an interagency and take the issue
from detection to outcome.
We are not going to interdict or inspect our way out of the
IUU fishing challenge globally. So, it really does take a
focused effort synchronized in the interagency, alongside
international partners with the support of nongovernmental
organizations, which is what M-SAFE is doing.
And, to your question, sir, we are in year 3 of 5 of M-
SAFE. So, as you consider whether to reauthorize that
particular work group and whether to fund it so that this isn't
a collateral duty; we work hard to push other issues aside and
focus in this space so that we can assign individuals to focus
primarily on this challenge globally.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you. In regard to the
specific provision we worked on with Congressman Huffman, it
was about capacity building within DoD. Is that a tool that the
Coast Guard needs as well? Or I know you mentioned doing some
work with Senegal, for example. Is that an authorization or
capacity that the Coast Guard needs?
Admiral Burdian. Sir, I think we feel like we have the
authority, in particular, using State's authority to build
capacity, where we get those requests. Coast Guard crews have
been in [inaudible], Senegal, Vietnam, Panama, Ecuador, Costa
Rica. We really have deployed globally to understand the needs
of our partners and apply resources to help elevate the
capacity so that we are operating with our international
partners on that level playing field.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you. I yield back.
Dr. Babin [presiding]. The gentleman yields back.
I would like to recognize the gentleman from Massachusetts,
Mr. Auchincloss.
Mr. Auchincloss. Thank you, Chairman.
Good afternoon, Admiral Burdian, thank for being here. The
Coast Guard is facing a 3,000-person workforce shortage, which
will impact stations in Massachusetts, including Scituate,
Boston, and Cape Cod. How will the shortage impact the Coast
Guard's ability to conduct its missions? In Massachusetts, in
particular, I know you spoke previously broadly about how you
devolve operational risk to the commanders. Can you speak to
the Northeast, and Massachusetts, in particular?
Admiral Burdian. Yes, sir. Good afternoon. Those targeted
temporary reductions were made given the geographical layout of
those particular boat stations and our standards for search and
rescue, which is our priority during this time.
I will say I sort of owned the performance side of that as
my primary duty and have directed the offices of search and
rescue to continue to monitor the performance of search and
rescue in locations where there has been an impact due to the
personnel shortage to make sure that we are achieving the level
of service the American public expects.
Mr. Auchincloss. We don't have enough personnel. There are
effects happening to the stations. There is going to be a
diminution in service. So, what are the tradeoffs that you are
making? What are the tradeoffs that are you issuing to the
commanders at those stations that they are not going to do?
Admiral Burdian. Well, I think you've been briefed on what
the reductions are. Whether it is a forward operating location
or there will be a unit with scheduled missions only or
seasonal stations, we're ceasing to operate on the western
rivers----
Mr. Auchincloss [interrupting]. Yes, I mean, they are
activities, but I am talking about outcomes. What is the
diminution in outcomes and performance that the American public
can expect because of this personnel shortfall?
Admiral Burdian. So, the reductions were targeted given our
existing policy toward performance, toward outcomes. And I can
provide you more details on that----
Mr. Auchincloss [interrupting]. I----
Admiral Burdian [interposing]. OK.
Mr. Auchincloss. That is not what I am asking. You clearly
have a personnel target because you need that number of
personnel to execute your 11-part mission. If you don't have
enough personnel, unless you are overstaffed--I don't think
anyone here is claiming that you are--then there is going to be
a reduction in that inability to execute that mission. So, just
clearly state what are the tradeoffs that you are making across
that 11-part mission as it affects Massachusetts.
Admiral Burdian. Sure. Absolutely. Right, like we will
conduct fewer law enforcement boardings per se if there is--
right, like, we have limits on the amount of time an individual
boat driver can spend operating. Once those limits are reached,
because that individual crew is conducting a search and rescue
case, it will be unavailable for other missions.
Mr. Auchincloss. So, you are prioritizing search and
rescue, search and recovery, but there is going to be a
degradation in law enforcement in the three maritime law
enforcement missions.
Admiral Burdian. There could be. Sir, it is difficult
without knowing what that search and rescue load will be. This
is a demand-driven operation.
Mr. Auchincloss. I understand, you can't predict it. But,
overall, you know the trend lines for search and rescue demand
in the greater Boston area. So, of those three maritime
missions, fisheries, migrant interdiction, and drug
interdiction, which of those three are likely to be the biggest
challenge for the Northeast because of the reduction in law
enforcement?
Admiral Burdian. Well, certainly, in the law enforcement
space, it will be fisheries that are important. We don't do an
awful lot of the drug or migrant interdiction in the Northeast,
as you know, sir.
But I can tell you that our operational commanders are
empowered to make those tradeoffs at given----
Mr. Auchincloss [interrupting]. I know you are going to do
your best with the resources that you have. It is not a
question of your response. It's just the reality is that you
don't have enough people. And so, it is important just to
articulate the tradeoffs so that we here on the panel, but also
my constituents, can understand the imperative of the Coast
Guard mission and why it is important that we support you as
you recruit.
Admiral Burdian. Yes, sir.
Mr. Auchincloss. Ms. MacLeod, how would you evaluate the
Coast Guard's recruitment? What might they do to improve it?
Ms. MacLeod. We have seen in our various studies of the
Coast Guard workforce that the Coast Guard has a culture of
making do. They also have a process to assess their workforce
and manpower determinations. And this is an area where we do
have outstanding recommendations to the Coast Guard that they
do these assessments.
Mr. Auchincloss. You have 40 seconds. What is the one big
thing they can do better on recruitment?
Ms. MacLeod. Know the positions that they are trying to
fill.
Mr. Auchincloss. I don't understand. I am a former marine.
When we got recruited, we didn't know our MOS. What do you mean
by that? Say more.
Ms. MacLeod. Without having a strategy or a plan of how
many people and what missions they should be doing, I don't
know how you can make a recruitment pitch.
Mr. Auchincloss. OK. So, better planning around MOS
shortfalls and how to back plan.
Ms. MacLeod. Indeed.
Mr. Auchincloss. All right. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Dr. Babin. Thank you. The gentleman yields back.
I would like to recognize the gentlelady from Michigan, Ms.
Scholten.
Ms. Scholten. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you so much
to our witnesses for taking the time to be here today and your
informative testimony.
As the vice ranking member on the Coast Guard and Maritime
Transportation Subcommittee, I was fortunate enough in August
to join a congressional delegation to Panama with the Coast
Guard to learn more about the Coast Guard's key law enforcement
missions. As you know, the Coast Guard is uniquely positioned
to perform drug, migrant, and IUU interdictions. Intercepting
illicit drug shipments is an essential part of combating
addiction and maintaining public health and national security.
As your testimony here today has shown, we know you share my
concern over a potential Government shutdown in just 3 days and
what that would mean to our enforcement efforts.
Rear Admiral Burdian, we have previously heard how a
shutdown will harm our servicemembers, the heart of the Coast
Guard. But how would a Government shutdown impact the Coast
Guard's key operations, particularly drug, migrant, and IUU
interdictions?
Admiral Burdian. Congresswoman, first, thank you for taking
time to visit with the Coast Guard and understand our mission
space. We would continue to conduct lifesaving missions. We
would continue to keep assets on patrol. There would be certain
operations that we would not conduct during a shutdown.
But I will say the most profound impact is to our people,
to the individuals conducting that critical work. I was chief
of response in Seattle during the last Government shutdown, and
my spouse at the time was in command of a ship that was
deployed to the South Pacific. And so, kind of keeping your
head in the game is a real challenge when you have young people
who don't know how they are going to put food on their table
and make ends meet. So, if we look at the range of missions the
Coast Guard conducts and the relative risk in those mission
spaces, we often operate very close to the edge of the
operating envelope of the assets that we crew.
What I want as a leader and an operator is for our crews to
be able to focus on risk and the mission at hand.
Ms. Scholten. Thank you. And you may well be aware, in
April, Representative Gonzalez-Colon and I reintroduced H.R.
2693, the bipartisan Pay Our Coast Guard Parity Act of 2023.
This bill would ensure that, if servicemembers in other
branches of the military are paid, even in a Government
shutdown, so will our Coast Guard members. They deserve nothing
less. This bill is essential to ensure that Coasties may
continue to perform these critical law enforcement missions
without fear of losing their homes, feeding their families, or
risking their livelihoods.
Can you talk a little bit more indepth just specifically
about the impact of a shutdown, fearing where the income may be
coming from, has on retention and recruitment and the overall
morale of our Coasties.
Admiral Burdian. Yes, ma'am. I think what we don't want is
to be at our crewmembers' dinner tables, when crewmembers are
arguing at dinner tables about finances because they are not
receiving their paycheck as coastguardsmen and then are going
out to conduct dangerous missions. We say that service is a
sacrifice. And it's true, but it's not just a servicemember who
sacrifices. I can tell you that you my children have missed,
with either parent, multiple holidays, birthdays, significant
events. It really--it's a worthwhile tradeoff. But the more
junior the person, the more challenging it is, given the fact
that--most Coast Guard personnel are not--they don't live in a
place that is co-located with a large military base. So, we are
on the economy for housing. And it is having to have
discussions with landlords and creditors. It is demoralizing.
It is difficult, again, to keep your head in the game.
Ms. Scholten. Thank you for that. Thank you for your
service, and thank you for your sacrifice.
With that, I yield back.
Dr. Babin. The gentlelady yields back.
I would like to recognize the gentleman from California,
Mr. Huffman.
Mr. Huffman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And I want to thank my colleague from Louisiana who earlier
brought up our collaborative efforts on this subject, very
troubling subject of IUU fishing.
Thanks to those on the panel who testified about this, and
we could spend an entire hearing, of course, on this subject. I
hope we actually will. I hope a few other committees will do
the same because we now know a lot more about this because of
the recent bombshell report the Outlaw Ocean Project detailed
in The New Yorker, and it reveals a profoundly troubling
reality. We have seafood processed by Uyghur forced labor in
China, a lot of it, that has infiltrated U.S. supply chains. It
is a distressing revelation. We know that IUU fishing is a
sobering environmental problem. It is a fishing industry
problem. My colleague from Texas talked about how unfair it is
to the gulf shrimp fleet in his district. And it is the same
effect on U.S. fishers all over the country who hold themselves
to a high standard and have to compete with this terrible
illegal, unreported, and unregulated black market.
But it is also a huge human rights crisis that is seeping
through our borders. And this Outlaw Ocean Project links 47,000
metric tons of imported seafood, including cod, pollock,
shrimp, and more, to Uyghur forced labor facilities, and that's
coming into our market. Major U.S. retailers and food service
companies are implicated, and that includes Costco, Kroger,
Sysco, and others. The scale of this issue just paints a dire
picture of how complicit we are in these systemic failures to
ensure an ethical supply chain.
Our Government unknowingly spent over $200 million over the
last 5 years on seafood that has been tied to Uyghur forced
labor for public food programs here in this country. This is
staggering. It should be a wakeup call. This problem is huge.
We are deeply complicit as consumers and, frankly, as the
United States Federal Government. And we are allowing this to
happen because of the failures of oversight, the lack of
enforcement, and the unwitting participation even of our own
Government programs. So, all of this, I think, demands our
immediate attention and a much stronger collective commitment
to seriously confronting this scourge. Given what we have known
for years, we should have been doing this all along. But
certainly what we know now should be an outrage to everyone.
Now, some of us have been sounding the alarm for several
years. And, just in the last few weeks since the new report
dropped, Ranking Member Grijalva and I have sent two letters,
one to Customs and Border Protection and the other to the
Department of Commerce and NOAA. We are calling on the
administration to address this with a whole-of-Government
approach.
And, Rear Admiral Burdian, thank you for referencing your
belief that we need a whole-of-Government approach. Certainly,
any step back by any part of our Government on this issue right
now would be deeply troubling, such as what NOAA unfortunately
is doing today. They are announcing that they are delaying a
rulemaking that would strengthen the SIMP program and implement
IUU provisions that Congressman Graves and I helped to get into
the NDAA. This is a huge mistake. We are going in the wrong
direction at the worst possible time. This is not just a
fishing industry problem. Forced labor and illegal fishing are
inseparable. They go together. And it is not just about land
versus water, ship decks versus processing plants. Every part
of our supply chain is touched by this problem.
So, Rear Admiral Burdian, I just want to ask you about some
of the limitations of authority that you are probably grappling
with. Is it correct that the Coast Guard's authority to enforce
illegalities tied to IUU fishing only extends to activities
that happen at sea?
Admiral Burdian. Yes, sir, it is.
Mr. Huffman. And is it also true that the Coast Guard is
limited in its ability to enforce forced labor policies like
those identified in the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act and
the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act?
Admiral Burdian. Sir, our crews are trained to identify
signs of human trafficking and forced labor. But, as you
stated, that is not within our enforcement authority.
Mr. Huffman. Yes, and thank you also for--I just want to
agree with you when you say that you feel like we need more
interagency coordination to tackle this.
In the few seconds I have left, I will just ask our witness
from the GAO. This seems like a problem that we need some GAO
guidance on. Would you agree that a study that looks at
agencies pointing at each other, jurisdictional confusion, and
limitations would be of great value if the GAO would be willing
to undertake it?
Ms. MacLeod. I would agree with that. And I would point you
also to our May 2023 report, if you are not familiar with it,
where we emphasize that better information sharing between CBP
and the National Marine Fisheries Service could lead to better
targeting and investigation.
Mr. Huffman. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chair, I
yield back.
Dr. Babin. Yes, sir, thank you, and I appreciate the line
of questioning about the fishing. I think this concludes all
the questions that we have. Is there anyone else that--I don't
think there has been anyone coming into the room that hasn't
had an opportunity to ask questions.
Seeing none, this concludes our hearing for today. I would
like to thank each and every one of you witnesses for being
here today.
And, with that, this subcommittee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 12:16 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

Questions to Rear Admiral Jo-Ann F. Burdian, Assistant Commandant for
Response Policy (CG-5R), U.S. Coast Guard, from Hon. Mike Ezell

Question 1. The Coast Guard published an Unmanned Systems Strategic
Plan in March, including a strategic goal of identifying capability
gaps that could be closed using unmanned systems.
What progress is the Coast Guard making toward this goal? Can you
discuss specific examples?
Answer. The Coast Guard continuously evaluates its mission needs
and the capabilities needed to fulfill them. This strategic goal has
triggered the assessment of unmanned systems across multiple domains
(e.g., aviation, surface, subsurface) to evaluate their ability to fill
capability gaps.
Several ongoing mission and capability development efforts are
currently including the use of Unmanned Systems to fill gaps. First, as
existing platforms reach the end of their service life, the Coast Guard
is evaluating options to employ unmanned systems to maintain those
operational capabilities. Options include extending and expanding the
use of cutter-based unmanned aircraft systems and employing long-range
unmanned aircraft systems in place of manned fixed wing assets in the
future.
The Joint Persistent Wide Area Maritime Surveillance Capability
Analysis Report developed in collaboration between the Coast Guard,
Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement
identified new gaps in surveillance and detection within the US EEZ.
All three components are collaborating to develop concepts of operation
and asset operational requirements to close those gaps using a mix of
manned and unmanned systems for coastal surveillance and detection.

Question 2. Another goal is to spur innovation through testing
small, learning, and scaling smart. When it comes to integrating new
technologies, the challenge is not just in identifying and testing
them. There is also a need to either incorporate those capabilities
directly into the budget process or ensure that enough funding is
available with enough flexibility to quickly deploy them at scale.
Question 2.a. From a funding standpoint, how will the Coast Guard
be able to quickly scale the deployment of proven unmanned systems?
Answer. The Coast Guard has already awarded small-scale, limited
duration contracts to deploy unmanned systems and enabling technologies
in support of ongoing operations. These deployments often leverage
innovative contractor-owned/contractor-operated (COCO) unmanned systems
which can provide operational data-as-a-service quickly without the
time and investments needed for more traditional material acquisitions.
These small-scale COCO contracts have been and can continue to be
funded with existing operations and support funding to quickly fill
operational gaps within the current budget process. Further, these COCO
deployments avoid the timely and costly acquisition and ownership costs
of hardware systems, lifecycle maintenance, and logistics. These
deployments have already yielded lessons learned through real-world use
for current missions.
One example is Coast Guard contracts to deploy unmanned surface
vehicles (USVs) to directly support operations. Saildrone was awarded a
contract to provide surveillance and detection data directly to Coast
Guard operators while maintaining ownership and operating the USVs
throughout a four-month deployment in the Caribbean Sea. This contract
allowed rapid capability deployment, evaluation of these USVs for Coast
Guard missions, and development of potential operational concepts for
their deployment in conjunction with manned boats, ships, and aircraft
on a broader scale in the future.
Meanwhile the Coast Guard has leveraged Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) contracts and is developing guidance on how best to
employ the other transactional authorities (OTAs) granted in the
National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY 2023. Employment of
these vehicles allow more rapid procurement and acquisition of
innovative technologies including unmanned systems and other
technologies that support the use of unmanned systems (e.g., sensors,
communications networks, and data systems).
The Coast Guard will continue to pursue COCO contracts and
innovative contracting vehicles in the near term to enable
experimentation and learning about these systems and technologies and
determine which may be appropriate for future acquisition and
ownership. When those capabilities that are most effective and
affordable are determined, future funding sources will be evaluated
during the annual budget process.

Question 2.b. Additionally, another important strategic goal is to
``build and sustain partnerships across DHS, DoD, and other
stakeholders to leverage parallel efforts.'' How is the Coast Guard
pursuing that goal? Are there specific examples you can reference?
Answer. The Coast Guard is working closely with U.S. Department of
Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), and Other
Government Agencies (OGA) to deploy, test, evaluate, and share lessons
learned on new unmanned capabilities and supporting systems.
The Coast Guard leverages DHS initiatives for purchase and
coordination of unmanned systems advancements. First, the Coast Guard
leverages the DHS-wide Blanket Purchase Agreement for procurement of
small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) that are NDAA approved (BLUE
UAS). Second, the Coast Guard's current program for sUAS collaborates
with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and shares information on
training best practices, cooperative curriculum development, training
facility site visits, and information sharing regarding security
control mechanisms. Similar cyber discussions are held with other DHS
components as part of a bimonthly department-wide sUAS Cyber
roundtable. Finally, the Coast Guard is also part of a Joint Program
Office (JPO) with CBP Air and Marine Operations (CBP AMO). The JPO has
responsibility for the development of joint capabilities and
coordination of policies and operations to maximize the utility of
individual agency assets across present and future DHS UASs. The JPO is
responsible for management and employment of common UAS for CBP AMO and
the Coast Guard and provides synergies between the two organizations.
The Coast Guard has engaged heavily with DoD units including the
U.S. Navy (NAVAIR), U.S. Air Force (AFSOC), and the Defense Innovation
Unit (DIU) on sUAS to include obtaining cybersecurity ``Authorization
to Operate'' (ATO) and collaborating on creation of a new policy manual
for BLUE UAS specific-cybersecurity protocols. The Coast Guard also
collaborates with DoD in receiving airspace authorization from the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and use of UAS in the National
Airspace System for Coast Guard missions involving the use of long
range UAS like the MQ-9. Specifically, the Coast Guard has successfully
worked with NORTHCOM and the North Dakota and Michigan Air National
Guards to support search and rescue operations with DoD UAS and
continues to expand joint operations with more DoD units and in
additional geographical locations, including the Indo-Pacific. Further,
the Coast Guard coordinated with US Navy Task Force 59 (TF-59) in
Bahrain to learn from their deployment of unmanned systems and testing
of UAS operations from Coast Guard cutters supporting US Navy Fifth
Fleet. Similar collaboration and interservice UAS operations are
ongoing with the US Navy's Fourth Fleet in the SOUTHCOM area of
responsibility.
Finally, the Coast Guard is engaged with other government agencies.
For example, the Service is collaborating with NOAA to support mission-
based testing of UAS platforms for oil spill response, train NOAA
members for interagency knowledge sharing/awareness, and use NOAA
facilities for Coast Guard UAS qualification courses. Additionally, the
Coast Guard has implemented protocols created by the National Institute
of Standards and Technology, collaborated with the Environmental
Protection Agency regarding UAS program management best practices, and
worked extensively with the FAA to implement training on emergency
Special Government Interest approvals for safely and legally operating
UAS within controlled airspace for emergency response.

Question 3. While most of the focus on the Coast Guard's IUU
enforcement has been on high-seas--there is a very serious problem of
IUU fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. There have been countless illegal
incursions into our EEZ by small Mexican fishing boats targeting shrimp
and red snapper.
These illegally caught fish are then finding their way into the
U.S. market where they are competing unfairly and illegally with
product from our domestic fisherman. On top of this, they are severely
undermining the fishery management regime for which US shrimp and red
snapper fisheries will be held accountable.
Given the Coast Guard's presence in the Gulf of Mexico, why has
there not been a significant decline in these incursions?
Answer. While the Coast Guard routinely interdicts Mexican vessels
illegally fishing in the U.S. EEZ, the fishermen are repatriated to
Mexico. Akin to U.S. law, Mexican law only allows the issuance of civil
penalties for these offenses, which have not significantly deterred the
illegal activity.

Question 4. Recent reports have shown some Mexican Nationals have
been interdicted up to 40 times in our EEZ. Currently there are no laws
in place to deter this behavior.
What are the consequences once a Mexican fishing vessel is caught
illegally fishing in our EEZ?
Answer. The U.S. government seizes the catch, gear, and vessel, and
CBP repatriates the violator to Mexico. After developing case packages
documenting the incursion, those case packages are transmitted through
the State Department to the Mexican government to afford Mexico the
opportunity to hold their citizens accountable under their own laws.
According to Article 73 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of
the Sea, which the U.S. has not ratified but accepts as international
law, a foreign national's punishment for illegal fishing cannot include
imprisonment, despite significant recidivist behavior. U.S. law and
Mexican law only allow for civil penalties. The United States is
actively working with Mexico to see if there are other operational or
legal mechanisms that could be used to prevent multiple instances of
recidivism or incursions.

Questions to Rear Admiral Jo-Ann F. Burdian, Assistant Commandant for
Response Policy (CG-5R), U.S. Coast Guard, from Hon. Jared Huffman

Coast Guard inspections and forced labor
Rear Admiral Burdian, thank you for co-chairing the US Interagency
Working Group on IUU Fishing. Illegal, unreported, and unregulated
(IUU) fishing is depleting our oceans of fish, damaging marine
ecosystems, and enabling widespread human rights abuses and forced
labor on fishing vessels around the world. As stated in the Coast
Guard's IUU strategy, your agency is ``Leveraging existing resources,
enforcement tools, and legal authorities to coordinate efforts
alongside partner nations to combat IUU fishing and associated illegal
trade, including weapons, drugs, and human trafficking . . .''. I have
several questions regarding human trafficking and forced labor:
Question 1. When Coast Guard officers board vessels to inspect
them, and fishers on the vessels give notes to the officers requesting
assistance, what are Coast Guard officers instructed to do in response
to these requests for assistance?
Answer. Coast Guard boarding officers are instructed to pass the
information via their chain of command and facilitate a conversation
through the Global Maritime Operational Threat Response Coordination
Center to inform the interagency and coordinate further action among
interagency partners.

Question 2. When the Coast Guard conducts inspections for safety
and seaworthiness, is the Coast Guard also assessing the vessel
conditions for red flags for forced labor?
Answer. If Coast Guard boarding officers observe indications of
forced labor, they are instructed to pass the information via their
chain of command and facilitate a conversation through the Global
Maritime Operational Threat Response Coordination Center to inform the
interagency and coordinate further action.

Question 3. Has the Coast Guard ever found forced labor on a vessel
under inspection? What was the result? Has the Coast Guard ever
reported a forced labor case to another agency for prosecution/
investigation?
Answer. The Coast Guard has not encountered a case of forced labor
while conducting high seas boardings and inspections. Structurally,
there is not a protocol in place to report cases of forced labor, but
the Coast Guard is currently working with the Department of Labor's
Bureau of International Labor Affairs to include such a mechanism in
the Global Maritime Operational Threat Response system.

Question 4. Are Coast Guard officers trained on identifying forced
labor aboard vessels that they inspect? Is this part of the curriculum
at the Coast Guard Academy?
Answer. Prior to a counter IUU fishing patrol, Coast Guard units
will conduct specific training, which includes training on indicators
of forced labor. Forced labor identification is not a standard part of
the curriculum taught to Officers at the Coast Guard Academy. However,
we are collaborating with the Department of Labor's Bureau of
International Labor Affairs on a forced labor training, and have
received the International Labor Organization Handbook on Identifying
Forced Labor in Fishing. The Maritime Safe Act calls for strong
interagency collaboration drawing on respective agencies' expertise
including that of the U.S. Department of Labor.

Question 5. Advocates have suggested that one method to keep
fishers safe on vessels would be to mandate access to WiFi, allowing
the fishers to communicate with shore. What is your view of this
proposal to prevent forced labor? And, as a policy matter, how could
this be added to the requirements for vessels entering U.S. waters?
Answer. The Coast Guard has not taken a position regarding mandated
access to WiFi onboard fishing vessels. Such a requirement would
require further study and necessitate new regulations.
Importance of Automatic Information Systems (AIS) for transparency at
sea
Question 1. Rear Admiral Burdian, as you know, Automatic
Information System (AIS) is a vessel tracking system that transmits a
vessel's location, behavior, and identity. This technology was
developed to reduce vessel collisions, increase maritime safety, and
provide greater awareness of vessel locations at sea, improving domain
awareness. AIS transponders are relatively inexpensive for vessel
owners to purchase. Vessel operators can turn off their AIS
transponders, but that in itself is a suspicious act that can draw
attention to the vessel's activities.
Would greater use of AIS by fishing vessels around the world assist
the Coast Guard with effective law enforcement regarding IUU fishing in
your partnerships in the Pacific and around the world?
Answer. Automatic Information System (AIS) is a valuable Maritime
Domain Awareness (MDA) tool in combating IUU fishing; data from the
system is monitored and analyzed by Coast Guard intelligence units to
inform operational planning. Increased AIS usage and the legal
requirement of compliance with the International Convention for the
Safety of Life at Sea, Chapter V, Regulation 19.2 across the
international community would provide intelligence units with more
information to better identify potential IUU fishing. However, as a
tool designed primarily to aid in safe navigation, the susceptibility
of AIS information to spoofing or other forms of manipulation limit its
reliability as a stand-alone MDA tool for enforcement operations.
IUU in the Gulf of Guinea
Question 1. The Maritime SAFE Act required a National 5-Year
Strategy to Combat IUU fishing. The new strategy identifies three
strategic objectives: 1) Promote sustainable fisheries governance; 2)
Enhance monitoring, control, and surveillance of marine fishing
operations; and 3) Ensure only legal, sustainable, and responsibly
harvested seafood enters trade. It also identifies ``Priority Regions''
for counter-IUU fishing programming, including the Gulf of Guinea.
The Gulf of Guinea was identified because it has a high risk for
IUU fishing activity; there is entry of illegally caught seafood into
its markets; and the countries lack the capacity to fully address the
illegal activity. There has also been a significant increase of PRC
fishing, and PRC investment in fish meal plants and fish bases in the
Gulf of Guinea. All of these operations are depleting fish stocks,
undermining the local fishing economies and harming sustainable
fisheries management, leading to incidents of civil unrest due to food,
environmental and economic insecurity. Further there is an uptick of
young men and families getting on small boats to migrate to Europe.
Question 1.a. Is the Coast Guard undertaking activities to expand
and support capacity building activities with Gulf of Guinea partner
nations?
Answer. The Coast Guard employs the full scope of available
security cooperation activities within its own resource limitations and
authorities so that nations within this critical region may exercise
their sovereignty over their own exclusive economic zones (EEZ), with a
particular emphasis on support for countering IUU fishing. Current
capacity building efforts include: formal resident and mobile training;
capability and capacity assessments; joint exercises; subject matter
expert exchanges; and senior level key leader engagements. In
collaboration with the U. S. Navy, the Coast Guard established the
African Maritime Law Enforcement Partnership program in 2008, to build
the maritime response capacity of African partner nations through
training, exercises, and combined maritime law enforcement operations.
The Gulf of Guinea will see the second greatest number of Coast Guard
Mobile Training Team visits in Fiscal Year (FY) 2024, after only the
Indo-Pacific region. One specific engagement example is a joint Coast
Guard/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) led five-
day seminar on combatting IUU fishing, the next of which will occur in
Sierra Leone in July of 2024. The Coast Guard also actively partners
with interested Gulf of Guinea countries in providing Excess Defense
Article (EDA) vessels via the interagency allocation process. Recent
examples of Coast Guard EDA vessel transfers included two 87-foot
Marine Protector Class Coastal Patrol Boats to the Ghanaian Navy in
2023, which enabled them to patrol to the limit of their EEZ.

Question 1.b. What are you doing to counter IUU fishing by the PRC?
Answer. The Coast Guard seeks law enforcement action against the
beneficial owners and actors in IUU fishing, rather than targeting one
vessel, one fleet, or one flag state. The Coast Guard works with our
partners to increase collective international ocean governance through
the Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) for the
adoption of High Seas Boarding and Inspection Schemes. These schemes
allow party nations to ensure adherence to established Conservation
Management Measures of the RFMOs. Additionally, the Coast Guard works
with partner nations during law enforcement operations to encourage
adherence to international norms and rules-based order. This occurs
through deployments of Coast Guard cutters and law enforcement teams
around the world. Last fiscal year, the Coast Guard allocated
approximately 146 days of Deployable Specialized Force Units to AFRICOM
to serve as force multiplier in the region.

Question 1.c. Are you engaging in shiprider agreements, port
security and fisheries management trainings?
Answer. The Coast Guard leverages four bilateral maritime law
enforcement agreements with shiprider provisions in the West Africa/
Gulf of Guinea region: Sierra Leone, The Gambia, Senegal, and Cabo
Verde. Additionally, a bilateral maritime law enforcement agreement is
in effect with the Seychelles. It is anticipated the United States and
Cote d'Ivoire will enter into a bilateral maritime law enforcement
agreement in 2024.
In FY 2024, the Coast Guard International Port Security Program
(IPSP) is scheduled to provide port security capacity building in Cabo
Verde (two sessions), Cameroon (three sessions), Cote D'Ivoire (three
sessions), Guinea (three sessions), and Gabon. This training will focus
on improving our partners' implementation of the International Ship and
Port Facility Security Code at the national and facility level.
Through its IPSP, the Coast Guard conducts a variety of port
security engagements with Gulf of Guinea partner nations. In
collaboration with the U.S. Department of State and local government
authorities, IPSP conducts annual informal port security evaluations
and triennial formal assessments in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cote
d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Sao
Tome and Principe, Gabon, Republic of the Congo, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, and Angola. IPSP also conducts port security-
related capacity building in Guinea, Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, and
Gabon, and enhanced assistance programs in Benin, Nigeria, and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo. Capacity building and enhanced
assistance programs allow IPSP to provide targeted seminars and
technical assistance to host nation government officials and port
facility security officers to elevate port security standards and build
more effective port security governance and implementation systems.
