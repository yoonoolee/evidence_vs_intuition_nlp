QUALITY OF LIFE REVIEW PANEL--MEMBER DAY

House of Representatives,
Committee on Armed Services,
Quality of Life Panel,
Washington, DC, Thursday, February 6, 2024.
The committee met, pursuant to call, at 2:18 p.m., in room
2212, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Don Bacon (chairman
of the panel) presiding.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DON BACON, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM
NEBRASKA, CHAIRMAN, QUALITY OF LIFE PANEL

Mr. Bacon. Welcome, everybody.
I will apologize right up front. I lost my voice. A certain
other member of our panel lost his voice last week and I think
I caught it. So you know who I'm talking about.
[Laughter.]
Mr. Bacon. So something going around.
The hearing will now come to order. I ask unanimous consent
that the chair be authorized to declare a recess at any time. I
think we're safe now.
I ask unanimous consent to include in the record testimony
from Mike Garcia involving a pay raise. So without objection,
so ordered.
Mr. Bacon. Okay. Let me welcome everyone to this Quality of
Life Panel. I want to thank our colleagues for providing
testimony. I appreciate you both. We may have a third member
here soon.
I look forward to hearing your perspective on the issues
this panel has been chartered to consider. Service members and
their families making untold sacrifices to protect this nation.
I'm looking at two veterans, speaking of two and a third
one's another veteran and I am one, too. So we know we're--we
have our hearts on this.
They should not have to sacrifice or be concerned with
their basic necessities such as food, living conditions, access
to health care, basic quality of life due to their military
service.
These men and women deserve better. Over the past six
months this panel has heard from military spouses regarding the
struggles of obtaining childcare and maintaining employment due
to multiple military moves.
We have heard from the Government Accountability Office
about the abhorrent condition of unaccompanied housing. We
talked to military compensation experts about the adequacy of
junior enlisted pay.
Throughout these events we found that although the
department has done some work to improve service members'
quality of life, significant gaps remain.
As the panel begins to consider legislative recommendations
for the House Armed Services Committee and the Military
Personnel Subcommittee, I very much look forward to hearing
from our colleagues about concerns they're hearing from their
constituents.
I want to welcome our witnesses. We've got Representative
Derrick Van Orden, also Representative Mike Garcia, and
hopefully soon Representative Salud Carbajal. Before we go
further I'd like to allow Ranking Member Houlahan a few minutes
to deliver her opening remarks.

STATEMENT OF HON. CHRISSY HOULAHAN, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM
PENNSYLVANIA, RANKING MEMBER, QUALITY OF LIFE PANEL

Ms. Houlahan. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Since last June this bipartisan panel has diligently
engaged with service members, with spouses, advocacy groups,
the Department of Defense officials and leaders across our
military services on ways to improve pay and compensation,
housing, childcare, spouse employment, and health care.
By taking time to listen to these various stakeholders we
have identified best practices as well as gaps in how the
department and the services are meeting the needs of service
members and their families.
This hearing affords us a chance to hear from our own
colleagues who will share with us how their experiences and
their constituents' experiences have shaped what they see as
opportunities to improve the quality of life of those who
currently serve us today.
As the panel develops its recommendations we will take into
account the very true adage that we recruit the service member
but we retain the family, and it is the quality of life issues
that are often the deciding factor when somebody is either
considering joining the military service or remaining on active
duty.
Lastly, I do want to thank my colleagues on the panel who
have been very engaged in all of our briefings and hearings as
well as the panel's chair Mr. Bacon, again, for encouraging
such bipartisanship throughout this entire process.
Thank you. I yield back.
Mr. Bacon. Thank you, Ms. Houlahan, and your voice is
sharper than mine. I'll give you that.
This has been a bipartisan effort. It's been a great team
trying to solve the needs for our men and women in the military
and their families.
So with that I'd like to recognize Representative Van Orden
for five minutes, otherwise known as DVO. Fire away.

STATEMENT OF HON. DERRICK VAN ORDEN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF WISCONSIN

Mr. Van Orden. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I'd like to personally thank you for losing your voice.
That was Mike.
Hey, I appreciate very much coming here to be able to speak
about something that's near and dear to my heart, the lack of
appropriate compensation for our enlisted folks.
However, I want to preface all these comments with this
and, unfortunately, due to the lack of leadership of the Biden
administration and the Department of Defense we're experiencing
a crisis in confidence from those willing to join the all-
volunteer force.
After witnessing the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan
where I have two combat deployments and a projection of
strategic weakness which has led the world to become a much
more dangerous place, I am concerned that even if this Congress
does authorize a pay raise for the men and women commensurate
with their sacrifice, the morale, recruiting levels, quality of
life, and the quality of life of our service members will not
return until we have a strong leadership back in the executive
branch meaning a competent Commander-in-Chief.
I'm a 26-year veteran of the United States Navy. Over 22 of
those I served as a Navy SEAL. I spent approximately 16 years
of my marriage away from home in training and combat.
I've had over 50 of my friends killed in combat and as of--
with Mike Day. I've had 21 of my friends commit suicide, and
I'm coming here to testify for those that can't speak and for
our junior enlisted.
I was literally being shot at by various terrorist
organizations as my wife was standing in a checkout line in a
grocery store handing people coupons for WIC to get milk and
cheese to feed my children and I just think you cannot square
that circle.
Our men and women are sacrificing their time, something you
never get back, some their lives, and our families are living
below the poverty line and that's not okay. We spend trillions
of dollars on everything you can possibly imagine and we forget
that nothing works without the person.
This conversation on our military compensation and benefits
is critical because we are facing recruiting challenges with an
all-voluntary force. I want to highlight some stuff for you
just to put this into perspective for people who do not have
experience with the military.
Our junior enlisted--that's the E1 to E4--on average, if
you did an hourly salary for them, excuse me, it'd be about $11
an hour. Let's juxtapose that with working at Kwik Trip, which
is essentially a Midwestern 7/11. It's headquartered in my
district.
You start at Kwik Trip at $15-plus an hour, you have full
medical coverage including clinics that they run, and you have
a 401K plan. At Trane Technologies they'll pay for your
training at a technical college.
You're going to start at about $23 an hour with full
benefits, and those job skills that train they translate into
something that you can take anywhere with you.
Unlike killing terrorists, you know, that's a pretty
focused line of work and hopefully you're only doing that as a
member of the government.
So these people are getting this training and compensation
and they can move around the country at will. They don't have
to leave their families, they don't have to worry about getting
shot at, and they sure as hell don't have to worry about their
wife standing in line at a checkout stand handing in WIC
coupons.
So this has just got to stop. The number-one SOF maxim is
men are more important than machines. Humans are more important
than hardware.
And I'm asking you humbly, understanding that there are men
and women today who are standing with a weapon in their hand
and they are wearing body armor and they are protecting us from
the savages that live around the world that want to see us dead
simply because we're Americans.
So, again, I'm imploring you take this as seriously as you
and assert yourself and right this very easily correctable
wrong.
Again, I want to thank you very much for your bipartisan
work on this matter. I'd ask that God bless you and your
families. God bless the United States of America and our troops
that are watching over us as we sleep.
With that I yield back, sir.
Mr. Bacon. Thank you, Mr. Van Orden--Derrick.
Before I recognize Mike Garcia I want you to know we do
take this serious. I know this is a number-one issue that we
got to adjust compensation for our junior enlisted. So thank
you. You're reaffirming why it's so important and I'm grateful.
Mr. Van Orden. Mr. Chairman and the rest of the committee,
I just want to thank you and Ranking Member. I know you're
taking this seriously. I wouldn't be here if I thought I was
wasting my time, and if there's any way I can ever help you at
all I'm at your disposal.
Mr. Bacon. We appreciate your testimony.
With that, Mr. Garcia is recognized for five minutes.

STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE GARCIA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

Mr. Garcia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I realize--it's not lost on me that everyone in this room
today is a veteran. Thank you for your all service.
I also want to commend my friend Salud Carbajal who despite
being the last one to show up to this hearing today is a good
Marine, and he and I actually wrote together the Spouse
Licensing Relief Act that was actually signed into law by
President Biden last January--January of '23.
This gives wives of active duty members, husbands of active
duty members, reciprocity across state lines for their
professional licenses. So it shows that if we come together to
solve these problems, especially for our enlisted troops, as a
bipartisan organization we can actually get it done and the two
of us are very proud of that legislation.
Thank you for your commitment to have these conversations
on pay. As a former division officer, as a former combat naval
aviator in charge of 50 to 60 enlisted troops--sailors--aboard
my squadron and my aircraft carrier this is something I saw
firsthand.
I saw my sailors--a third of them--qualify for food stamps,
a third of them below the poverty line, and I want to echo the
sentiment that the most important weapon system in our
inventory DoD wide are our people and especially our junior
enlisted, the E1 through E6. So this is why I have written
these compensation bills to adjust pay for our junior enlisted,
the E1s through E6.
I know this panel has been waiting for the QRMC--the
Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation--studies to come
back. That has, I think, an interim review that's come back and
it's validating some of this.
So I want to talk about the bills that I've written in the
past as well as the language that I wrote in the House
Appropriations Committee for Defense Subcommittee that will be
coming up here on a vote here shortly.
To put things in perspective, the starting salary for a
junior enlisted is about $12 an hour. In California a starting
salary for an In-n-Out worker is about $20 to $22 an hour.
So adjusting the pay table so that the floor starts at $15
an hour, which is what my HACD language does, with a $2,600 a
month salary for an E1 puts them about $15 an hour. It's still
not enough, in my opinion. We can't do too much for our junior
enlisted troops.
Inflation over the last three years is 19.3 percent
cumulative. The pay raise that we have given our troops in the
NDAA and appropriated through the approps process sums up to
16.4 percent. So as legislators we have actually aggravated the
deficit problem in the households of our junior enlisted by
about 3 percent. So we're moving in the wrong direction.
It takes three promotions, as you can tell on the tables
behind me here on this side--it's not until you are basically
promoted three times and serve more than four years do you
actually get to the salary of a fast food worker at $15 an hour
with the FY23 pay table.
In 2021 I testified in front of the services and on HACD
and I was told there was no recruitment and retention problem.
I was appalled that they made that assertion. But the Army
missed recruiting by 14,000, the Navy 7,000, the Air Force
3,000, and all combined with reserves we missed our recruiting
numbers by 40,000.
So my text in the HACD bill, which is coming up on a vote
here very shortly, is effectively this pay table behind me--
taking this pay table from here starting at $1,900 a month for
an E1 to here, starting at $2,600 a month for an E1, and it
raises the pay raise up all the way through E6 and you can see
E6 above eight years ends up at the same spot.
So we are raising the floor, compressing the pay table. I
personally wrote this so that I know that there's no pay
inversion. There is compression, but I think that the enlisted
will be okay with that as long as they are getting paid these
higher levels.
A good friend of mine, Captain Chris Wilson, wrote an op-ed
that talks about the fact that actually this gets worse for
their troops when they go on deployment. When they go on
deployment they actually lose some of their food subsidies.
Captain Chris Wilson, U.S. Army, he's commander of Bravo
Company 12th Infantry Second Brigade and he's in charge of 139
soldiers and he says that basically when we go on deployment we
actually--our junior enlisted actually make less because we
lose some of our meal stipends.
Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy Honea, who I would
never argue with, says pay and compensation reform is going to
be one of those big problems that we need to start today.
The only thing I would say he's wrong about is that we
should have started yesterday, two years ago, three years ago,
before we had this retention problem, and I think focusing on
the pay is one of the facets that you all are chartered to look
at.
But raising the floor on this base pay is absolutely
essential and I, you know, would like the board members to read
the text that I have in the HACD bill. It's sitting in front of
you. It's got the pay table that I rewrote. I am helping you by
literally creating the document that hopefully the Pentagon can
adopt.
As an appropriator who sits on HACD I will do everything to
make sure that we get the money to support the adoption of that
pay table and I'll end with this, that the utilization of
bonuses are not bad things but they are not the cure all.
We should allow the bonuses to continue to be used to
address shortfalls in certain communities or to incentivize
people to recruit and to stay in certain communities, certain
MOSes.
But bonuses alone will fail and we can't afford to pay that
amount of the bill that would come with a bonus. So on behalf
of the 750,000 junior enlisted folks that would be affected by
this pay raise that I've written I am imploring you, I'm
begging you, to adopt it into the next year's NDAA.
I know it was in last year's NDAA before it went to
conference. I appreciate that. We're going to try to get it in
the HACD bill.
But these folks deserve to be above the poverty line. They
deserve to be off food stamps and there's not enough that we
can pay them. But happy to answer any questions.
And by the way, I'm not claiming I have the 100 percent
right answer with these pay tables but I think I'm in the right
coordinate system and combined with other housing and other
things you guys are looking at I think we can get to a good
solution for especially our junior enlisted.
So thank you for the opportunity. I yield.
Mr. Bacon. Thank you, Congressman Garcia.
And I got to tell you, it was very well thought out. I
appreciate the--all the brain bites that went into those. So
we're going to give it a good review and I think we're going
down--somewhat down this path. So I really like what you're
doing.
Mr. Garcia. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Bacon. With that, my friend Congressman Carbajal. You
are recognized.

STATEMENT OF HON. SALUD CARBAJAL, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

Mr. Carbajal. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I appreciate the
good work that Representative Garcia is doing on this issue.
I was a little bit late because I thought I'd give the Air
Force and the Navy a win for a change being that the Marine
Corps is usually on top of things.
With that, let me just say that a lot has been raised about
the regrettable situation of many of our enlisted that have to
resort to our safety net programs--WIC and other type of
programs like that.
But it also reminds us that those programs are so important
to keep going and that we pass and must move forward for that
circumstance where until we fix this pay scale we need to make
sure that we continue to provide that safety net for all food
insecure Americans.
Thank you, Chairman Bacon and Ranking Member Houlahan and
the rest of the task force subcommittee for holding this
hearing today. I commend you all for your leadership and work
as part of this panel since its creation and I look forward to
the recommendations that will come from it.
I'm a proud Marine, an enlisted Marine, having served eight
years in the reserves. This is my eighth year serving in
Congress and on the Armed Services Committee, which has given
me a great perspective on the great things and good things that
DoD does for the quality of life of our service members but
also in the areas where we need to address.
When I think about how to improve the quality of life of
our service members two things come to mind: pay differential
between enlisted and officers and childcare access and
affordability.
I know my good friend and chairman of this panel Mr. Bacon,
along with Representative Garcia who just spoke, are already
working on this important first issue so I will only touch on
it slightly.
The pay gap between enlisted and officers is concerning,
especially for junior enlisted. I know this committee has
worked hard to deliver pay increases in the last few years but
we need to do more for junior enlisted.
In your report to the Military Personnel Subcommittee I
urge you to prioritize this disparity. Without any actions on
it we will continue to struggle as a nation to meet recruiting
goals and potentially create retention problems or, should I
say, exacerbate retention problems.
Nationwide, there are a lack of childcare options and costs
are unaffordable and wait lists are months long. This is
negatively impacting our service members not just in the day-
to-day productivity but also their morale as we heard it from
senior enlisted leaders last week.
Part of the affordability issue is directly related to the
pay issue I just discussed. However, that is not the only
concern. We need DoD to act more swiftly on this growing issue.
For example, DoD is working to increase staff recruitment
and retention for child care development centers. As a way to
improve recruitment and retention at CDCs in the fiscal year
2023 NDAA Congress gave the DOD the authority to discount fees
for civilian child care development center employees whose
children are enrolled.
Under this authority DoD could offer discounts of up to 100
percent. But as of this year the military departments are still
in the process of establishing policies and implementing the
childcare employee discount program.
The House-passed fiscal year 2024 NDAA included a provision
that would have required the DoD to implement this 100 percent
discount but was taken out during conference negotiations.
This should signal to the DoD that this is an issue
Congress is paying attention to. Military families should not
need to worry how they are going to find or afford childcare.
In this panel report--in this panel's report I encourage
imploring the DoD to use their existing authorities to
alleviate this issue and to work with Congress where they need
new authorities or funding. Quality of life issues are not just
morale issues. They're also recruitment issues, readiness
issues, and retention issues. Without addressing them all we
will struggle with recruitment and retention.
I thank you for this opportunity to testify and look
forward to any questions you might have.
Mr. Bacon. Thank you, Congressman Carbajal. I think we're
making some progress on childcare. We have got more work to do.
Going by memory I think we have gone from 65 percent
manning to about 83 percent manning. But we got--we have to--
and they've done this by making it more competitive to work on
base.
So we're very competitive with the off base facilities. But
we have some ideas on this panel how we can further attract
more workers who are going to incorporate this in the plan.
So I want to thank you for your comments.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you. My name was misspelled so I hope
that doesn't bode well for the product that's going to come out
of this wonderful committee.
Mr. Bacon. On your name tag?
Oh, I thought--I thought maybe I just didn't know all this
time.
So I appreciate both of your testimony. Very much needed.
I'm just going to yield to the ranking member and see if you
have any questions.
Ms. Houlahan. No, I don't have any questions other than to
concur with you guys in terms of where our priorities ought to
be. Whether it's with pay or benefits or the focus on the
family I think those are all things that would have certainly
affected my choices when I was a young officer and certainly
would affect the choices of everybody who's active duty today.
So thank you for sharing with us.
Mr. Bacon. Thank you.
One thing we have learned, 18 years ago the pay scales were
right sized and since that we have been doing across the board
pay raises, which over time means the junior enlisted and the
senior that pay grows farther apart. I do think it's time that
we fix that. So that gets to both of your comments.
Mr. Garcia. Mr. Chairman, if I may.
Mr. Bacon. Yes?
Mr. Garcia. The pay raise in the NDAA, just to put that
comment in perspective, for an E1/E2 the last NDAA I forget the
percentage, 6 something, 7 something, comes out to about $75 a
month after taxes.
So that--to put that point in perspective, the officers are
certainly getting a bigger chunk of change but the junior
enlisted are getting effectively another bag of gas if they're
stationed in California that--you know, so it's really--the
disparity there is real. So appreciate you making that
observation.
Mr. Bacon. I want to thank some of our senior enlisted
leaders who brought this to our attention about a year ago and
they explained it just the way you all did. So our senior
enlisted leadership of our services are looking out for the
troops and I'm grateful to them.
So I'm going to close but, Chrissy, do you have anything
you want to add?
Ms. Houlahan. No. I yield back to you.
Mr. Bacon. So service members need and deserve these basic
quality of life issues to be addressed so they can focus solely
on their mission.
I want to thank each of our witnesses for their
perspective, valuable insights. I look forward to working in a
bipartisan manner to address these challenges and we will.
Thanks.
