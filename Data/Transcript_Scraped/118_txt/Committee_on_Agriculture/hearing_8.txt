Prepared Statement of Hon. Max L. Miller, a Representative in Congress
from Ohio
Federal regulations have a direct impact on Ohio farmers and
ranchers and those throughout country. With a commitment by U.S. famers
to ensure access to sound conservation practices and preservation of
natural resources for future generations, many overreach actions by the
U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have caused instability,
impacting our ability to viably produce food for our nation.
This is seen in a host of EPA regulations including Waters of the
U.S. (WOTUS) Rule, National Ambient Air Quality Standards for
Particulate Matter, Endangered Species Act and others, for which I have
heard concerns first-hand from Ohio farmers.
The President recently vetoed a bipartisan/bicameral Congressional
Resolution of Disapproval on the WOTUS Rule, which I cosponsored. The
Administration's rule provides an unworkable test for jurisdiction of
when the federal government regulates farms and ranchers, and creates
uncertainty for agriculture as they work to sustain vital conservation
resources.
Two District Courts have now acknowledged the new rule likely
oversteps EPA's authority under the Clean Water Act. With the rule now
on hold in more than half the country--including in my home state of
Ohio, EPA and the U.S. Army Corps should do the right thing by
listening to our legitimate concerns and rewriting the rule. Farmers
and ranchers in the remaining states are left with no clear way to
determine where federal jurisdiction begins and ends on their own
property.
Clean water is important to all of us and farmers and ranchers
certainly share the goal of caring for our natural resources--we depend
on them for our livelihoods--all we're asking for is a sensible rule
that farmers can interpret without hiring a team of lawyers.
I have also heard strong concerns from producers in my state
regarding reconsideration of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards
for Particulate Matter Rule. Recently the Ohio Farm Bureau joined the
American Farm Bureau Federation in comments on this proposed rule
noting, ``We are all for clean air and believe the environment is in
better shape than it was 50 years ago, but we must also balance
additional regulation and its impacts on our industries and
communities.''
Their comments stated, ``EPA's reconsideration of the 2020 fine
particles (PM
2.5
) standard comes at a time of ongoing
improvements to air quality and the regulated community have
successfully worked together to reduce emissions, resulting in a 37%
improvement in related air quality since 2000.''
Furthermore, Ohio farmers also weighed in regarding EPA's
Endangered Species Act (ESA) Workplan Update: Nontarget Species
Mitigation for Registration Review and Other FIFRA Actions. This
followed EPA actions in early 2021 to abruptly remove access to
critical crop protection tools--in the midst of planting season, with
no alternatives available--only to be restored access months later
causing major disruptions in crop plantings in my state and further
complicating the food supply chain.
The following actions were encouraged in the ESA rule to provide
clarity and certainty:

Enhance Farmer Input in Considering Mitigation Measure
Flexibility

Deepen Collaboration and Consultation with Relevant Agencies

Emphasize Voluntary Language in Pollinator Provisions

Improve Timeline for Label Restriction Notifications

Farm and ranch families manage and steward our natural resources
while supplying the world with a safe and abundant food supply. EPA
must carry out its role to review pesticide registrations in a timely
and transparent manner based on sound scientific criteria, as well as
addressing the historical challenges in its ability to carry out those
statutory obligations under the ESA and the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act.
I am heartened by efforts such as the Ohio Agriculture Conservation
Initiative (OACI), a partnership in my state between agriculture,
conservation, environmental and research communities to recognize
farmers for their dedication to advancing methods that improve water
quality in Ohio and increasing the number of farm best management
practices.
Agriculture producers in my congressional district are also taking
important steps toward stewardship of our natural resources. This
includes recognition of Wayne County Soil and Water Conservation
District (SEWCD) Conservation Farm Award winners for key environmental
conservation practices such as crop rotations, mulch tillage, strip
cropping, subsurface drainage and grassed waterways, as well as dairy
comprehensive nutrient management plans.
Furthermore, H2Ohio is a comprehensive water quality initiative
that is working to strategically address serious water issues impacting
my state through the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Ohio
Department of Agriculture and Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.
Additionally, we must recognize the important significance of
safeguarding our water supply in the aftermath of the East Palestine
train derailment impacting Ohio's citizens.
Farmers commitment to the preservation of natural resources and
maintaining the land for future generations must be fostered. I look
forward to working through the Farm Bill process to ensure access to
sound conservation practices well as more broadly in Congress to
address regulatory challenges in agriculture and rural communities.
