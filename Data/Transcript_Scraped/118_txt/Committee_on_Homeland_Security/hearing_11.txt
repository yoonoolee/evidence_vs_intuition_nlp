CENSORSHIP LAUNDERING: HOW THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY
ENABLES THE SILENCING OF DISSENT

----------

Thursday, May 11, 2023

U.S. House of Representatives,
Committee on Homeland Security,
Subcommittee on Oversight, Investigations,
and Accountability,
Washington, DC.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:02 p.m., in
room 310, Cannon House Office Building, Hon. Dan Bishop
(Chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Present: Representatives Bishop of North Carolina, Greene,
Ezell, Strong, Crane, Ivey, Thanedar, Ramirez, and Clarke.
Mr. Bishop. The Committee on Homeland Security,
Subcommittee on Oversight, Investigations, and Accountability,
will come to order.
Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare the
committee in recess at any point.
The purpose of this hearing is to receive testimony from an
expert panel that will outline how the Government-sponsored
censorship laundering enterprise operates, the price the
American people are paying for the Department of Homeland
Security's role in the censorship laundering enterprise, and
the legal and Constitutional implications of the Department's
role in censoring American voices.
I now recognize myself for an opening statement.
Good afternoon. Welcome to the Subcommittee on Oversight,
Investigations, and Accountability's hearing titled
``Censorship Laundering: How the U.S. Department of Homeland
Security Enables the Silencing of Dissent.''
Today's hearing will examine the Department of Homeland
Security's role as the nerve center of the Government scheme to
censor the on-line voices of millions of Americans, laundering
its efforts through a veil of ostensibly independent
nongovernmental organizations.
Freedom of speech and open debate are essential features of
a free society. Efforts to censor public discourse under the
guise of countering misinformation, disinformation, and
malinformation threaten this fundamental right.
To clarify, no one would argue or is arguing that hacking
voting machines or posting incorrect voting locations to
prevent people from voting would ever be acceptable.
This committee recognizes that CISA has a monumental task
and supports CISA's critical mission to secure our Federal
networks and critical infrastructure.
But as our witnesses today will attest, CISA has deviated
from this core mission and risks losing the trust of Congress,
the American people, and its vital private-sector partners.
What was initially a limited effort to counter foreign
disinformation on elections metastasized into a sprawling
effort that directly or indirectly censors Americans' discourse
and debate that are the hallmark of our democracy.
In 2018, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency, CISA, was charged with protecting election
infrastructure, which CISA decided unilaterally included
countering election misinformation from foreign malign actors.
By the 2020 election, mission creep found CISA pivoting
away from foreign sources to focus on domestic
``misinformation.'' But the Government knew this would raise
huge Constitutional concerns, so it helped create non-
Governmental entities, such as the Election Integrity Project,
to do for the Government what the Government could not do on
its own--and they knew it.
Listen to the head of the EIP.
[Video of Alex Stamos, director, Stanford Internet
Observatory, Cyber Policy Center, shown:]

Mr. Stamos. This is not because CISA didn't care about disinformation,
but at the time they lacked both kind-of the funding and the legal
authorizations to go do the kinds of work that would be necessary to
truly understand how election disinformation was operating.
So because of the feedback and the ideas from this group, we were able
to pull together pretty quickly a project between these four different
institutions to try to fill the gap of the things that the Government
could not do themselves.

[End of video.]
Mr. Bishop. So Government supported and funded NGO's to try
to fill the gap of the things the Government could not do
themselves. That is just incredible.
In a matter of a few months, CISA helped set up this
censorship infrastructure. CISA acted as a switchboard, to use
their words, to flag what they called misinformation and notify
social media platforms, who could--independently, they say--
decide whether to remove or modify the content.
All told, according to one source, during the 2020 election
this scheme resulted in 859 million tweets collected for
misinformation analysis, 22 million tweets and retweets
categorized as misinformation subject to censorship, 21 Twitter
users--Americans, domestic sources--identified and stigmatized
as, ``the most prominent repeat spreaders of disinformation,''
all of whom--perhaps coincidentally--were on the political
right.
It's not just for elections. The same network, using the
same tools, censored dozens of purportedly false COVID-19
narratives, many of which have subsequently been acknowledged
as being true.
So where is this headed? What is stopping DHS from
overreaching its jurisdiction again to censor more Americans on
whatever it deems critical infrastructure? In fact, who can say
that it's not being done right now?
We know DHS wants to expand this activity. Just last year,
they tried and then retreated under ridicule from creating a
Disinformation Governance Board. DHS documents suggest that
CISA wants to target issues as wide-ranging as racial justice,
the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, the war in Ukraine, and
financial markets.
The current CISA director has given us a clue as to what
the ultimate goal might be. Listen to her.
[Video of Jen Easterly, director, Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency, shown:]

Ms. Easterly. If you think about it, you know, our mission is critical
infrastructure. The most important critical infrastructure--excuse me,
critical infrastructure there is, is our cognitive infrastructure. And
so building that resilience is, you know, part of the mission set, in
my view.

[End of video.]
Mr. Bishop. George Orwell called and he wants his dystopian
future back.
I'm gravely concerned with CISA's efforts in this space.
How on Earth was this censorship laundering enterprise allowed
to metastasize? Where are the civil liberties protectors within
DHS and what are they doing?
It is obvious that there has been an abject failure of
leadership within DHS to allow this expanded role of this
nature to occur.
This scheme of censorship by proxy represents an attempt by
the Government to accomplish, indirectly and in secret, what it
would not have the power to do openly. It should give all
Americans who care about civil liberties, who care about
freedom of speech and association, great pause.
I look forward to the testimony today. I thank you all for
joining us.

today.

Mr. Bishop. I now recognize the Ranking Member, the
gentleman from Maryland, Mr. Ivey, for his opening statement.
Mr. Ivey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I welcome all the witnesses. Good afternoon.
I'd like to take a moment to express my condolences for the
families of the 8 people who were killed and at least 10 who
were injured when an SUV deliberately slammed into a crowd at a
city bus stop near a shelter for migrants in Brownsville,
Texas.
I would also like to acknowledge the tragic act of targeted
violence at an outlet mall that left 8 people dead, including 3
children and 7 injured in Allen, Texas.
Texas is 1 of 2 states in the United States that have seen
17 mass shootings so far this year.
I want to say with respect to this hearing, I had initially
thought that the focus of the hearing would be on--because it
is the Homeland Security Committee--dealing with false
information, misinformation, disinformation that is aimed at--
frequently by foreign parties, but not solely, we have domestic
issues as well--disinformation and false information that is
aimed at undermining the United States and creating additional
problems for the United States to be used against us.
Some of that is domestic. Certainly, with respect to
President Trump and the election denial issues, I thought that
that might be the kind of thing we would talk about, since it
represented a fundamental threat to democracy. It's still on-
going, I guess, as we saw on CNN last night. He's still saying
that he won the election.
But from the information standpoint, the lead-up to the
election was the President at the time and many of his
representatives in the White House and colleagues in the
Republican Party saying basically that if he lost the election
it would be because it was stolen.
Then we know that, based on the investigation that's been
going on in Georgia and other places, that he called the
Georgia secretary of state, Mr. Raffensperger, and pressured
him to find, quote/unquote, find 11,780 votes so he could claim
victory.
We have other variations of that too. We've got even people
here in Congress who can't bring themselves to admit that
President Trump didn't win the election even though there are
courts in those States that have already declared that there
was no fraud or theft of the election in those States.
We have on-going variations of that, for example, in
Arizona. I guess Ms. Lake is still saying that the election was
stolen from her even though that it's clear, according to the
officials in the State, that that was not the case.
Also, I thought that we might take a look at other issues
of misinformation and disinformation. For example, this
committee has heard frequent testimony about the issues of the
Sinaloa Cartel using misinformation, disinformation, false
information with respect to the United States and with respect
to migrants who might want to come to the United States, to
trick them into thinking that they can come here and find work
easily or whatever in order to bring them to the country.
Then frequently, my colleagues suggest, that they use them
as then mules to bring drugs into the country, and then also
might use them--and we're aware of this as well--to trap them
in work or sexual prostitution and other activities. But
they're using misinformation and disinformation to encourage
them to come.
One of the things that DHS has been, I think, trying to
figure out how to do correctly and more extensively is to get
the message out to those people in those countries that they
shouldn't come to the United States; in other words, to fight
against the disinformation that the cartel is pushing.
We have examples in the United States. We can go through
the active shooter mass killing scenarios at some point if we
want. But many of these are lone-wolf individuals who have been
hopefully tricked, but maybe that's just the way they viewed
it, into believing that they should follow principles of Nazism
or white supremacy or other lines like that.
That leads them to become active shooters. Usually they act
alone, they're lone wolves. But I think frequently we've seen
in the aftermath of these killings the statements they make on-
line about their beliefs, and many of them, especially those
who have been drawn into terrorism, the information that
they've got that persuaded them to become involved in terrorism
in the United States. And that we need to try and find ways to
address that in the United States so we can quell that effort
to turn people against us in our own country.
Then we have, with respect to the January 6 rioters, we've
got on-going misinformation and false information about these
people being peaceful protesters or tourists even, even though
I think it's clear--I think they've got 650 people-plus have
been convicted of breaking the law on that day, some as serious
as seditious conspiracy.
We've got domestic groups like the Oath Keepers and the
Proud Boys, who actually they just were convicted a few days
ago and were spewing this kind of misinformation as well.
Clearly, it creates a domestic threat to us that I thought we
could take a look at from the standpoint of misinformation and
disinformation.
Then there was Russia, and with respect to their thinking
about it. As they were preparing to invade Ukraine, they tried
to do false flag information and information that was
misleading, I think in an effort primarily to try and shatter
the NATO coalition. And we took steps.
I thought the Biden administration handled that well,
especially by doing preemptive releases of information that we
gathered, the reconnaissance that we gathered through our
foreign assets and assistance and also our domestic agencies,
in order to show that what the Russians were putting out was
false information. That was critically important because it
helped to preserve the NATO coalition in the war against
Ukraine.
I thought that those were the kind of things we were going
to talk about. I guess, Ms. Miller-Idriss, I guess you are
going to talk some about that.
With respect to the censorship issue--which is fine. We can
address it, I suppose. Although I'll note that, even though
it's an important issue, it's not really primarily within our
jurisdiction, which is why the Judiciary Committee already had
a hearing on this, I think, dealing with some of the same
issues. I guess we'll get into the Twitter Files and the like
in a few minutes.
I believe Section 230 was referenced in maybe your
testimony, Mr. Turley, with respect to the points that you want
to make, and that's fine.
But the censorship issue, which we can talk about, is kind-
of tangential to the primary mission of this committee, in my
view, which is protecting the homeland. I think that's why, in
large part, those issues have been separated out from our
jurisdiction here in the Congress and given to the Judiciary
Committee and, to some extent, Energy and Commerce, which also
had a hearing on this too.
We can talk about those issues. But for the witnesses, to
the extent you're up for it, one of the things I will be asking
you is how do we try and deal with the sort of issues that I
just mentioned.
I think, Mr. Turley, you reference in your testimony--I
want to say it was on page 11--that you recognize that there
are problems that can come from disinformation. The focus of
your testimony and your paper is on censorship, but I do want
to hear, though, with respect to dealing with these issues, how
do we address those? Some of those could be the same topics
that we just raised.
I think Ms. Miller-Idriss will say--and I share this view--
that censorship isn't the way to address those national
security issues and domestic security issues. We need to try
and find a way to address the misinformation and false
information, frequently by using counter-pushes on information
and the like, which I thought was what the board was set up to
do.
We'll talk about Nina Jankowicz at some length later in the
hearing today too. But I hope we can talk about those issues as
well.
Mr. Turley, I don't know if you testified in the Judiciary
Committee previously on this issue--you did. OK. So I
appreciate your views on that.
Gentlemen, I know you have strong views about what happened
to you personally with respect to that issue.
But I do hope that we'll find a way to talk about the
homeland security angles of these issues and what we need to do
to protect ourselves and our citizens from false information
that is being used against us as a Nation and is creating
domestic and foreign relations problems for us.
With that, I yield back.
[The statement of Ranking Member Ivey follows:]
Statement of Ranking Member Glenn Ivey
May 11, 2023
I would like to take a moment to express my deepest condolences for
the 8 people who were killed and at least 10 injured when an SUV
deliberately slammed into a crowd at a city bus stop near a shelter for
migrants in Brownsville, Texas.
I would also like to acknowledge the tragic act of targeted
violence at an outlet mall that left 8 people dead, including 3
children and 7 injured in Allen, Texas. Texas is 1 of 2 States in the
United States that has seen 17 mass shootings so far this year.
I'm heartened that next week, this subcommittee will be discussing
politically-motivated violence since the Texas shooter wore a ``right-
wing death squad'' patch and had potential ties to white supremacist
and extremist groups. Such violence can be stoked by misinformation,
disinformation, and mal-information (MDM)--the topic of this
afternoon's hearing.
I certainly think it is critical that we look at the impact of
false information on our country. For example, election denialism
pushed our democracy to the brink in 2020. It led former President
Trump to falsely claim that he had actually won the Presidential
election. And to call election officials like Georgia Secretary of
State Brad Raffensperger to pressure him into ``find[ing] 11,780
votes'' so he could claim victory. President Trump wasted taxpayer
dollars on unnecessary recounts.
Worse still, it's an on-going problem nationally, election
officials across the country are now planning public education
campaigns so the public is harder to fool with these kinds of false
election claims. We still have people here in Congress, on this
committee no less, who cannot bring themselves to admit that Trump lost
fair and square--even though they represent States in which Federal
judges (some of them Trump appointees) have expressly found that the
elections were not stolen and that the elections were fair and
accurate.
Donald Trump also created what I call verdict denialism, which
undermines the rule of law. He's already started saying that the jury's
verdict that he sexually assaulted Jean Carroll is a ``disgrace'', and
that the $5 million award is somehow unfair. This is just another one
of his endless ``witch hunt'' claims, even though judges keep rejecting
his denials and more indictments are likely to come.
He's not alone. Trump adviser Steve Bannon has been charged for
defrauding hundreds of thousands of donors out of $25 million dollars,
under the false pretense that all the monies raised for the ``We Build
the Wall'' campaign would be spent constructing the U.S.-Mexico border
wall.
Then there is Alex Jones, who used his media empire to say that the
massacre at Sandy Hook was staged by Democrats and that the grieving
parents were actually lying. He was told by a jury that he was the one
actually telling the lies. But he denies the verdict and ducks paying
over $1 billion in damages claims.
Then there are my colleagues and conservatives who still claim that
January 6 rioters were merely tourists. That they were merely peaceful
protestors, even though 5 officers died and countless more were
injured. More than 1,000 of those supposedly peaceful protestors have
been charged, 541 have pleaded guilty, and 14 have been convicted or
pleaded guilty of seditious conspiracy (basically an attempt to
overthrow the 2020 election). This is the kind of false information
that has been rejected by countless judges and juries, but the
falsehoods continue to be pushed. Even by my colleagues who know
better.
Let's move on to the false and misleading information issued before
Russia invaded Ukraine. Russia's goal was to splinter the NATO
coalition so it could attack Ukraine with impunity. Fortunately, the
United States countered the false information with reconnaissance that
showed the world that the Russians were lying, which held the coalition
together and gave Ukraine the international support it needed to impose
repeated defeats on the supposedly superior Russian military. This is
the kind of capability we need to meet the international threats that
we face as a Nation.
We also need to bolster our ability to fend off false information
from other dangerous actors in the world, including China and the drug
cartels who are flooding America with fentanyl. This is the kind of
focus that the House Homeland Security Committee should have.
Unfortunately, it appears that Republicans do not want to focus on
these dangers to our country.
When it comes to protecting our homeland, we all have an interest
in ensuring that the public has access to the accurate information they
need to keep their communities safe. I am looking forward to hearing
from the Democratic witness, Dr. Cynthia Miller-Idriss, who will
provide this subcommittee with information on preventative approaches
to combatting misinformation, disinformation, and mal-information.

Mr. Bishop. Thank you, Ranking Member Ivey.
Other Members of the committee are reminded that opening
statements may be submitted for the record.
[The statement of Ranking Member Thompson follows:]
Statement of Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson
May 11, 2023
I wholeheartedly agree with Ranking Member Ivey about how critical
it is that we examine the impact of false information on our Nation.
The spread of misinformation, disinformation, and mal-information--
including that tied to extremism--has been growing on-line,
particularly on social media, where there are little to no guardrails
to stop it. Unfortunately, false information and extremism don't just
stay on-line. They have real-world, often dangerous, and even violent
consequences.
So, let's discuss how the rampant spread of false information has
diminished public confidence in our democratic institutions and why
there is an appropriate role for DHS to counter disinformation when
carrying out its mission.
Disinformation regarding the 2020 Presidential election outcome led
to a violent attack against the Capitol aimed at preventing the
peaceful, lawful transfer of power.
Disinformation has similarly undermined the response to the COVID-
19 pandemic, frustrated disaster relief efforts, and exacerbated
political and social divisions.
When discussing disinformation, Republican Members might want to
look inward and at their own colleagues. Those on the other side have
spread lies about the integrity of our elections, promoted falsehoods
surrounding the COVID pandemic, called climate change a hoax, and
perpetuated disinformation about the border smugglers to line their
pockets, just to name a few.
Now, instead of using this subcommittee to focus on real challenges
facing DHS, they want to discuss the defunct DHS Disinformation
Governance Board. Republicans have spent more time discussing the Board
than it actually existed.
DHS announced the Disinformation Governance Board in April 2022,
paused the Board in May, and dissolved it in August. The idea behind
the Board was important--to identify disinformation that threatens the
homeland and disseminate accurate information to DHS components and
other stakeholders. Indeed, even though the Board was dissolved, the
Homeland Security Advisory Council and the Office of Inspector General
both underscored the legitimacy and criticality of DHS efforts to
address inaccurate information that may undermine its mission of
protecting the homeland.
The Department must be able to identify, analyze, and, where
necessary, address certain inaccurate information that could undermine
public safety and manipulate the American public, while ensuring
transparency and protecting civil liberties. It is imperative that the
Department continue to exercise its authorities to make timely and
accurate information regarding critical homeland security matters
available to the public. This responsibility is an outgrowth of DHS's
longstanding efforts at enhancing homeland security information sharing
stemming from the breakdowns leading to 9/11.
I hope today's hearing will examine solutions to the challenges DHS
is encountering and how Congress can provide the resources and tools
needed to protect our homeland.

STATEMENT OF BENJAMIN WEINGARTEN, INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST AND
COLUMNIST

Mr. Weingarten. Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Ivey, and
Members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to
testify.
Government's first charge is to defend the life and limb of
the governed. DHS and CISA have vital roles to play in this
regard. Because their mission is so critical, we are compelled
to scrutinize them in good faith. I offer today's testimony in
this spirit.
Our Republic rests on the inalienable right to free speech.
That right is under assault by those working to toss their
political foes into the digital gulag in defense of our
democracy.
Disturbingly, the Federal Government itself appears to be a
key culprit. Overwhelming evidence suggests Federal agencies,
top White House officials, and lawmakers, colluding with big
tech and often Government-coordinated and -funded
counterdisinformation groups, have imposed a mass public-
private censorship regime on the American people.
This regime has suppressed opinions that diverge from its
orthodoxy and even facts inconvenient to its agenda on an ever-
growing number of topics, starting with elections, moving to
COVID-19, and now covering many other contested issues, all
under the guise of national security and public health.
CISA is core to these efforts. CISA has served as a
censorship conductor, driving regular meetings between security
agencies and social media companies aimed at encouraging the
platforms to combat purported mis- and disinformation; that is,
to censor disfavored speech, as the Government so deems it and
by the Government that regulates them, and they have.
CISA has served as a censorship switchboard, in its words,
collecting purported misinformation from Government and non-
Government actors in the form of tweets, YouTube videos, and
even private Facebook messages, and relaying the flagged
content to the platforms to squelch it.
CISA has served as an architect of the broader public-
private censorship regime, helping originate, consult, network,
and partner with often Government-linked third parties who
themselves serve as First Amendment-circumventing, mass
surveillance, and mass censorship enterprises.
These systematic speech-stifling efforts, often targeting
core political speech and intensifying during elections, seem
tantamount to a conspiracy to violate the First Amendment and
running domestic election interference. In short, we've
unwittingly been paying unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats
to silence ourselves.
We're told these speech police are pursuing thought crimes
for our own good. Authorities say MDM, mis-, dis-, and
malinformation, fuels extremism and, therefore, that it must be
purged. They ask us to ignore the selective and cynical linking
of speech they disapprove of to terror, and they allied their
mandate to suppress truth, malinformation being based on fact,
by CISA's own definition, but the intent or impact of which our
betters disapprove of.
Never discussed are questions like: Who determines what
constitutes MDM? Should it be the state, which itself has cast
as MDM that which it later acknowledged was settled science, or
we the people?
If the state justifies speech regulation on national
security or public health grounds, what are the standards for
determining when wrong-think is sufficiently dangerous to rise
to the level of censorship?
If skepticism about mail-in balloting, which Jimmy Carter
and The New York Times once shared, or skepticism about COVID
policies that, if more widely heard, might have saved lives and
liberties, amount to violent extremist threats to critical
infrastructure, as DHS has indicated, making such speech ripe
for suppression, what about anti-cop sentiment or pro-abortion
sentiment or radical environmentalist sentiment?
If wrong-think must be verboten, why stop at censoring it
on social media? Why not pull every TV network that propagates
wrong-think off the air, or review every text in every library
and bookstore for wrong-think and burn the offending titles?
Why not censor wrong-thinkers' chats and emails? Why not
ban them from the internet and suspend their mail service
altogether? While we're at it, why not make it illegal for
wrong-thinkers to possess pens and pads too?
Would proponents of the censorship regime trust their worst
political foes with these powers? We may believe our fellow
Americans hold bad ideas, if not ideas that are plain wrong.
But the worst idea of all is that Government should be the
arbiter of what we're allowed to speak and hear.
We're a free people capable of judging ideas on their
merits, citizens, not subjects. Eviscerating the First
Amendment will neither make us more democratic nor more safe.
It would be the stuff of tyranny.
Congress has a responsibility to stand athwart history
yelling: Stop! With another election season looming, censorship
tools likely becoming more powerful, and the censorship
regime's ambitions only growing while it stonewalls and scrubs
evidence of its past doings, this subcommittee's oversight
efforts are most urgent.
This body should endeavor to fully expose DHS's role in
censorship, past and present and directly and by proxy, curtail
funding, implement legislative remedies, and hold accountable
all those who engaged in unconstitutional acts in connection
therewith.
Thank you, and I look forward to taking your questions.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Weingarten follows:]
Prepared Statement of Benjamin Weingarten
May 11, 2023
i. introduction
Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Ivey, and Members of the
subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today.\1\ It is
an honor and a privilege to appear before you to discuss the Department
of Homeland Security's (DHS) enabling of the silencing of dissent.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ I appear today on my own behalf, and my views do not
necessarily reflect those of the media or other organizations with
which I am affiliated.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Government's first charge is to defend the life and limb of the
governed. DHS generally, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency (CISA) specifically, have vital roles to play in this
regard. Given the criticality of their mission to protect the homeland,
these agencies must be held to exacting standards. Should they
experience mission creep, in so doing wielding powers in ways violative
of the Constitutional rights they are meant to secure for all
Americans, it compels good faith scrutiny. I offer today's testimony in
this spirit.
Our republic rests on the inalienable right to free speech. That
right is currently under assault by those working to consign their
political foes to the digital gulag in defense of ``our democracy.''
Disturbingly, the Federal Government itself appears to be a key
culprit. Overwhelming evidence \2\ suggests that Federal agencies--led
by, among others, CISA,\3\ \4\--buoyed by senior Executive branch
officials and lawmakers, colluding with Big Tech, and a coterie of
often Government-coordinated and Government-funded \5\ ``counter-
disinformation'' organizations, have imposed nothing less than a mass
public-private censorship \6\ regime on the American people.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ See generally Missouri v. Biden and Special Assistant Attorney
General for the Louisiana Department of Justice D. John Sauer's related
testimony before the House Judiciary Committee's Weaponization
Subcommittee at https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/
republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/2023-03/Sauer-Testimony.pdf;
Hines v. Stamos; and https://report.foundationforfreedomonline.com/11-
9-22.html.
\3\ DHS's Inspector General has reported that the agency's Office
of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) was also involved in counter-
disinformation efforts during the 2020 election season. Other DHS
components in the last several years have also worked to ``counter
disinformation originating from foreign and domestic sources.''
[Emphasis mine] See https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/
2022-08/OIG-22-58-Aug22.pdf#page=7. These efforts extend to other
agencies including the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI),
Department of Justice (DOJ), and Office of the Director of National
Intelligence (ODNI). Senior Executive branch officials and Federal
lawmakers have also publicly and privately exerted pressure on social
media companies to more aggressively police speech--at times under
threat of adverse regulatory or legislative action. See generally
Missouri v. Biden; https://www.wsj.com/articles/save-the-constitution-
from-big-tech-11610387105; https://www.newsweek.com/taxpayer-dollars-
must-not-fund-government-led-censorship-regime-opinion-1792828.

\5\ https://foundationforfreedomonline.com/bidens-national-science-
foundation-has-pumped-nearly-40-million-into-social-media-censorship-
grants-and-contracts/.
\6\ I use censorship herein broadly to encompass ``terminating
speakers' accounts, deplatforming speakers, temporarily suspending
accounts, imposing warnings or strikes against accounts to chill future
disfavored speech, `shadow banning' speakers, demonetizing content or
speakers, adjusting algorithms to suppress or de-emphasize speakers or
messages, deboosting speakers or content, promoting or demoting
content, placing warning labels or explanatory notes on content,
suppressing content in other users' feeds, promoting negative comments
on disfavored content, and requiring additional click-through(s) to
access content, and other methods,'' as plaintiffs in Hines v. Stamos
define it. See: https://aflegal.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Doc-1-
Complaint.pdf#page=9.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Authorities, led by the Federal Government, tell us this censorship
is for our own good--that we suffer from a pandemic of ``mis-, dis-,
and mal-information'' (MDM);\7\ that MDM fuels domestic terrorism;\8\
\9\ and therefore that America must undertake a whole-of-society effort
to combat MDM.\10\ For its part, the censorship regime has equated MDM
with Wrongthink--dissenting opinions from its orthodoxy, and even facts
\11\ inconvenient to its agenda, on an ever-growing number of
subjective and contentious issues.\12\ It conflates, cynically and
purposefully, genuine political difference with ``extremism,'' which it
links to danger and violence to justify speech policing.\13\ In turn,
the regime has surveilled the wide expanse of the digital public square
to identify such Wrongthink, and proceeded to suppress it under guise
of national security and public health.\14\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\7\ CISA has defined ``Misinformation'' as that which ``is false,
but not created or shared with the intention of causing harm.'' It has
defined ``Disinformation'' as that which ``is deliberately created to
mislead, harm, or manipulate a person, social group, organization, or
country.'' It has defined ``Malinformation'' as that which ``is based
on fact, but used out of context to mislead, harm, or manipulate.''
See: https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/mdm-
incident-response-guide_508.pdf. Setting aside the question of who is
to be the arbiter of truth in CISA's MDM paradigm, on what grounds, and
whether and to what extent Government ought to intervene accordingly,
the matter of intent baked into these definitions makes MDM a largely
subjective concept.

Terrorism.pdf.
\11\ https://nypost.com/2023/03/17/private-federal-censorship-
machine-targeted-true-misinformation/.
\12\ The targeting began largely with a focus on skepticism of the
integrity and outcome of the 2020 election; it expanded to encompass
derogatory views to those of Federal authorities--including those
ultimately proving true and even known to be true contemporaneously--
concerning virtually every aspect of COVID-19, and particularly around
mitigation efforts and their efficacy; since, Federal officials have
shown their intent to expand such targeting to cover ``abortion,
climate-related speech, `gendered disinformation,' economic policy, the
financial services industry, the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, the
war in Ukraine, and other[]'' topics, per recent testimony from
litigation counsel in Missouri v. Biden, Special Assistant Attorney
General for the Louisiana Department of Justice D. John Sauer. See:

had-strange-first-mission-banning-speech-that-casts-doubt-on-red-
mirage-blue-shift-election-events/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notably, the public-private speech police have targeted, for
example, skepticism about the integrity of mass mail-in balloting that
used to be shared on a bipartisan basis and was never linked to
``domestic violent extremism;''\15\ and skepticism about COVID-19
mitigation efforts that often proved not only justified, but which in
some instances, if more widely heard and understood, might have saved
lives and liberties. Given authorities have asserted, but not
necessarily established a clear and compelling nexus between the mere
expression of such views and wide-spread or dire threats of violence--
and certainly not threats justifying suspension of the First Amendment
to quell them, for which this non-lawyer witness finds little
precedent; and given that authorities show little equivalent concern or
zeal for suppressing a virtually limitless array of other views that
can be linked to violence--anti-cop sentiment to attacks on law
enforcement and widespread riots,\16\ pro-abortion sentiment to attacks
on pro-life centers and threats to judges,\17\ environmentalist
sentiment to attacks on relevant targets by eco-terrorists, etc.--this
indicates the speech-muzzling is rooted in politics, not the public
good. Understood in this light, the censorship regime's efforts start
to look like they are intended more for its own benefit, than ours.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The regime's systematic speech-stifling, targeting core political
speech and intensifying during recent Federal election cycles, seems
tantamount to a conspiracy to violate the First Amendment,\18\
viewpoint discrimination, and running domestic election interference--
ironically borne of claims of foreign election interference.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In short, Americans have unknowingly and unwittingly been paying
unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats to, directly and by proxy,
silence ourselves.
CISA has been described as a ``nerve center'' of these Federal
Government-led censorship efforts. It has served as a key facilitator
of, and participant in, meetings between Federal authorities and
technology companies aimed at encouraging the latter to combat
purported misinformation and disinformation. It has served as a
clearinghouse for social media content flagged for censorship by third
parties--Governmental and non-Governmental--relaying the parties'
censorship requests on to social media companies, and flagged perceived
problematic speech for the platforms directly.\19\ And it has helped
foster the development of the broader public-private censorship
architecture through consulting, partnering with, and networking often
Government-linked third-party organizations to themselves serve as
First Amendment-circumventing,\20\ mass-surveillance and mass-
censorship clearinghouses for content flagged by, among others,
Government partners.\21\ It is perhaps incalculable how many people
have been bereft of their right to speak, and listen, by way of these
censorship efforts--and at what cost.

\20\ As Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in his concurring opinion in
Biden v. Knight, a private entity violates the First Amendment ``if the
Government coerces or induces it to take action the Government itself
would not be permitted to do, such as censor expression of a lawful
viewpoint.'' Further, ``The Government cannot accomplish through
threats of adverse Government action what the Constitution prohibits it
from doing directly.'' See: https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/

Remarkably, we would know little of such efforts were it not for a
billionaire's decision to purchase a social media platform,\22\ and
then empower a handful of journalists to expose the Government-tied
censorship efforts in which it had been implicated;\23\ and the legal
action of vigilant State attorneys general, who, alongside the
silenced, sued implicated Federal authorities, and through discovery
began to untangle this twisted censorship web.\24\

\24\ See Missouri v. Biden.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
As its role in the censorship regime has started to come into
focus, CISA has gone about scrubbing evidence of its associated
efforts;\25\ it has reorganized related entities;\26\ and it has
stonewalled Congressional investigators\27\--while maintaining that, as
the agency's Director, Jen Easterly put it in recent Congressional
testimony, ``We don't censor anything'' or ``flag anything for social
media organizations at all.''\28\

It is hard to fully square this position with what we have learned
to date. Congress can and should help resolve this seeming dispute. At
minimum, the troubling evidence suggests the national security
apparatus's apparent interest in Americans' speech warrants oversight,
without which, if merited, there can be no accountability and reform.
This subcommittee's engagement, therefore, alongside other committees
with relevant jurisdiction,\29\ is most welcome and necessary. It is
also most urgent, with the 2024 elections looming, censorship tools
becoming more sophisticated and powerful,\30\ and the censorship
regime's ambitions only growing--alongside its footprint.\31\ \32\ \33\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
To help inform this subcommittee's efforts, I will briefly address
how CISA came to take on a pivotal role in this censorship regime,
detail its associated actions, and offer recommendations for further
oversight.
ii. how cisa became a ``nerve center'' of america's censorship regime
The plaintiffs in the landmark pending case, Missouri v. Biden,
allege, and have revealed a trove of information substantiating the
claim that there is a ``massive, sprawling Federal `Censorship
Enterprise,' which includes dozens of Federal officials across at least
11 Federal agencies and components, who communicate with social-media
platforms about misinformation, disinformation, and the suppression of
private speech on social media--all with the intent and effect of
pressuring social-media platforms to censor and suppress private speech
that Federal officials disfavor,'' in violation of the First
Amendment.\34\ The plaintiffs identify CISA specifically as a ``nerve
center'' of Federal Government-led speech policing, which began in
earnest in the run-up to the 2020 election.\35\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\34\ https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/
gov.uscourts.lawd.189520/gov.uscourts.lawd.189- 520.268.0.pdf/.
\35\ https://ago.mo.gov/docs/default-source/press-releases/212-3-
proposed-findings-of-fact.pdf?sfvrsn=739f8cbf_2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Several key developments help to explain how a DHS sub-agency
tasked with preventing cyber attacks and defending physical
infrastructure would come to occupy a central role in this censorship
effort. Among them are that: (i) Donald Trump won the 2016 Presidential
election. (ii) His victory came to be seen by many as being enabled by
(a) Social media and (b) Russian interference on social media aimed at
elevating Trump's candidacy. These developments would both escalate to
a matter of national security ``content moderation''--a euphemism for
speech regulation up to and including deplatforming--and fuel the
creation of America's mass public-private censorship regime.\36\ (iii)
In partial response, in January 2017 out-going DHS Secretary Jeh
Johnson designated election infrastructure as a critical infrastructure
subsector, putting elections ultimately under CISA's purview.\37\ \38\
(iv) That same year, the State Department established the Global
Engagement Center (GEC), tasked with leading Federal efforts to
``counter foreign state and non-state propaganda and disinformation
efforts aimed at undermining United States national security
interests.''\39\ The FBI also established its Foreign Influence Task
Force (FITF) to ``identify and counteract malign foreign influence
operations targeting the United States,'' with an explicit emphasis on
voting and elections.\40\ (v) Following suit, in 2018 DHS stood up a
Countering Foreign Influence Task Force comprised of CISA's Election
Security Initiative division, and Office of Intelligence and Analysis
(I&A) staff. Its purpose, according to a recent DHS Office of Inspector
General (OIG) report, was to focus on ``election infrastructure
disinformation.''\41\ (vi) On top of this counter-disinformation
mobilization, certain Federal lawmakers increasingly chided social
media platforms for dithering on ``content moderation,'' including but
not exclusively pertaining to foreign adversaries.\42\ (vii) Amid the
Government's growing counter-disinformation push, a constellation of
sometimes state-funded non-Governmental counter-disinformation
organizations grew alongside it.\43\

infrastructure as ``storage facilities, polling places, and centralized
vote tabulations locations used to support the election process, and
information and communications technology to include voter registration
databases, voting machines, and other systems to manage the election
process and report and display results on behalf of State and local
governments.''

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This by no means exhaustive list of developments, combined with two
shifts in the posture of key players within the looming censorship
regime, would create the conditions for, and leave CISA uniquely
positioned to serve as a linchpin of it. First, Federal authorities and
their future private-sector partners \44\ would train their sights
increasingly on domestic Wrongthinkers over foreign adversaries as key
disinformation threat actors--or at minimum focus on the content of
speech over the country of origin of the speaker. Second, they would
begin to treat words critical of institutions as threats to those
institutions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\44\ https://rumble.com/v1gx8h7-dhss-foreign-to-domestic-
disinformation-switcheroo.html/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In CISA's case, under its first Director Chris Krebs, who served
through the 2020 election cycle, that meant targeting speech dubious of
election administration and outcomes as a threat to election
infrastructure. Under his successor, infrastructure would come to
comprise nearly every significant institution, and now, even our
brains. Director Easterly would argue that the American mind--``our
cognitive infrastructure''--is ``the most critical infrastructure,''
obligating authorities to ``protect'' such infrastructure.\45\ One way
to do so would be through controlling the information space by
suppressing disfavored narratives--hence the efforts she would take to
``grow and strengthen my misinformation and disinformation team.''\46\
\47\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\45\ https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/580990-cyber-agency-
beefing-up-disinformation-misinformation-team/.
\46\ Ibid.
\47\ The Biden administration in fact would incorporate this view
into its first-of-its-kind National Strategy for Countering Domestic
Terrorism, in calling for Government to ``accelerat[e] work to contend
with an information environment that challenges healthy democratic
discourse'' as part of its effort to ``confront long-term contributors
to domestic terrorism.'' See: https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/
uploads/2021/06/National-Strategy-for-Countering-Domestic-
Terrorism.pdf#page=29/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Accordingly, CISA would come to equate first the American public's
skeptical tweets on subjects like mail-in voting with attacks on
election infrastructure, and later a growing list of dissident views on
other issues as threats to relevant infrastructure, and arrogate unto
itself the power to neutralize the threats through helping orchestrate
a public-private censorship regime.
iii. cisa's leadership in the censorship regime
In fact, CISA would not only help orchestrate widespread censorship
efforts, but would actively participate in them. During the 2020
election, and in some instances continuing and expanding thereafter,
findings from Missouri v. Biden and additional supporting evidence
demonstrate that CISA officials contribute to censorship efforts
directly and by proxy.
CISA's Direct Censorship-Related Efforts
Among other direct actions CISA officials have taken with respect
to countering MDM, personnel:\48\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\48\ Since much of the available record details CISA activities
prior to the 2022 midterm elections, it is not entirely clear in some
instances whether certain activities persist. This only further
underscores the need for Congressional oversight.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Convene and coordinate meetings between national security
and law enforcement agencies, and technology companies--
including not just social media platforms Facebook/Meta,
Google, Twitter, and Reddit, but also Microsoft, Verizon Media,
Pinterest, LinkedIn, and Wikimedia Foundation \49\--aimed at
combating purported misinformation and disinformation. These
meetings occur more frequently in the run-up to elections.\50\
CISA is party to at least five sets of recurring confabs with
social media platforms touching on MDM and/or policing of
speech on said platforms, separate and apart from the many
bilateral such meetings CISA hosts.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\49\ See https://twitter.com/MSFTIssues/status/
1293623288262987777?s=20. While much of this testimony focuses on the
actions of social media platforms, the inclusion of other technology
companies in conversations with U.S. Government agencies about MDM
suggests oversight need be done on the actions of these companies in
conjunction with the Federal Government as well.
\50\ Officials from CISA, DHS's I&A division, ODNI, FITF, and other
agencies attend the meetings. See: https://ago.mo.gov/docs/default-
source/press-releases/212-3-proposed-findings-of-
fact.pdf?sfvrsn=739f8cbf_2#page=218.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In 2020 meetings with social media companies, CISA and
other officials warned of potential foreign ``hack-and-
leak'' operations to come during the election. Major social
media companies would proceed to censor the New York Post's
reporting on the contents of Hunter Biden's laptop--
indicating Biden family influence peddling--weeks from the
2020 Presidential election, on false grounds that it was
the product of such a ``hack-and-leak.''\51\

proposed-findings-of-fact.- pdf?sfvrsn=739f8cbf_2#page=274.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

It has been reported that Government warnings about
``hack-and-leaks'' led platforms to change their terms of
service in the run-up to the 2020 election to suppress
related content. In CISA-convened industry meetings,
content moderation policies are a regular topic, and CISA
regularly communicates with social media platforms about
such policies.\52\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

``Switchboard'' reports of purported misinformation and
disinformation from State and local authorities, among others,
beginning in 2018 and expanding through the 2020 election.
Switchboarding entails receiving and then forwarding reports of
offending content to social media platforms for censorship.
Officials did so without assessing whether the content came
from foreign or domestic speakers. Among other notable points
about these efforts:

CISA staff switchboarded misinformation reports, for
example, flagging tweets for censorship alleging election
fraud, that ballots were not counted, and mail-in voting
was implemented to benefit Democrats. One such report
forwarded by a CISA official to Twitter called for ``swift
removal of . . . posts and continued monitoring of the
user's account'' because said user had ``claimed . . . that
mail-in voting is insecure,'' and that ``conspiracy
theories about election fraud are hard to discount.''
Twitter reported back to CISA it had taken action pursuant
to its policy on Civic Integrity.\53\

189520.214.1_1.pdf#page=267.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Staffers also switchboarded misinformation reports
flagging obviously satirical social media accounts for
censorship, including one Colorado Twitter account with 56
followers ``UnOfficialCOgov.'' The user's biographical
information read: ``dm us your weed store location (hoes be
mad, but this is a parody account).''\54\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

A CISA switchboard tracking spreadsheet from 2020 suggests
that in certain instances, officials from both CISA and DHS
I&A were the originators of flagged content ultimately
conveyed by CISA staff to social media companies for
review.\55\

private postings on social media platforms.\56\

Coordinate with public and private-sector partners,
including social media companies ``on a variety of projects to
build resilience against malicious information activities,'' as
well as supporting ``private-sector partners' COVID-19 response
efforts via regular reporting and analysis of key pandemic-
related MDM trends.''\60\ This is part and parcel of what
CISA's Cybersecurity Advisory Committee has described as a
``burgeoning MDM effort'' that includes ``directly engaging
with social media companies to flag MDM.''\61\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The coordination referenced above comes from a bulletin CISA posted
on its website detailing the work of its MDM team--the successor to its
Countering Foreign Influence Task Force. The creation of that team
formally codified the transition that had already taken place during
the 2020 election cycle, from a focus on foreign to domestic
speech.\62\ In February 2023, CISA pulled down that site, redirecting
viewers to a ``Foreign Influence Operations and Disinformation'' page
that makes no mention of domestic actors. One can only speculate as to
why CISA made this change.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\62\ https://web.archive.org/web/20211231181148/ https://
www.cisa.gov/mdm.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
CISA would also expand its focus to encompass not just MDM around
elections, or COVID-19 vaccine efficacy under banner of defending
public health infrastructure,\63\ but ``all types of disinformation, to
be responsive to current events,'' according to an official quoted in
an August 2022 DHS OIG Report.\64\ Evidence collected in Missouri v.
Biden indicates CISA has been involved in combatting ``misinformation''
with respect to the on-going Russo-Ukrainian War,\65\ and on an
initiative in conjunction with the Treasury Department to address MDM
regarding the financial services industry.\66\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In a January 2023 deposition taken in connection with Missouri v.
Biden, the chief of CISA's MDM Team, Brian Scully, asserted that his
team had a mandate that was almost limitless, in pursuing MDM that
could affect ``critical infrastructure in a number of ways,'' including
causing ``reputational risk [that] could come about if the integrity or
the public confidence in a particular sector was critical to that
sector's functioning.''\67\

proposed-findings-of-fact.pdf- ?sfvrsn=739f8cbf_2#page=282.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is also possible CISA's efforts have extended beyond social
media companies, and perhaps the other technology companies with which
it and other Federal agencies have regularly met in connection with
combatting MDM. A June 2022 report from CISA's Cybsersecurity Advisory
Committee Subcommittee on Protecting Critical Infrastructure from
Misinformation and Disinformation (``MDM subcommittee'') suggests that
CISA should approach the mis- and dis-information problem ``with the
entire information ecosystem in view.'' This means focusing not just on
social media platforms, but ``mainstream media, cable news, hyper-
partisan media, talk radio, and other on-line resources.''\68\ CISA
would, as with its MDM webpage, scrap its MDM subcommittee, as first
publicized in a late 2022 summary of an advisory board meeting.\69\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
As significant as CISA's MDM efforts have been, DHS's counter-
disinformation operations spread far beyond the sub-agency. According
to the aforementioned August 2022 DHS OIG report, numerous components
inside DHS have in recent years been targeting MDM foreign and
domestic. What's more, the report details that DHS planned to target
``inaccurate information'' on myriad topics including ``the origins of
the COVID-19 pandemic and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, racial
justice, U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the nature of U.S.
support to Ukraine.''\70\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\70\ https://theintercept.com/2022/10/31/social-media-
disinformation-dhs/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Corroborating the OIG Report, one document revealed in connection
with Congressional inquiries into DHS's stunted Disinformation
Governance Board (DGB) indicated that myriad ``DHS components are
already engaged in countering disinformation,'' alongside ``excellent
work being done by interagency partners, the private sector, and
academia--particularly concerning identifying and analyzing
disinformation,'' which ``DHS should leverage.''\71\ A subsequent
memorandum would indicate that the DGB would ``support and coordinate .
. . MDM work with other departments and agencies, the private sector,
and non-Government actors.'' The purpose of creating the DGB, in other
words, was not so much to establish a ``Ministry of Truth,'' but, as
plaintiffs in Missouri v. Biden aptly describe it, ``to impose a
bureaucratic structure on the enormous censorship activities already
occurring involving dozens of Federal officials and many Federal
agencies''--that is, to oversee many such ministries.\72\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
CISA's Proxy Censorship-Related Efforts
Not all of these ministries are to be found within the Federal
Government. CISA officials coordinate and partner with non-Governmental
entities who both mass-surveil social media content for purported MDM,
and serve as clearinghouses for receipt of flagged content, which they
then relay to social media platforms for censorship--in an apparent bid
to circumvent the First Amendment via cut-out.
CISA has primarily partnered with three non-Governmental entities,
beginning during the 2020 election cycle, to facilitate the flow of
problematic content for potential censorship to social media platforms:
The Center for Internet Security (CIS) and its CISA-funded Election
Infrastructure--Information Sharing & Analysis Center (EI-ISAC); and
two consortia: The Election Integrity Partnership (EIP), and a
successor organization folding in additional partners, the Virality
Project (VP).
CIS is a nonprofit that collects and forwards reports of
disinformation from State and local government officials to social
media platforms, and which continued to do so during the 2022 election
cycle.\73\ As CISA's switchboarding activities became too labor-
intensive for it, CISA would direct election officials to report
content to be flagged for social media platforms to CIS. CISA would
also help connect CIS, and various election official groups, with EIP.

judiciary.house.gov/files/2023-03/Sauer-Testimony.pdf#page=19.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
EIP is a non-Governmental ``anti-disinformation'' consortium that
was conceived by and created in consultation with CISA officials in the
run-up to the 2020 election. Its stated purpose was to fill the
``critical gap'' created by the fact no Federal agency ``has a focus
on, or authority regarding, election misinformation originating from
domestic sources within the United States.''\74\ That lack of
``authority'' may have included both an inability for Government
agencies, to access social media platform data--as EIP did--as well as
``very real First Amendment questions'' regarding EIP's work, as a key
player in the consortium, Renee DiResta, would acknowledge.\75\

Stanford Internet Observatory (SIO).--Founded in June 2019
by former Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos, several
of SIO's students came up with the idea for EIP while serving
as CISA interns.\77\ Stamos serves on CISA's Cybersecurity
Advisory Committee. He and Chris Krebs, CISA's director through
the 2020 election, formed a consultancy in late 2020 called the
Krebs/Stamos Group. CISA's top election official through 2020,
Matt Masterson, who was involved in the establishment of EIP,
joined SIO as a fellow after leaving CISA in January 2021.
SIO's Research Manager, the aforementioned DiResta, served as a
Subject-Matter Expert for CISA's Cybersecurity Advisory
Committee's since-abolished MDM subcommittee.\78\

Collectively, these groups sought to ``fill the gap'' by creating a
mass-surveillance and censorship-flagging platform aimed at ``content
intended to suppress voting, reduce participation, confuse voters as to
election processes, or delegitimize election results without
evidence.''\83\ In practice, this meant targeting for suppression
speech dubious of an unprecedented election given the sweeping,
pandemic-driven changes made to the voting system that cycle, whereby
the razor-thin final results in key States did not materialize for
days.\84\ EIP did so in part through lobbying social media platforms to
adopt more aggressive content moderation policies around election
rhetoric, and flagging relevant content including entire narratives via
``tickets'' for suppression by social media platforms under their often
EIP-influenced terms. EIP analysts--some 120 of whom worked on the
project in the waning days of the 2020 election--both identified
content for flagging via tickets, and incorporated requests from
``trusted external stakeholders.''\85\ It lists three such Governmental
stakeholders: CISA,\86\ CISA-backed EI-ISAC, and the State Department's
GEC. EIP in fact connected ``Government partners'' with ``platform
partners''--understood to be the social media companies--to enable the
former to debunk flagged content directly for the latter.\87\

\86\ It is worth noting that CISA and EIP's relationship went both
ways. At times, evidence suggests, CISA would forward reports of
misinformation received directly from EIP on to social media platforms
for their review.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some raw numbers concerning EIP's efforts during the 2020 election
cycle alone illustrate the size and scope of its effort. EIP:

Collected 859 million tweets for ``misinformation''
analysis.

Flagged for Twitter tweets shared 22 million times
ultimately labeled ``misinformation,'' a disproportionate
percentage of which were dinged for ``delegitimization,''\88\
which Twitter adopted as a standard for suppression.\89\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\88\ EIP cites as an example of delegitimization ``Claims of fraud
or malfeasance with inaccurate or missing evidence.'' See: https://
storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.lawd.189520/
gov.uscourts.lawd.189520.209.2.pdf#page=25.

tweets EIP ensnared. The competing arguments can be seen here: https://
twitter.com/MikeBenzCyber/status/1644110224150736897?s=20.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Influenced platforms to take action on 35 percent of all
URLs flagged--21 percent slapped with a warning label where
content remained visible, 13 percent removed, and 1 percent
``soft-blocked'' with a warning one would have to bypass to
view the content.\90\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pushed platforms to target dozens of ``misinformation
narratives'' for throttling.

Impacted hundreds of millions of posts and videos across
major social media platforms via the terms of service policy
changes for which EIP lobbied. EIP members openly boasted that
technology companies would never have modified their terms
accordingly without EIP's insistence and ``huge regulatory
pressure'' from Government.\91\

Further demonstrating the interconnection between EIP and CISA, the
group featured former CISA Director Chris Krebs at the launch seminar
associated with the report in which it divulged some of these figures.
Of note, EIP coded less than 1 percent of its tickets for having an
element of foreign interference. EIP characterized all 21 of the ``most
prominent repeat spreaders'' of election integrity ``misinformation''
on Twitter as ``conservative or right-wing.''\92\ Of the civil society
groups that submitted tickets to the EIP, many had a left-leaning
bent--including the DNC itself.\93\ None appear to have been right-
leaning.

Mike Benz, a former State Department Cyber official during the
Trump administration, has found that many principals in EIP leadership
were heavily invested in the idea that Russia interfered in the 2016
Presidential election, to President Trump's benefit, and that they or
the organizations with which they were affiliated were critical
generally of Trump and Western populist movements. In an associated
report, he concludes that given the backgrounds of EIP's principals,
when originally conceived in June 2020 it should have been understood
to be ``a partisan, powerfully connected political network, panicked
that Americans might push back on the use of mail-in ballots months in
the future,'' convened ``to stop that pushback from happening by
unleashing censorship of the internet on a scale never before seen in
American history.''\94\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Though the EIP's efforts would re-emerge in the 2022 election, in
the interim it also launched a successor effort called the Virality
Project, targeting MDM spreading in relation to COVID-19, such as
``narratives that questioned the safety, distribution, and
effectiveness of the vaccines.'' Its leaders, including Stamos
communicated with CISA officials about their efforts, as they did
during the original EIP operation. DiResta would serve as principal
executive editor of its final April 2022 report, and contributors
included herself alongside Kate Starbird and Matt Masterson. Several
current and former CISA interns are also listed as ``researchers and
analysts'' who monitored social media platforms in connection with the
project.
The VP's stakeholders included Federal health agencies, working
alongside social media platforms to combat, for example, vaccine-
related ``misinformation.'' All told, the Virality Project tracked
content with 6.7 million engagements on social media per week--or over
200 million during the 7 months over which the project transpired.
Much of what the VP cast as ``misinformation'' included true facts
to the extent they portrayed narratives with which the project's
leaders--and certainly its Government partners--disapproved of, from
reports of vaccine injuries to discussion of ``breakthrough'' cases and
``natural immunity,'' to discussion of potential then-hypothetical
vaccine mandates. VP particularly targeted the speech of ``health
freedom'' groups, and like EIP, overwhelmingly targeted right-leaning
figures.
iv. conclusion
We may find much of the speech that social media platforms have
suppressed in recent years under Government coercion, cajoling, and/or
collusion to be wrongheaded or objectionable. But infinitely more
wrongheaded, objectionable, and indeed dangerous for a free society
than the proliferation of ``bad ideas'' is perhaps the worst idea of
all: That Government should be the arbiter of what we are allowed to
think and speak.
The notion that to ensure the health and safety of the country, the
public and private sectors must work together to silence those who
express unauthorized opinions, that such opinions are to be treated as
threats to an infinitely flexible definition of ``critical
infrastructure,'' and those who hold them as actual or would-be
domestic terrorists, is the stuff of tyranny.
That the state itself has treated as dangerous MDM that which
ultimately often has become settled science--indicating Government
officials and their partners en masse should have been deplatformed
themselves by their own standards--illustrates the folly of this
project.
To turn over to the state and its private sector ancillaries a
monopoly on narrative would ultimately give these partners a monopoly
on power, reducing us from citizens with agency to hapless subjects.
We are a free people capable of evaluating information and ideas
for ourselves to discern fact from fiction, and separate good ideas
from bad.
Historically, we would have held in utter contempt authorities who
would suggest we are incapable of thinking for ourselves, and that for
our own benefit, since the authorities know best, that they will do the
thinking for us--while silencing those who dare dissent.
No American should stand for it today.
If, as the foregoing suggests, CISA, and perhaps other DHS
components, have played an integral role in imposing a mass public-
private censorship regime on the American people, it is incumbent upon
this and other relevant Congressional bodies to get to the bottom of
it.
This subcommittee can help develop a comprehensive picture of the
``public'' side of the regime within DHS by using its oversight powers
to, over a time line beginning from CISA's inception in November 2018,
pursue the following questions:

Which offices and personnel within CISA \95\ are or have
been engaged in social media censorship efforts, or related
efforts to impact any other part of the ``information
ecosystem'' as CISA has defined it?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\95\ Plaintiffs in Missouri v. Biden assert that ``On information
and belief, CISA maintains a number of task forces, working groups, and
similar organizations as joint Government-private enterprises, which
provide avenues for Government officials to push for censorship of
disfavored viewpoints and speakers online.'' See: https://
storage.courtlistener.com/recap/- gov.uscourts.lawd.189520/
gov.uscourts.lawd.189520.268.0.pdf#page-87.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which other DHS agencies, and/or Federal, State, county, and
local government entities have CISA coordinated with in
connection with social media censorship efforts, or related
efforts to impact any other part of the ``information
ecosystem'' as CISA has defined it?

Which entities within DHS, independent of CISA, if any,\96\
engaged in social media censorship efforts, or related efforts
to impact any other part of the ``information ecosystem'' as
CISA has defined it?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\96\ An August 10, 2022 DHS Office of Inspector General report
indicates that several other DHS components have engaged over ``the
last 3 years to counter disinformation originating from foreign and
domestic sources.'' [Emphasis mine] See https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/
default/files/assets/2022-08/OIG-22-58-Aug22.pdf#page=10.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

What specific policies and practices has each DHS entity
developed and undertaken in connection with each respective
censorship effort?

Is there a comprehensive list of all communications,
technology, media, educational, non-profit, and any other non-
governmental agency with which DHS broadly engaged in fostering
its censorship efforts?

What level of Federal funding has each DHS entity received
to carry out such censorship efforts?

What level of Federal funding has each private-sector entity
with which DHS interacted in its censorship efforts received?

What have been the qualitative and quantitative impacts of
such censorship efforts during periods leading up to and
immediately following the 2020 and 2022 elections?

What censorship efforts are CISA and/or any other DHS
agencies engaging in at present, and/or planning for in
anticipation of the 2024 elections?
Only with full transparency can Congress and the American people
understand the full size and scope of this portion of the censorship
regime and determine what if anything Congress ought to do about it--be
it in terms of withholding funding, curtailing operations, and/or
holding malefactors to account.
If indeed we have had a mass public-private censorship regime
foisted upon us, defunding, dismantling, and deterring Government
officials from participating in, or funding such an apparatus ever
again, would seem to be of the utmost importance.
Congress should be commended for efforts already under way to
prevent such behavior.\97\ I hope it will do more.

Once again, thank you for the honor of appearing before you to
discuss these important issues, and I would be happy to answer any
questions from the committee.

Mr. Bishop. Thank you, Mr. Weingarten.
I now recognize Dr. Kulldorff for 5 minutes for his opening
statement.

STATEMENT OF MARTIN KULLDORFF, PH.D., EPIDEMIOLOGIST AND
BIOSTATISTICIAN

Mr. Kulldorff. Thank you all for having me here.
Censorship can be deadly. Freedom of speech is always
important, but it is especially important during a national
emergency, such as a pandemic. No authority is infallible. When
a new virus emerges, it is impossible for politicians and
public health officials to get everything right without
listening to discussions between a wide cast of scientists with
different ideas and expertise and thoughts.
I'm an epidemiologist, a biostatistician, and a professor
of medicine at Harvard on leave. For over two decades I've done
research on the detection and monitoring of infectious disease
outbreaks and on the safety evaluation of vaccines and drugs. I
helped build the Nation's disease surveillance systems. Despite
this, I was censored and blacklisted during the pandemic by
Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, and Facebook.
In early 2020, we already knew from Wuhan data that there
is more than a thousandfold difference in COVID mortality
between the old and the young. During the pandemic, we failed
to adequately protect older Americans while school closures and
other lockdown measures generated enormous collateral public
health damage that we now must live with, and die from, for
years to come.
During the spring of 2020, Sweden was the only major
Western country to keep schools and daycare open for children
ages 1 to 15. Among those 1.8 million children, there were zero
COVID deaths and the COVID risk for teachers was less than the
average of other professions.
This showed that it was safe to keep schools open. It was
important for America to know that, but in July 2020, a New
England Journal of Medicine article on school closures did not
even mention Sweden. That's like reporting on a new medical
treatment without including information from the comparison
control group.
Unable to publish my thoughts about the pandemic in U.S.
English-language media, in the summer of 2020 I used my Twitter
account to share the Swedish data and argue for open schools.
But in July 2020, Twitter put me on their ``trends blacklist''
to limit the reach of my open school posts.
In October 2020, I authored the Great Barrington
Declaration with two fellow epidemiologists. We argued for
better protection of high-risk older people while keeping
schools open and letting young people live more normal lives.
This was shadow banned by Google and censored by Reddit. Our
Facebook page was unpublished.
In March 2021, Twitter censored a post when I wrote that,
quote, ``Thinking that everybody must be vaccinated is as
scientifically flawed as thinking that nobody should. COVID
vaccines are important for older high-risk people and their
caretakers. Those with prior natural infection do not need it.
Nor children.'' Twitter falsely claimed that the tweet was
misleading and it could not be replied to, shared, or liked.
We have known about infection-acquired immunity since the
Athenian Plague in 430 BC, and the questioning, denial, and
censoring of such natural immunity is the most stunning denial
of a scientific fact during the pandemic--with deadly
consequences.
At a time when vaccines were in short supply, we were
vaccinating young adults and people with natural immunity who
did not need it before many older Americans whose lives could
have been saved by it.
Another example. Through randomized studies and reviews, we
know that face masks provide only marginal or no protection
against COVID. It is then dangerous to make older high-risk
Americans believe that masks will protect them when they will
not, as they may go to crowded restaurants or supermarkets
thinking that their mask is keeping them safe.
In May 2021, I was temporarily suspended by Twitter for 3
weeks for writing that, ``Naively fooled to think that masks
would protect them, some older high-risk people did not
socially distance properly, and some died from COVID-19 because
of it. Tragic. Public health officials/scientists must always
be honest with the public.''
In April 2021, I participated in a scientific roundtable
hosted by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. This was censored by
YouTube.
Many nurses were infected while heroically taking care of
COVID patients, and some of them were later fired for not
taking a vaccine even though they had stronger immunity than
the vaccinated. In October 2021, I wrote an article urging
hospitals to hire instead of fire nurses with natural immunity,
as they are the least likely to infect older frail patients.
This was censored by LinkedIn.
The primary victim of censorship is not me and others being
censored, but the public. As politicians, to properly serve
your constituents, you have both the right to hear from and the
duty to listen to a range of scientists. The public also has
that right.
Censorship inevitably leads to self-censoring. Some of my
public health colleagues do not speak up for fear of being
censored, silenced, or slandered, like I was.
When the Bill of Rights was written, Americans had lived
through troubled times. They did not use that as an excuse for
censorship. I think they understood that freedom of speech is
especially important during difficult times when difficult
decisions must be made.
I hope that the 118th Congress is just as wise as the first
Congress was when it adopted the First Amendment as part of the
Bill of Rights.
Thank you very much for listening.

As a leading expert on vaccine safety, CDC asked me to serve on

fired me from that group.\16\ If you think I was fired for questioning
the vaccines, you are wrong. I am probably the only person fired by CDC
for being too pro-vaccine. On April 13, 2021, CDC paused the Johnson &
Johnson vaccine after reports of blood clots in a few women under age
50. There were no reported cases among older people, who benefit the
most from the vaccines. Since there was a general vaccine shortage at
the time, I argued in an op-ed in The Hill that the vaccine should not
be paused for older high-risk Americans.\17\ That got me fired,

I have a question for you: Do we have freedom of speech because of
the First Amendment or do we have the First Amendment because freedom
of speech is important to preserve society and life?
When the Bill of Rights was written, Americans had lived through
troubled times. They did not use that as an excuse for censorship. I
think they understood that freedom of speech is especially important
during difficult times when difficult decisions must be made. I hope
that the 118th Congress is just as wise as the 1st Congress was when it
adopted the First Amendment as part of the Bill of Rights.
Thank you for listening.

Mr. Bishop. Thank you, Dr. Kulldorff.
I now recognize Dr. Miller-Idriss for her 5-minute opening
statement.

STATEMENT OF CYNTHIA MILLER-IDRISS, PH.D., PROFESSOR, SCHOOL OF
PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND SCHOOL OF EDUCATION, FOUNDING DIRECTOR,
POLARIZATION AND EXTREMISM RESEARCH AND INNOVATION LAB,
AMERICAN UNIVERSITY

Ms. Miller-Idriss. Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Ivey,
Members of the committee, I'd like to thank you for your
service to our country and for calling attention to the
critical issue of disinformation.
In addition to being a professor at American University, I
also direct a research lab there called the Polarization and
Extremism Research and Innovation Lab, also known as PERIL.
PERIL designs, tests, and scales up evidence-based tools
and intervention strategies to help people recognize and reject
harmful on-line content while safeguarding their freedom of
speech as an alternative to security-based approaches that rely
on surveillance, monitoring, censorship, or banning.
We do not teach people what to think. Our work is
nonpartisan and rooted in evidence. Our research has
demonstrated with consistent statistical significance that
people can learn to recognize persuasive and manipulative
tactics in order to make more informed choices in their lives,
especially on-line.
Over the past 3 years, PERIL has fielded a constant stream
of emails and calls from individuals in communities across the
country, all asking for help confronting the impacts of
disinformation and propaganda in their lives.
In Michigan, a grandfather and military veteran wrote to
ask what he could do about his grandson, who had joined an
armed militia.
In Texas, faith leaders asked us for ways to support
pastors whose congregations were torn apart by partisan
polarization and conspiracy theories.
In Vermont, a local entrepreneur asked if the school system
could help prevent future employees, most of whom he hired from
the high school, from espousing propaganda that had become a
problem in his staff.
These stories illustrate what research evidence has also
demonstrated: We face a national crisis rooted in the rampant
circulation of disinformation and harmful on-line content.
American communities are coming to us because they feel
threatened by on-line disinformation. They aren't alone.
As the ADL has reported, white supremacist propaganda
efforts are at the highest level ever recorded, jumping 38
percent over 2021 levels, following a pattern of violence that
has been escalating for years.
The good news is there's a growing body of evidence about
what works to equip the public with tools that shore up their
own capacity while protecting the right to free speech and
reducing the need for security-based approaches.
We found that it only takes 7 to 12 minutes of reading one
of our intervention guides for its audience to be significantly
better informed about harmful on-line content and the risks of
violence, to be more empowered and confident about intervening,
to build their own capability to intervene, and to know where
to get more help.
Importantly, across our work, we've found that both prior
to and after reading our parents and caregivers guide,
Democrats and Republicans did not significantly differ in their
knowledge.
Republicans scored better, significantly better, 5 percent
better than Democrats did, in terms of knowledge of extremism
after having read our guide, and members of both political
parties reported being satisfied with the guide's contents and
equally willing to intervene with a young person.
There's also strong emerging evidence that even short
interventions can have a lasting impact on local communities.
We're currently studying a group of 1,500 parents in 3-month
intervals, parents and caregivers, for a full year after
reading our intervention tool.
Three months after reading our guide, 11 percent, over 11
percent said that after the intervention they either joined or
created a group to discuss issues of youth radicalization.
Six percent of our participants, or about 75 people, told
us that within the 3 months after reading our guide they used
what they learned to take direct action to prevent youth from
encountering further harmful content.
Overall, 3 months after reading our guide, parents and
caregivers retained the vast majority of the knowledge and
skills they had learned.
Taken together, our evidence shows that it's possible to
provide communities with tools to be safer on-line. Parents,
grandparents, teachers, coaches, mental health professionals,
and others deserve help confronting an unprecedented amount of
harmful on-line content to keep their families safe and
protected.
We detail several policy recommendations in our written
testimony. Most substantially, we would like to see the U.S.
Government, like some of our allies overseas, create a central,
national, nonpartisan center for prevention to help equip local
communities with tools, evidence, and capacity-building
trainings about what works.
The crisis of domestic violent extremism that is fueled by
disinformation and propaganda cannot be solved by law
enforcement and security-based approaches alone. We must invest
in upstream strategies to keep communities safe from on-line
harms.
We seek a world in which every community is equipped with
the tools they need to reject harmful on-line propaganda,
conspiracy theories, and manipulative content without the need
for censorship, surveillance, banning, or security-based
solutions.
Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to your
questions.
[The prepared statement of Ms. Miller-Idriss follows:]
Prepared Statement of Cynthia Miller-Idriss
Thursday, May 11, 2023, 2 o'clock PM ET
Chairman Green, Ranking Member Thompson, and Members of the
committee: I would like to thank you for your service to our country
and for calling attention to the critical issue of disinformation. My
name is Cynthia Miller-Idriss, and I am a professor in the Department
of Justice, Law, and Criminology and in the School of Education at the
American University in Washington, DC, where I also direct the
Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab (PERIL)--an
applied research lab in the School of Public Affairs. I have been
studying education-based solutions to the prevention of violent
extremism, including through early prevention related to disinformation
and propaganda--for over 20 years. I want to acknowledge the support of
my research team at PERIL, whose assistance was invaluable in preparing
my testimony today.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ With gratitude to researchers and staff at American
University's Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab
(PERIL) who helped prepare this written testimony: Dr. Pasha Dashtgard,
Dr. Brian Hughes, Laura Kralicky, Wyatt Russell, and to colleagues at
the Southern Poverty Law Center for their support and partnership on
many of the intervention tools and guides cited above.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab, PERIL,
develops evidence-based initiatives--such as, short-form videos,
trainings and train-the-trainer programs, research studies, community
toolkits and guides--to build social cohesion, reverse political
polarization, and prevent violent extremism. Utilizing a public health
framework and multi-disciplinary, pre-preventative approaches, we
design, test, and scale up evidence-based tools and intervention
strategies to help people recognize and reject harmful on-line and off-
line content, propaganda, supremacist ideologies, conspiracy theories,
misinformation, and disinformation while safeguarding their freedom of
speech. As widely recognized experts and leaders in the field of
preventing extremism and radicalization, we have created effective,
evidence-based resources to inoculate against propaganda and extremist
content, as well as empower individuals to intervene and interrupt
early radicalization and keep their loved ones safe from on-line
manipulation--all as an alternative to security-based approaches that
rely on surveillance, monitoring, censorship, or banning.
PERIL's work focuses specifically on equipping people with tools to
recognize on-line manipulation in order to protect themselves and their
loved ones from disinformation that seeks to harm them (see below for
definitions of disinformation and related terms). We do not teach
people what to think; our work is nonpartisan and rooted in evidence.
Our focus is on responding to community needs and on providing
resources to help people understand the kinds of persuasive techniques
that bad actors often use to manipulate others. For example, foreign
influence operations, domestic and international extremist and
terrorist groups, and scammers seeking a profit will often use
rhetorical strategies, propaganda, and emotional tactics that are
designed and used to convince others to believe, think, or act in a
specific manner. These persuasive techniques manipulate observers for
the purposes of grooming, recruiting, and building support for violent
ideologies, tactics, strategies, or actions. Our research has
demonstrated with consistent statistical significance that people can
learn to recognize persuasive and manipulative tactics in order to make
more informed choices in their lives, especially on-line.
scope and scale: communities in need
The national crisis facing communities across the country is all
too evident. Over the past 3 years, PERIL has fielded a constant stream
of emails and calls from individuals and communities across the
country--all asking for help confronting the impacts of disinformation
and propaganda in their lives. In Michigan, a grandfather and military
veteran wrote to ask what he could do about his grandson, who had
joined an armed militia. In Texas, faith leaders asked for ways to
support pastors whose congregations were torn apart by partisan
polarization and conspiracy theories. In Washington State, a local
government needed training for city employees to prevent polarization
and reject on-line manipulation. In Vermont, a local entrepreneur asked
if the school system could do more to ensure that his future
employees--most of whom he hired straight from the local high school--
would stop espousing so much propaganda and conspiracy theories, which
had become a problem for his business. A local mom wanted help with her
middle school son, who during the pandemic had consumed so much on-line
misogyny that he said he did not need to respect her authority as a
parent, because she is a woman.
These stories illustrate what research evidence has also
demonstrated: We face a national crisis rooted in the rampant
circulation of propaganda, dis/mis and malinformation, and other
harmful on-line content. American communities are coming to us because
they feel threatened by on-line disinformation. Some fall prey to
hostile foreign influence operations by people who try to manipulate
Americans for profit or to disrupt our democratic process. People give
their bank information to scammers pretending to be from the IRS.
Teenagers share intimate details of their lives with people on-line who
they think are friends their own age, but who are not. Others come to
believe propaganda and disinformation that lures them into what they
think is heroic action to save their racial or ethnic group after going
down rabbit holes of antisemitic conspiracies about demographic change
and a supposed orchestrated replacement of white people.
The data on this is clear. The pace, scope, and scale of violent
extremism have probably increased and are escalating rapidly. The Anti-
Defamation League reports that white supremacist propaganda efforts are
at the highest level they have ever recorded, jumping 38 percent above
2021 levels to 6,751 reported cases in 2022.\2\ These incidents include
distribution of racist, antisemitic, and anti-LGBTQIA+ fliers, graffiti
and posters, stickers, banners, and laser projections that have heavily
targeted houses of worship and other community institutions.

2021.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The repercussions of so much circulation of propaganda, conspiracy
theories, and disinformation are abundantly clear. Between 2013 and
2021, the number of open domestic terrorism-related cases in the United
States jumped 357 percent to 9,049 cases, with the most violent
incidents being committed by racially or ethnically motivated violent
extremists during the same years.\3\ Of the 444 people killed by
extremism in the United States between 2013 and 2022, the significant
majority of deaths were at the hands of right-wing extremists (335
deaths, or 75 percent).\4\ Of those killed by right-wing extremists in
2021, 73 percent were affiliated with white supremacy, 5 percent with
incel/toxic masculinity extremism, and 17 percent with anti-Government
extremism.\5\ The 2022 racist shooting that killed 10 people in a
grocery store in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Buffalo,
motivated by the false Great Replacement conspiracy theory, is just one
tragic recent example.

Non-lethal attacks have also risen significantly. More than 50 bomb
threats were made to HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and
Universities) and predominantly Black churches in 2022. And the problem
goes well beyond white supremacist extremism.\6\ Antisemitism,
conspiracy theories, anti-LGBTQ+ hate, and misogynistic content has
spiked across on-line platforms. Before he was banned from social media
platforms in mid-2022, violent and deeply misogynistic videos from one
content creator were viewed 12 billion times on TikTok alone.\7\
Violent outcomes often show a toxic mix of ideological hatred. Just
this week, 8 people lost their lives at a Texas shopping mall at the
hands of a man with a swastika tattoo who had posted both violent
misogynistic and neo-Nazi content on-line.

In October 2020, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security under
President Trump issued a threat assessment report declaring domestic
violent extremism in general and white supremacist extremists (WSEs) in
particular the ``most persistent and lethal threat in the
Homeland.''\8\ The Biden administration issued a similar assessment in
spring 2021,\9\ followed by the first-ever national strategy to counter
domestic terrorism, noting the rising threat from white supremacist
extremism and anti-Government and unlawful militias that threaten
civilians, elected officials, and democratic institutions.\10\ Much of
this violence is motivated by disinformation, propaganda, and
conspiracy theories. According to the Global Terrorism Database,
terrorist attacks motivated by conspiracy theory extremists were
responsible for 119 attacks in 2020--a jump from 6 attacks the year
before--in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Canada, United
Kingdom and Germany.\11\ Meanwhile, hate crimes in the United States
are at the highest level in decades,\12\ despite persistent
underreporting. In sum, the United States and our allies have seen
rising violent extremism and hate-fueled and political violence fueled
by antisemitism, conspiracy theories, propaganda, disinformation, and
other harmful on-line content as a pattern of violence that has been
escalating for years.

what works to prevent and counter disinformation
The good news is there is a growing body of evidence about what
works to equip the public with tools that shore up their capacity to
intervene in pathways to violent extremism, while protecting their
right to free speech and reducing the need for security-based
approaches. We have found that it only takes 7-12 minutes of reading
one of our intervention guides for its audience to be significantly
better informed about harmful on-line content and the risks of
radicalization to violence; to feel more empowered and confident about
intervening; to build their own capability to intervene; and to know
where to get more help.* This is the case across our research with
parents and caregivers, including grandparents, uncles, and cousins;
with educators and youth mentors; with local governments and small
businesses, and more. For example, in just 12 minutes of reading one of
our intervention tools, 85 percent of our participants understood the
process by which youth become radicalized, and 83 percent felt that
they knew where to get help if they suspect a young person to be
engaging in extremist ideas.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Importantly, across our work, we found that both prior to and after
reading our parents and caregivers guide, Democrats and Republicans did
not significantly differ in their knowledge of extremism. Republicans
scored significantly better (5 percent better) than Democrats did in
terms of knowledge of extremism after having read the guide, and
members of both political parties reported being satisfied with the
guide's contents and equally willing to intervene with a young person
they suspect is coming into contact with radicalizing content. We have
also found that education alone doesn't solve our problem of
disinformation. Our research has shown that higher levels of education
do not necessarily mean people have the skills to consistently
recognize harmful manipulation tactics on-line. On the contrary--we
found that parents with higher levels of education were overconfident
in their ability to help children distinguish trustworthy and
untrustworthy news sources. After reading our guide, their confidence
went down as they realized how tricky on-line disinformation and
harmful content can be.
There is also strong emerging evidence that even short
interventions can have a lasting impact on local communities. We are
currently studying a group of 1,500 parents and caregivers in 3-month
intervals for a full year after reading our intervention tool. Three
months after reading our guide for parents and caregivers, over 11
percent (135 individuals) of respondents said that after the
intervention, they either joined or created a group that discusses
issues of youth radicalization and extremism. Six percent of our
participants, or about 75 people, told us that within the 3 months
after reading our guide, they used what they learned to take direct
action to prevent youth from radicalizing further or being recruited
through additional on-line manipulation. Overall, 3 months after
reading our guide, parents and caregiver retained the vast majority of
the knowledge and skills they had learned. Seventy-five percent of
participants reported understanding the process by which youth become
radicalized on-line--a 23 percent increase from the initial survey--and
70 percent felt prepared to talk with youth about on-line extremism--
only a 5 percent drop from the initial survey. Over a third of
participants told us they had shared or used the information with their
biological children, while nearly 13 percent shared it with other young
people in their family, including grandchildren, nephews and nieces,
and cousins.
Taken together, our evidence shows that it is possible to provide
communities with tools to be safer on-line. Parents, grandparents,
teachers, coaches, mental health professionals, and others deserve help
confronting an unprecedented amount of harmful on-line content and
being more confident and capable to keep their families safe and
protected from harmful on-line content. All communities need
information and tangible action steps for how to help their loved ones
resist manipulative rhetoric, propaganda, conspiracy theories, and
disinformation they are exposed to on-line and off-line in ways that
help them make better choices while avoiding censorship, surveillance,
monitoring, or other security-based approaches.
adopting a public health approach
PERIL advocates for a holistic public-health mode of prevention
consisting of investments at the primary, secondary, and tertiary
prevention levels to prevent violent extremism and the components that
contribute to it, including disinformation and propaganda. Primary
prevention refers to efforts to address radicalization before it takes
root, including through broad civic education and media literacy
focused on helping the public build resilience in ways that do not
infringe on their right to free speech or free association, and that
work as an alternative to security-based approaches that surveil,
monitor, censor, or ban content. Secondary prevention refers to efforts
to mitigate the impacts of already radicalized people and groups,
primarily through surveillance, monitoring, arrests, and interruption
of plots. Tertiary prevention refers to focused deradicalization
efforts, including through prison deradicalization programs and
``exit''-type counseling services that help radicalized individuals
disengage from extremism.
An effective public health approach to countering disinformation
builds prevention and intervention across all three of those levels--
with the significant majority of efforts and resources on the primary
prevention side--and would require four things. First, it must be
nimble and responsive to communities' needs depending on regional areas
of concern. Second, it must be holistic and whole-of-community in ways
that broaden engagement of a wide range of government offices,
agencies, and organizations beyond the security and law enforcement
sectors, such as the education, health and human services, and mental
health sectors. It would include primary prevention efforts through the
arts, community organizations, faith communities, or other community-
based non-profits. Third, an effective public-health prevention model
rests on evidence at all levels of intervention. This means moving
beyond outcome evaluations that describe only outputs, or the numbers
of people trained, the numbers of downloads of a particular tool, or
other descriptive metrics that do not actually provide evidence of
impact. Finally, a holistic public health approach focuses on building
resilient systems as well as resilient individuals. Resilience to
propaganda and disinformation is not merely a technical skill, in other
words: it is also rooted in national and community values and
commitment to an inclusive democracy that must be reinforced,
emphasized, and modeled in all aspects of life across the life course.
The aim is to reduce the fertile ground in which disinformation,
propaganda, hate, and anti-democratic ideas thrive.
This is a vision of a public health-style prevention system that
works to prevent violence and counter harm while simultaneously
promoting concrete steps toward inclusive equity, respect, coexistence,
and real and symbolic recognition of difference. Such a prevention
system gives us the best chance of building community social cohesion,
reducing violent outcomes, and strengthening our democracies.
policy recommendations
1. Invest in a holistic, community-based, public-health approach to
preventing the spread of supremacist ideologies, mis/dis/
malinformation, conspiracy theories, and propaganda. This
includes creating avenues to fund both pilot testing of
innovative approaches, followed by national scale-up of what is
proven to be effective in primary-level prevention strategies,
including digital literacy and civic education that equips
educators, parents and caregivers, youth mentors, faith
leaders, coaches, mental health counselors, and others with
better tools to recognize and ``offramp'' individuals who are
persuaded by disinformation from further radicalization to
violence. The Federal Government can support the creation of
impact-driven networks that bring together government agencies
from well beyond the security sector; civil society
institutions like schools, mental health professionals, sports
leagues and after-school programs; local NGO's and advocacy
efforts that enhance community wellness; and others. At the
local level, people need to hear and see pathways for their own
engagement, to spark their imaginations about ways to act, to
be moved to change their behaviors, to know there are resources
to support their learning, and to want to know more in ways
that make a difference in their families' and communities'
well-being.
2. Incentivize and prioritize rigorous impact assessment and
evaluation frameworks to ensure policies and programs are
implemented as intended and are effective beyond descriptive
metrics. Evaluation frameworks and results funded with public
dollars should be made publicly available to ensure
transparency and reduce the need for every initiative to
reinvent the wheel.
3. Ensure that prevention initiatives focus on equipping the public
with better tools for their own decision making, while not
interfering with any individual's freedom of speech,
conscience, or association. We cannot repeat the mistakes of
historical civil liberties violations or promote censorship as
a solution to disinformation.
4. Continue to work with the tech sector to remove harmful and
dangerous content, while understanding that banning and content
removal is an after-the-fact solution that does not, on its
own, solve the crisis of disinformation and propaganda.
Addressing the problem of disinformation must begin with
upstream prevention that reduces the production of and
receptivity to harmful content to begin with.
5. Create a central, national, nonpartisan center for prevention to
provide Federal, State, and local governments and all local
communities with tools, resources, training, capacity-building,
and evidence about what works.
definitions
We define disinformation as false, untrue, or incorrect information
spread to intentionally deceive, manipulate, misinform, and erode an
individual or group's belief of established facts, often with a
specific interest or goal. This includes efforts from hostile foreign
influence operations, profiteers, and international extremist and
terrorist groups who aim to harm American democracy, U.S. elections, or
scam unsuspecting Americans for profit. It also includes domestic
efforts that undermine inclusive democracy, such as antisemitism or
anti-immigrant conspiracy theories, or compromise the physical health
and well-being of communities. Disinformation is similar but distinct
from misinformation, which is the unintentional sharing of false or
incorrect information or untrue claims spread without the aim to
deceive, manipulate, or harm. It also differs from malinformation,
which refers to true claims spread with the intent to deceive,
manipulate, or harm. Propaganda refers to manipulative persuasive
techniques that seek to make people believe true or untrue information,
or values and opinions, sometimes using dis/mis/malinformation,
persuasive narratives (stories that help audiences imagine themselves
as heroes, villains, victors, or victims), or rhetoric (emotionally
stirring language, image, and sounds), which lend manipulative power.
Extremism is the belief that one group of people is in dire conflict
with other groups who don't share the same racial or ethnic, gender or
sexual, religious, or political identity. This ``us'' versus ``them''
framework positions the ``other'' as an existential threat and calls
for total separation, domination, or other forms of violence.
Notably, terrorist violence from domestic violent extremists does
not usually link back to specific groups. Instead, it's most often
perpetrated by individuals who have experienced networked on-line
radicalization through exposure to propaganda. Groups are still an
important source of much of the propaganda that circulates in extremist
scenes and subcultures, including on-line. Finally, it is important to
note that the spread of on-line propaganda and disinformation is fueled
by how people spend time on-line. On-line radicalization happens in
part when people spend time in echo chambers, where extreme content is
self-reinforcing across platforms. There is also significant
algorithmic radicalization through recommendation systems that suggest
content that is related, but more salacious or more extreme than the
content the viewer just watched. This can lead to ``rabbit holes'' of
disinformation, conspiracy theories and propaganda consumption that are
difficult to climb out of.
conclusion
The crisis of domestic violent extremism that is fueled by
disinformation and propaganda cannot be solved by law enforcement and
security-based approaches. We must invest in upstream strategies to
keep communities safe from on-line harms. We seek a world in which
every community is equipped with the tools they need to reject harmful
on-line propaganda, conspiracy theories, and manipulative content
without the need for censorship, surveillance, banning, or security-
based solutions. Thank you for your attention and I look forward to
your questions.

Mr. Bishop. Thank you, Dr. Miller-Idriss.
I now recognize Professor Turley for his 5-minute opening
statement.

STATEMENT OF JONATHAN TURLEY, SHAPIRO CHAIR FOR PUBLIC INTEREST
LAW, THE GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY

Mr. Turley. Thank you, Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member
Ivey, Members of the subcommittee. It's an honor to be before
you today and also to participate with my esteemed co-
witnesses.
This is obviously a question of tremendous importance to
all of us. We all love our country, and I believe we all love
free speech, and we have to find a way to talk to each other to
find a way to deal with our rivaling concerns.
From my perspective, I've been an advocate for free speech
my entire life. Some people have even called me an absolutist
of free speech. There was a time when that was a compliment,
but I admit that I do resist most efforts to regulate speech.
What we have seen thus far--and we've only seen a fraction
of the complex of censorship in the U.S. Government--is a
censorship system of breathtaking size. We've seen only a
fraction through the Twitter Files, through some hearings, and
some litigation.
From the free speech community, it's like a game of whack-
a-mole. Every time we deal with a disinformation office that
raises concerns, we find out that there are five others.
One of the things I have emphasized in my testimony is that
I think people of good faith can come together to at least say
that we need to know the full scope of the disinformation
system we have in the Government. We can debate.
I really took to heart the Ranking Member's comments about
finding solutions here. We can look at those solutions. But we
also need to look at what's the current effort thus far in
terms of speech regulation, censorship, and blacklisting.
Many of these grants, many of these programs are straight
blacklisting programs. They are to identify people, to
discourage in some cases advertisers from supporting sites.
This is money coming from the U.S. Government to support these
types of efforts, and that's deeply problematic.
Many of these efforts are not just to remove people, but to
isolate them. The recent disclosures of LinkedIn as engaging in
censorship is an example of that.
As an academic, I've seen this. It's an honor to appear
with one of our esteemed scientific academics who was the
subject of censorship. But the idea is to isolate people, to
chill their speech. It's working. It's succeeding.
Now, the whole point of much of my testimony is to look at
what the legal standards are, how far the Government can go
without tripping the wire of the First Amendment, but more
importantly, to what extent this damages free speech.
The courts have emphasized over and over again that the
Government cannot enlist agents to do indirectly what they are
prohibited from doing directly. I believe that is what we're
seeing today.
The collateral harm is considerable. People talk about
speech as harmful. So is censorship. When you censor people
like my esteemed colleague from Harvard, you are denying a
public debate about public health issues, issues like, did we
need to close our schools?
We're facing a terrible psychological and educational
crisis that is linked to the shutdowns of the pandemic. We're
now debating that when we should have been debating this at the
time.
Those are costs. Those are costs that come from censorship.
Now, in my testimony I explore the cases that admittedly
have a difficult time of when the Government trips this wire
under the First Amendment. I'd be happy to talk about that
today.
I obviously am very critical of CISA's idea that it is
supposed to be regulating the cognitive infrastructure. That
Orwellian notion really sends people like me into a tight fetal
position. The fact is we don't need the Government looking at
our cognitive anything, whether it's the infrastructure or not.
Recently, an English court found someone guilty of toxic
ideology. That is a sort of cognitive infrastructure problem. I
hope we don't go in that direction.
MDM is designed to give the maximal space for censorship.
It is something I hope this committee will turn its back on.
Many of us welcome a debate that will come when we know the
full extent of these efforts, but let it be an open and honest
debate. Let's understand what has been done. Then we can
debate, as citizens that love this country, the type of
solutions the Ranking Member spoke of.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
As I recently testified before the House Judiciary Committee, the
growing evidence of censorship and blacklisting efforts by the
Government raises serious and troubling questions over our protection
of free speech.\6\ There are legitimate disagreements on how Congress
should address the role of the Government in such censorship. The first
step, however, is to fully understand the role played in prior years
and to address the deep-seated doubts of many Americans concerning the
actions of the Government to stifle or sanction speech.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\6\ Some of today's testimony is material included from that
earlier hearing. ``Hearing on the Weaponization of the Federal
Government,'' U.S. House of Representatives, House Judiciary Committee,

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Twitter Files and other recent disclosures raise serious
questions of whether the United States Government is now a partner in
what may be the largest censorship system in our history. That
involvement cuts across the Executive branch, with confirmed
coordination with agencies ranging from the Homeland Security to the
State Department to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Even
based on our limited knowledge, the size of this censorship system is
breathtaking, and we only know of a fraction of its operations through
the Twitter Files, Congressional hearings, and pending litigation. Most
of the information has come from the Twitter Files after the purchase
of the company by Elon Musk. Notably, Twitter has 450 million active
users \7\ but it is still only ranked 15th in the number of users,
after companies such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, and
Pinterest.\8\ The assumption is that the Government censorship program
dovetailed with these other companies, which continue to refuse to
share past communications or work with the Government. Assuming these
efforts extended to the larger platforms, we have a Government-
supported censorship system that is unparalleled in history.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
We now have undeniable evidence of a comprehensive system of
censorship that stretches across the government, academia, and
corporate realms. Through disinformation offices, grants, and other
means, an array of Federal agencies has been active ``stakeholders'' in
this system. This includes Homeland Security, State Department, the
FBI, and other Federal agencies actively seeking the censorship of
citizens and groups.
The partners in this effort extend across social media platforms.
The goal is not just to remove dissenting views, but also to isolate
those citizens who voice them. We recently learned that this effort
extended even to companies like LinkedIn.\9\ New emails uncovered in
the Missouri v. Biden litigation reportedly show that the Biden
administration's censorship efforts extended to Facebook to censor
private communications on its WhatsApp messaging service.\10\ The
effort to limit access, even to professional sites like LinkedIn,
creates a chilling effect on those who would challenge majoritarian or
official views. It was the same chilling effect experienced by
scientists who tried to voice alternative views on vaccines, school
closures, masks, or the COVID origins. The success of this partnership
may surpass anything achieved by direct state-run systems in countries
like Russia or China.

The recent disclosures involving the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is chillingly familiar. It is
part of an ever-expanding complex of Government programs and grants
directed toward the censorship or blacklisting of citizens and groups.
In just a matter of weeks, the size of this complex has come into
greater focus and has confirmed the fears held by many of us over the
use of private actors to do indirectly what the Government is
prohibited from doing directly. I have called it ``censorship by
surrogate'' and CISA appears to be the latest agency to enlist private
proxy actors.
The focus of this hearing is particularly welcomed, as it reminds
us that the cost of censorship is not just the loss of the right to
free expression. Those costs can include the impact of reducing needed
public debate and scrutiny in areas like public health. For years,
Government and corporate figures worked to silence scientists and
researchers who opposed Government policies on mask efficacy, universal
vaccinations, school closures, and even the origin of COVID-19. Leading
experts Drs. Jayanta Bhattacharya (Stanford University) and Martin
Kulldorff (Harvard University) as well as a host of others, faced
overwhelming attacks for questioning policies or views that later
proved questionable or downright wrong. Those doctors were the co-
authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, which advocated for a more
focused COVID response that targeted the most vulnerable populations,
rather than wide-spread lockdowns and mandates.
Dr. Kulldorff was censored in March 2021 when he tweeted ``Thinking
that everyone must be vaccinated is as scientifically flawed as
thinking that nobody should. COVID vaccines are important for older
high-risk people and their care-takers. Those with prior natural
infection do not need it. Nor children.'' Every aspect of that tweet
was worthy of scientific and public debate. However, with the support
of political, academic, and media figures, such views were suppressed
at the very moment in which they could have made the most difference.
For example, if we had a true and open debate, we might have followed
other countries in keeping schools open for young children. Agencies
and the media now recognize that these objections had merit. We are now
experiencing an educational and mental health crisis associated with a
lockdown that might have been avoided or reduced (as in other
countries). Millions died as Government agencies enlisted companies to
silence dissenting viewpoints on best practices and approaches. We do
not know how many of those deaths or costs might have been avoided
because this debate was delayed until after the pandemic had largely
subsided.
The purpose of my testimony today is to address the legal question
of when Government support for censorship systems becomes a violation
of the First Amendment and, more broadly, when it convenes free speech
principles. To that end, I hope to briefly explore what we know, what
we do not know, and why we must know much more about the Government's
efforts to combat speech deemed misinformation, disinformation, and
malinformation (MDM).
Regardless of how one comes out on the Constitutional ramifications
of the Government's role in the censorship system, there should be no
serious debate over the dangers that Government-supported censorship
presents to our democracy. The United States Government may be
outsourcing censorship, but the impact is still inimical to the free
speech values that define this country. This should not be a matter
that divides our political parties. Free speech is the core article of
faith of all citizens in our Constitutional system. It should transcend
politics and, despite our deepening divisions, unite us all in a common
cause to protect what Justice Louis Brandeis once called ``the
indispensable right.''\11\

ii. mdm and censorship by surrogate
It is a common refrain among many supporters of corporate
censorship that the barring, suspension, or shadow banning of
individuals on social media is not a free speech problem. The reason is
that the First Amendment applies to the Government, not private
parties. As a threshold matter, it is important to stress that free
speech values are neither synonymous with, nor contained exclusively
within, the First Amendment. The First Amendment addressed the most
prevalent danger of the time in the form of direct Government
regulation and censorship of free speech and the free press. Yet, free
speech in society is impacted by both public and private conduct.
Indeed, the massive censorship system employed by social media
companies presents the greatest loss of free speech in our history.
These companies, not the Government, now control access to the
``marketplace of ideas.'' That is also a free speech threat that needs
to be taken seriously by Congress. While the Washington Post has shown
that the Russian trolling operations had virtually zero impact on our
elections,\12\ the corporate censorship of companies like Twitter and
Facebook clearly had an impact by suppressing certain stories and
viewpoints in our public discourse. It was the response to alleged
disinformation, not the disinformation itself, that manipulated the
debate and issues for voters.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The First Amendment addresses actions by the Government, but there
are certainly actions taken by these agencies to censor the views of
citizens. While one can debate whether social media executives became
effective Government agents, public employees are Government agents.
Their actions must not seek to abridge the freedom of speech. It is
possible that a systemic Government program supporting a privately-run
censorship system is sufficient to justify injunctive relief based on
the actions of dozens of Federal employees to target and seek the
suspension of citizens due to their viewpoints. However, this program
can also run afoul of the First Amendment if the corporate counterparts
in the system are considered effective Government agents themselves.
The most common example occurs under the Fourth Amendment where the
Government is sometimes viewed as acting through private security
guards or snitches performing tasks at its request.
The same agency relationship can occur under the First Amendment,
particularly on social media. The ``marketplace of ideas'' is now
largely digital. The question is whether the private bodies engaging in
censorship are truly acting independently of the Government. There is
now ample reason to question that separation. Social media companies
operate under statutory conditions and agency review. That relationship
can allow or encourage private parties to act as willing or coerced
agents in the denial of free speech. Notably, in 1946, the Court dealt
with a town run by a private corporation in Marsh v. Alabama.\13\ It
was that corporation, rather than a Government unit, that prevented
citizens from distributing religious literature on a sidewalk. However,
the Court still found that the First Amendment was violated because the
corporation was acting as a governing body. The Court held that, while
the denial of free speech rights ``took place, [in a location] held by
others than the public, [it] is not sufficient to justify the State's
permitting a corporation to govern a community of citizens so as to
restrict their fundamental liberties.''\14\

Congress has created a curious status for social media companies in
granting immunity protections in Section 230. That status and immunity
have been repeatedly threatened by Members of Congress unless social
media companies expanded censorship programs in a variety of different
areas. The demands for censorship have been reinforced by letters
threatening Congressional action. Many of those threats have centered
around removing Section 230 immunity, pursuing antitrust measures, or
other vague regulatory responses. Many of these threats have focused on
conservative sites or speakers. The language of the Section itself is
problematic in giving these companies immunity ``to restrict access to
or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be
obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or
otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is
constitutionally protected.''\15\ As Columbia Law professor Phil
Hamburger has noted, the statute appears to permit what is made
impermissible under the First Amendment:\16\ ``Congress makes explicit
that it is immunizing companies from liability for speech restrictions
that would be unconstitutional if lawmakers themselves imposed
them.''\17\ As Hamburger notes, that does not mean that the statute is
unconstitutional, particularly given the judicial rule favoring narrow
constructions to avoid unconstitutional meanings.\18\ However, there is
another lingering issue raised by the use of this power to carry out
the clear preference on ``content moderation'' of one party.

The Court has recognized that private actors can be treated as
agents of the Government under a variety of theories. Courts have found
such agency exists when the Government exercises ``coercive power'' or
``provided such significant encouragement, either overt or covert, that
the choice must in law be deemed to be that of the state.''\19\ The
Court has also held that the actions of a private party can be ``fairly
treated as that of the state itself'' where there exists a ``close
nexus between the state and the challenged action'' that a private
action ``may be fairly treated as that of the state itself.''\20\ I
will return to the case law below, but first it is useful to consider
what is currently known about the Government-corporate coordination
revealed by the Twitter Files.

I will not lay out the full array of communications revealed by
Twitter and recent litigation, but some are worth noting as
illustrative of a systemic and close coordination between the company
and Federal officials, including dozens reportedly working within the
FBI. The level of back-channel communications at one point became so
overwhelming that a Twitter executive complained that the FBI was
``probing & pushing everywhere.'' Another official referred to managing
the Government censorship referrals as a ``monumental undertaking.'' At
the same time, dozens of ex-FBI employees were hired, including former
FBI General Counsel James Baker. There were so many FBI employees that
they set up a private Slack channel and a crib sheet to allow them to
translate FBI terms into Twitter terms more easily. The Twitter Files
have led groups from the right to the left of our political spectrum to
raise alarms over a censorship system maintained by a joint Government-
corporate effort.\21\ Journalist Matt Taibbi was enlisted by Elon Musk
to present some of these files and reduced his findings to a simple
header: ``Twitter, the FBI Subsidiary.''

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
As discussed today, these disclosures show that FBI is not alone
among the Federal agencies in systemically targeting posters for
censorship. Indeed, emails reveal FBI figures, like San Francisco
Assistant Special Agent in Charge Elvis Chan, asking Twitter executives
to ``invite an OGA'' (or ``Other Government Organization'') to an
upcoming meeting. A week later, Stacia Cardille, a senior Twitter legal
executive, indicated the OGA was the CIA, an agency under strict limits
regarding domestic activities. Much of this work apparently was done
through the multi-agency Foreign Influence Task Force (FITF), which
operated secretly to censor citizens. Cardille referenced her ``monthly
(soon to be weekly) 90-minute meeting with FBI, DOJ, DHS, ODNI [Office
of the Director of National Intelligence], and industry peers on
election threats.'' She detailed long lists of tasks sent to Twitter by
Government officials. The censorship efforts reportedly included
``regular meetings'' with intelligence officials. This included an
effort to warn Twitter about a ``hack-and-leak operation'' by state
actors targeting the 2020 Presidential election. That occurred just
before the New York Post story on Hunter Biden's laptop was published
and then blocked by Twitter. It was also blocked by other social media
platforms like Facebook.\22\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\22\ Mark Zuckerberg has also stated that the FBI clearly warned
about the Hunter Biden laptop as Russian disinformation. David Molloy,

Censorship, BBC, August 26, 2022, https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-
canada-62688532.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The files also show the staggering size of Government searches and
demands. The FBI reportedly did key word searches to flag large numbers
of postings for possible referral to Twitter. On November 3, 2020,
Cardille told Baker that ``[t]he FBI has ``some folks in the Baltimore
field office and at HQ that are just doing keyword searches for
violations. This is probably the 10th request I have dealt with in the
last 5 days.'' Baker responded that it was ``odd that they are
searching for violations of our policies.'' But it was not odd at all.
Twitter had integrated both current and former FBI officials into its
network and the FBI was using the company's broadly-defined terms of
service to target a wide array of postings and posters for suspensions
and deletions.
At one point, the coordination became so tight that, in July 2020,
Chan offered to grant temporary top-secret clearance to Twitter
executives to allow for easier communications and incorporation into
the Government network.\23\ This close working relationship also
allowed the Government use of accounts covertly, reportedly with the
knowledge of Twitter. One 2017 email sent by an official from United
States Central Command (CENTCOM) requested that Twitter ``whitelist''
Arabic-language Twitter accounts that the Government was using to
``amplify certain messages.'' The Government also asked that these
accounts be granted the ``verified'' blue checkmark.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\23\ Gadde and Roth both testified that they do not know if anyone
took up this offer for clearances.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The range of available evidence on Government coordination with
censorship extends beyond the Twitter Files and involves other
agencies. For example, recent litigation brought by various States over
social media censorship revealed a back-channel exchange between
defendant Carol Crawford, the CDC's Chief of digital media and a
Twitter executive.\24\ The timing of the request for the meeting was
made on March 18, 2021. Twitter senior manager for public policy Todd
O'Boyle asked Crawford to help identify tweets to be censored and
emphasized that the company was ``looking forward to setting up regular
chats.'' However, Crawford said that the timing that week was
``tricky.'' Notably, that week, Dorsey and other CEOs were to appear at
a House hearing to discuss ``misinformation'' on social media and their
``content moderation'' policies. I had just testified on private
censorship in circumventing the First Amendment as a type of censorship
by surrogate.\25\ Dorsey and the other CEOs were asked at the March 25,
2021, hearing about my warning of a ``little brother problem, a problem
which private entities do for the Government which it cannot legally do
for itself.''\26\ Dorsey insisted that there was no such censorship
office or program.

The pressure to censor COVID-related views was also coming from the
White House, as they targeted Alex Berenson, a former New York Times
reporter, who had contested agency positions on vaccines and underlying
research. Rather than push information to counter Berenson's views, the
White House wanted him banned. Berenson was eventually suspended.
These files show not just a massive censorship system but a
coordination and integration of the Government to a degree that few
imagined before the release of the Twitter Files. Congressional
hearings have only deepened the alarm for many in the free speech
community. At one hearing, former Twitter executive Anika Collier
Navaroli testified on what she called the ``nuanced'' standard used by
her and her staff on censorship, including the elimination of ``dog
whistles'' and ``coded'' messaging. She then said that they balanced
free speech against safety and explained that they sought a different
approach:

``Instead of asking just free speech versus safety to say free speech
for whom and public safety for whom. So whose free expression are we
protecting at the expense of whose safety and whose safety are we
willing to allow to go the winds so that people can speak freely?''

The statement was similar to the statement of the former CEO Parag
Agrawal. After taking over as CEO, Agrawal pledged to regulate content
as ``reflective of things that we believe lead to a healthier public
conversation.'' Agrawal said the company would ``focus less on thinking
about free speech'' because ``speech is easy on the internet. Most
people can speak. Where our role is particularly emphasized is who can
be heard.''
The sweeping standards revealed at these hearings were defended by
Members as necessary to avoid ``insurrections'' and other social harms.
What is particularly distressing is to hear Members repeatedly
defending censorship by citing Oliver Wendell Holmes' famous statement
on ``shouting fire in a crowded theater.'' This mantra has been grossly
misused as a justification for censorship. From statements on the
pandemic to climate change, anti-free speech advocates are claiming
that opponents are screaming ``fire'' and causing panic. The line comes
from Schenck v. United States, a case that discarded the free speech
rights of citizens opposing the draft. Charles Schenck and Elizabeth
Baer were leading socialists in Philadelphia who opposed the draft in
World War I. Fliers were distributed that encouraged men to ``assert
your rights'' and stand up for their right to refuse such conscription
as a form of involuntary servitude. Writing for the Court, Justice
Oliver Wendell Holmes dismissed the free speech interests in protecting
the war and the draft. He then wrote the most regrettable and
misunderstood judicial soundbites in history: ``the character of every
act depends on the circumstances in which it is done . . . The most
stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely
shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic.'' ``Shouting fire in a
crowded theater'' quickly became a mantra for every effort to curtail
free speech.
Holmes sought to narrow his clear and present danger test in his
dissent in Abrams v. United States. He warned that ``we should be
eternally vigilant against attempts to check the expression of opinions
that we loath and believe to be frought (sic) with death, unless they
so imminently threaten immediate interference with the lawful and
pressing purposes of the law that at an immediate check is required to
save the country.'' Holmes' reframing of his view would foreshadow the
standard in Brandenburg v. Ohio, where the Supreme Court ruled that
even calling for violence is protected under the First Amendment unless
there is a threat of ``imminent lawless action and is likely to incite
or produce such action.'' However, Members are still channeling the
standard from Schenck, which is a curious choice for most Democrats in
using a standard used against socialists and anti-war protesters.
Even more unnerving is the fact that Navaroli's standard and those
referencing terms like ``delegitimization'' makes the Schenck standard
look like the model of clarity. Essentially, they add that you also
have to consider the theater, movie, and audience to decide what speech
to allow. What could be treated as crying ``Fire!'' by any given person
or in any given circumstances would change according to their
``nuanced'' judgment.
iii. cisa within the government-corporate alliance
The role of CISA in this complex of Government-corporate programs
only recently came into closer scrutiny. The Department of Homeland
Security was previously the focus of public controversy with the
disclosure of the creation of Department's Disinformation Governance
Board and the appointment of Nina Jankowicz, its head.
Jankowicz was a long advocate for censorship in the name of
combating disinformation. At the time, White House press secretary Jen
Psaki described the board as intended ``to prevent disinformation and
misinformation from traveling around the country in a range of
communities.''\27\ While the Department ultimately yielded to the
public outcry over the board and disbanded it, the public was never
told of a wide array other offices doing much of the same work in
targeting citizens and groups for possible censorship.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In January 2017, the Homeland Security declared that election
infrastructure would be treated as ``critical infrastructure.'' CISA
took a lead in supporting election infrastructure integrity and
countering election misinformation. In 2018, CISA and its Countering
Foreign Influence Task Force (CFITF) reportedly assumed a greater role
in monitoring and counteracting foreign interference in U.S. elections.
In 2020, this work appears to have expanded further to pursue
allegations of ``switch boarding'' by domestic actors, or individuals
thought to be acting as conduits for information undermining elections
or critical infrastructure. Much about this work remains unclear and I
am no expert on CISA or its operational profile. However, the expanding
mandate of CISA follows a strikingly familiar pattern.
The Twitter Files references CISA participation in these
coordination meetings.
Given a mandate to help protect election integrity, CISA plunged
into the monitoring and targeting of those accused of disinformation.
Infrastructure was interpreted to include speech. As its director, Jen
Easterly, declared ``the most critical infrastructure is our cognitive
infrastructure'' and thus included ``building that resilience to
misinformation and disinformation, I think, is incredibly
important.''\28\ She pledged to continue that work with the private
sector including social media companies on that effort. We do not need
the Government in the business of building our ``cognitive
infrastructure.'' Like content moderation, the use of this euphemism
does not disguise the Government's effort to direct and control what
citizens may read or say on public platforms.

Over the years, the range of information deemed harmful has
expanded to the point that even true information is now viewed as
harmful for the purposes of censorship. Some of the recent disclosures
from Twitter highlighted the work of Stanford's Virality Project which
insisted ``true stories . . . could fuel hesitancy'' over taking the
vaccine or other measures.\29\ It is reminiscent of the sedition
prosecutions under the Crown before the American revolution where truth
was no defense. Even true statements could be viewed as seditious and
criminal. Once the Government gets into the business of speech
regulation, the appetite for censorship becomes insatiable as
viewpoints are deemed harmful, even if true. CISA shows the same broad
range of suspect speech:

MDM regulations offer the Government the maximal space for
censorship based on how information may be received or used. The
inclusion of true material used to ``manipulate'' others is
particularly chilling as a rationale for speech controls.
According to the Election Integrity Partnership (EIP), ``tickets''
flag material for investigation that can be ``one piece of content, an
idea or narrative, or hundreds of URLs pulled in a data dump.''\31\
These tickets reportedly include those suspected of
``delegitimization,'' which includes speech that undermines or spread
distrust in the political or electoral system. The ill-defined
character of these categories is by design. It allows for highly
selective or biased ``ticketing'' of speech. The concern is that
conservative writers or sites subjected to the greatest targeting or
ticketing. This pattern was evident in other recent disclosures from
private bodies working with U.S. agencies. For example, we recently
learned that the U.S. State Department funding for the National
Endowment for Democracy (NED) included support for the Global
Disinformation Index (GDI).\32\ The British group sought to discourage
advertisers from supporting sites deemed dangerous due to
disinformation. Companies were warned by GDI about ``risky'' sites that
pose ``reputational and brand risk'' and asked them to avoid
``financially supporting disinformation on-line.'' All ten of the
``riskiest'' sites identified by the GDI are popular with
conservatives, libertarians, and independents, including Reason, a site
featuring legal analysis of conservative law professors. Liberal sites
like HuffPost were ranked as the most trustworthy. The categories were
as ill-defined as those used by CISA. RealClearPolitics was blacklisted
due to what GDI considers ``biased and sensational language.'' The New
York Post was blacklisted because ``content sampled from the Post
frequently displayed bias, sensationalism, and clickbait, which carries
the risk of misleading the site's reader.'' After the biased
blacklisting was revealed, NED announced that it would withdraw funding
for the organization. However, as with the Disinformation Board, the
Disinformation Index was just one of a myriad of groups being funded or
fed information from Federal agencies. These controversies have created
a type of ``Whack-a-mole'' challenge for the free speech community.
Every time one censorship partnership is identified and neutralized,
another one pops up.

EIP embodies this complex of groups working with agencies. It
describes itself as an organization that ``was formed between four of
the Nation's leading institutions focused on understanding
misinformation and disinformation in the social media landscape: the
Stanford Internet Observatory, the University of Washington's Center
for an Informed Public, Graphika, and the Atlantic Council's Digital
Forensic Research Lab.'' The EIP has referred to CISA as one of its
``stakeholders'' and CISA has used the partnership to censor
individuals or groups identified by the agency. We still do not the
full extent of the coordination between CISA and other agencies with
private and academic groups in carrying out censorship efforts.
However, the available evidence raises legitimate questions over an
agency relationship for the purposes of the First Amendment.
iv. outsourcing censorship: the need for greater transparency and
accountability
In recent years, a massive censorship complex has been established
with Government, academic, and corporate components. Millions of posts
and comments are now being filtered through this system in arguably the
most sophisticated censorship system in history. This partnership was
facilitated by the demands of the First Amendment, which bars the
Government from directly engaging in forms of prior restraint and
censorship. If ``necessity is the mother of invention,'' the censorship
complex shows how inventive motivated people can be in circumventing
the Constitution. It has been an unprecedented challenge for the free
speech community. The First Amendment was designed to deal with the
classic threat to free speech of a Government-directed system of
censorship. However, the traditional model of a ministry of information
is now almost quaint in comparison to the current system. It is
possible to have an effective state media by consent rather than
coercion. There is no question that the work of these academic and
private groups limits free speech. Calling opposing views
disinformation, malinformation, or misinformation does not sanitize the
censorship. It is still censorship being conducted through a screen of
academic and corporate entities. It may also contravene the First
Amendment.
The Government can violate the Constitution through public
employees or private actors. As I testified recently before the
Judiciary Committee, this agency relationship can be established
through consent or coercion. Indeed, the line can be difficult to
discern in many cases. There is an argument that this is a violation of
the First Amendment.
Where the earlier debate over the status of these companies under
Section 230 remained mired in speculation, the recent disclosures of
Government involvement in the Twitter censorship program presents a
more compelling and concrete case for arguing agency theories. These
emails refer to multiple agencies with dozens of employees actively
coordinating the blacklisting and blocking of citizens due to their
public statements.
There is no question that the United States Government is actively
involved in a massive censorship system. The only question is whether
it is in violation of the First Amendment.
Once again, the Twitter Files show direct action from Federal
employees to censor viewpoints and individual speakers on social media.
The Government conduct is direct and clear. That may alone be
sufficient to satisfy courts that a program or policy abridges free
speech under the First Amendment. Even if a company like Twitter
declined occasionally, the Federal Government was actively seeking to
silence citizens. Any declinations only show that that effort was not
always successful.
In addition to that direct action, the Government may also be
responsible for the actions of third parties who are partnering with
the Government on censorship. The Government has long attempted to use
private parties to evade direct limits imposed by the Constitution.
Indeed, this tactic has been part of some of the worst chapters in our
history. For example, in Lombard v. Louisiana,\33\ the Supreme Court
dealt with the denial of a restaurant to serve three Black students and
one white student at a lunch counter in New Orleans reserved for white
people. The Court acknowledged that there was no State statute or city
ordinance requiring racial segregation in restaurants. However, both
the Mayor and the Superintendent of Police had made public statements
that ``sit-in demonstrations'' would not be permitted. The Court held
that the Government cannot do indirectly what it cannot do directly. In
other words, it ``cannot achieve the same result by an official command
which has at least as much coercive effect as an ordinance.''\34\

As the Court saidg in Blum v. Yaretsky (where state action was not
found), ``a state normally can be held responsible for a private
decision only when it has exercised coercive power or has provided such
significant encouragement, either overt or covert, that the choice must
in law be deemed to be that of the state.''\35\ Past cases (often
dealing with state action under the Fourteenth Amendment) have produced
different tests for establishing an agency relationship, including (1)
public function; (2) joint action; (3) Governmental compulsion or
coercion; and (4) Governmental nexus.\36\ Courts have noted that these
cases ``overlap'' in critical respects.\37\ I will not go into each of
these tests but they show the highly contextual analysis performed by
courts in finding private conduct taken at the behest or direction of
the Government. The Twitter Files show a multilayered incorporation of
Government information, access, and personnel in the censorship
program. One question is ``whether the state has so far insinuated
itself into a position of interdependence with [the private entity]
that it must be recognized as a joint participant in the challenged
activity.''\38\ Nevertheless, the Supreme Court noted in Blum that
``[m]ere approval of or acquiescence in the initiatives of a private
party is not sufficient to justify holding the state responsible for
those initiatives.''\39\

Courts have previously rejected claims of agency by private parties
over social media.\40\ However, these cases often cited that lack of
evidence of coordination and occurred before the release of the Twitter
Files. For example, in Rogalinski v. Meta Platforms, Inc.,\41\ the
court rejected a claim that Meta Platforms, Inc. violated the First
Amendment when it censored posts about COVID-19. However, the claim was
based entirely on a statement by the White House Press Secretary and
``all of the alleged censorship against Rogalinski occurred before any
Government statement.'' It noted that there was no evidence that there
was any input of the Government to challenge the assertion that Meta's
message was ``entirely its own.''\42\

There is an interesting comparison to the decision of the United
States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Paige v. Coyner where
the Court dealt with the termination of an employee after a county
official called her employer to complain about comments made in a
public hearing.\43\ The court recognized that ``[t]his so-called state-
actor requirement becomes particularly complicated in cases such as the
present one where a private party is involved in inflicting the alleged
injury on the plaintiff.''\44\ However, in reversing the lower court,
it still found state action due to the fact that a Government official
made the call to the employer, which prompted the termination.

Likewise, in Dossett v. First State Bank, the United States Court
of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit ruled that the termination of a bank
employee was the result of state action after school board members
contacted her employer about comments made at a public-school board
meeting.\45\ The Eighth Circuit ruled that the district court erred by
instructing a jury that it had to find that the school board members
had ``actual authority'' to make these calls. In this free speech case,
the court held that you could have state action under the color of law
when the ``school official who was purporting to act in the performance
of official duties but was acting outside what a reasonable person
would believe the school official was authorized to do.''\46\ In this
case, Federal officials are clearly acting in their official capacity.
Indeed, that official capacity is part of the concern raised by the
Twitter Files: the assignment of dozens of Federal employees to support
a massive censorship system.

Courts have also ruled that there is state action where Government
officials use their positions to intimidate or pressure private parties
to limit free speech. In National Rifle Association v. Vullo, the
United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that a free
speech claim could be made on the basis of a state official's
pressuring companies not to do business with the NRA.\47\ The Second
Circuit held ``although Government officials are free to advocate for
(or against) certain viewpoints, they may not encourage suppression of
protected speech in a manner that `can reasonably be interpreted as
intimating that some form of punishment or adverse regulatory action
will follow the failure to accede to the official's request.' ''\48\ It
is also important to note that pressure is not required to establish an
agency relationship under three of the prior tests. It can be based on
consent rather than coercion.

We have seen how censorship efforts began with claims of foreign
interference and gradually expanded into general efforts to target harm
or ``delegitimizing'' speech. The Twitter Files show FBI officials
warning Twitter executives that their platform was being targeted by
foreign powers, including a warning that an executive cited as a basis
for blocking postings related to the Hunter Biden laptop. At the same
time, various Members of Congress have warned social media companies
that they could face legislative action if they did not continue to
censor social media. Indeed, after Twitter began to reinstate free
speech protections and dismantle its censorship program, Rep. Schiff
(joined by Reps. Andre Carson (D-Ind.), Kathy Castor (D-Fla.) and Sen.
Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.)) sent a letter to Facebook, warning it not
to relax its censorship efforts. The letter reminded Facebook that some
lawmakers are watching the company ``as part of our on-going oversight
efforts''--and suggested they may be forced to exercise that oversight
into any move by Facebook to ``alter or rollback certain misinformation
policies.'' This is only the latest such warning. In prior hearings,
social media executives were repeatedly told that a failure to remove
viewpoints were considered ``disinformation.'' For example, in a
November 2020 Senate hearing, then-Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey apologized
for censoring the Hunter Biden laptop story. But Sen. Richard
Blumenthal, D-Conn., warned that he and his Senate colleagues would not
tolerate any ``backsliding or retrenching'' by ``failing to take action
against dangerous disinformation.''\49\ Senators' demands increased
censorship in areas ranging from the pandemic to elections to climate
change.

These warnings do not necessarily mean that a court would find that
executives were carrying out Government priorities. An investigation is
needed to fully understand the coordination and the communications
between the Government and these companies. In Brentwood Academy v.
Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Assn.,\50\ the Supreme Court noted
that State action decisions involving such private actors are highly
case-specific:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\50\ 531 U.S. 288 (2001).

``What is fairly attributable is a matter of normative judgment, and
the criteria lack rigid simplicity. From the range of circumstances
that could point toward the state behind an individual face, no one
fact can function as a necessary condition across the board for finding
state action; nor is any set of circumstances absolutely sufficient,
for there may be some countervailing reason against attributing
activity to the government . . .
``Our cases have identified a host of facts that can bear on the
fairness of such an attribution. We have, for example, held that a
challenged activity may be state action when it results from the
state's exercise of `coercive power,' . . . when the state provides
`significant encouragement, either overt or covert,' . . . or when a
private actor operates as a `willful participant in joint activity with
the state or its agents,' . . . We have treated a nominally private
entity as a State actor when it is controlled by an `agency of the
state,' . . . when it has been delegated a public function by the
state, . . . when it is `entwined with governmental policies,' or when
government is `entwined in [its] management or control.' ''\51\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Obviously, many of these elements appear present. However, the
Twitter Files also show executives occasionally declining to ban
posters targeted by the Government. It also shows such pressure coming
from the Legislative branch. For example, the Twitter Files reveal that
Twitter refused to carry out censorship requests from at least one
Member targeting a columnist and critic. Twitter declined and one of
its employees simply wrote, ``no, this isn't feasible/we don't do
this.''\52\ There were also requests from Republicans to Twitter for
action against posters, including allegedly one from the Trump White
House to take down content.\53\

down derogatory tweets from the wife of John Legend after the former

We simply do not know the extent of what companies like Twitter
``did do,'' nor for whom. We do not know how demands were declined when
flagged by the CISA, FBI, or other agencies. The report from Twitter
reviewers selected by Elon Musk suggests that most requests coming from
the Executive branch were granted. That is one of the areas that could
be illuminated by this select subcommittee. The investigation may be
able to supply the first comprehensive record of the Government efforts
to use these companies to censor speech. It can pull back the curtain
on America's censorship system so that both Congress and the public can
judge the conduct of our Government.
Whether the surrogate censorship conducted by social media
companies is a form of Government action may be addressed by the courts
in the coming years. However, certain facts are well-established and
warrant Congressional action. First, while these companies and
Government officials prefer to call it ``content moderation,'' these
companies have carried out the largest censorship system in history,
effectively governing the speech of billions of people. The American
Civil Liberties Union, for example, maintains that censorship applies
to both Government and private actions. It is defined as ``the
suppression of words, images, or ideas that are `offensive,' [and]
happens whenever some people succeed in imposing their personal
political or moral values on others.''\54\ Adopting Orwellian
alternative terminology does not alter the fact that these companies
are engaging in the systemic censoring of viewpoints on social media.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\54\ American Civil Liberties Union, What is Censorship?, https://
www.aclu.org/other/what-censorship.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Second, the Government admits that it has supported this massive
censorship system. Even if the censorship is not deemed Government
action for the purposes of the First Amendment, it is now clear that
the Government has actively supported and assisted in the censorship of
citizens. Objecting that the conduct of Government officials may not
qualify under the First Amendment does not answer the question of
whether members believe that the Government should be working for the
censorship of opposing or dissenting viewpoints. During the McCarthy
period, the Government pushed blacklists for suspected communists and
the term ``fellow travelers'' was rightfully denounced regardless of
whether it qualified as a violation of the First Amendment. Even before
Joe McCarthy launched his un-American activities hearings, the Justice
Department created an effective blacklist of organizations called
``Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations'' (AGLOSO) that
was then widely distributed to the media and the public. It became the
foundation for individual blacklists.\55\ The maintenance of the list
fell to the FBI. Ultimately, blacklisting became the norm with both
Legislative and Executive officials tagging artists, writers, and
others. As Professor Geoffrey Stone observed, ``Government at all
levels hunted down `disloyal' individuals and denounced them. Anyone so
stigmatized became a liability to his friends and an outcast to
society.''\56\ At the time, those who raised the same free speech
objections were also attacked as ``fellow travelers'' or ``apologists''
for communists. It was wrong then and it is wrong now. It was an
affront to free speech values that have long been at the core of our
country. It is not enough to say that the Government is merely seeking
the censorship of posters like any other user. There are many things
that are more menacing when done by the Government rather than
individuals. Moreover, the Government is seeking to silence certain
speakers in our collective name and using tax dollars to do so. The FBI
and other agencies have massive powers and resources to amplify
censorship efforts. The question is whether Congress and its individual
members support censorship whether carried out by corporate or
Government officials on social media platforms.\57\

\57\ The distinction between these companies from other corporate
entities like the NFL or Starbucks is important. There is no question
that businesses can limit speech on their premises and by their own
employees. However, these companies constitute the most popular
communication platforms in the country. They are closer to AT&T than
Starbucks in offering a system of communication.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Third, the Government is engaged in targeting users under the
ambiguous mandates of combating disinformation or misinformation. These
are not areas traditionally addressed by public affairs offices to
correct false or misleading statements made about an agency's work. The
courts have repeatedly said that agencies are allowed to speak in their
voices without viewpoint neutrality.\58\ As the Second Circuit stated,
``[w]hen it acts as a speaker, the Government is entitled to favor
certain views over others.''\59\ This was an effort to secretly silence
others. Courts have emphasized that ``[i]t is well-established that
First Amendment rights may be violated by the chilling effect of
governmental action that falls short of a direct prohibition against
speech.''\60\ These public employees were deployed to monitor and
target user spreading ``disinformation'' on a variety of subjects, from
election fraud to Government corruption. The Twitter Files show how
this mandate led to an array of abuses, from targeting jokes to barring
opposing scientific views.

These facts already warrant bipartisan action from Congress. Free
speech advocates have long opposed disinformation mandates as an excuse
or invitation for public or private censorship. I admittedly subscribe
to the view that the solution to bad speech is better speech, not
speech regulation.\61\ Justice Brandeis embraced the view of the
Framers that free speech was its own protection against false
statements: ``If there be time to discover through discussion the
falsehood and the fallacies, to avert the evil by the processes of
education, the remedy to be applied is more speech not enforced
silence.''\62\ We have already seen how disinformation was used to
silence dissenting views of subjects like mask efficacy and COVID
policies like school closures that are now being recognized as
legitimate.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have also seen how claims of Russian trolling operations may
have been overblown in their size or their impact. Indeed, even some
Twitter officials ultimately concluded that the FBI was pushing
exaggerated claims of foreign influence on social media.\63\ The
Twitter Files refer to sharp messages from the FBI when Twitter failed
to find evidence supporting the widely-reported foreign trolling
operations. One Twitter official referred to finding ``no links to
Russia.'' This was not for want of trying. Spurred on by the FBI,
another official promised ``I can brainstorm with [redacted] and see if
we can dig even deeper and try to find a stronger connection.'' The
pressure from the FBI led Roth to tell his colleagues that he was ``not
comfortable'' with the agenda of the FBI and said that it reminded him
of something ``more like something we'd get from a Congressional
committee than the Bureau.''

as part of the investigation into these communications.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The danger of censorship is not solely a concern of one party. To
his great credit, Rep. Ro Khanna (D., Cal.) in October 2020, said that
he was appalled by the censorship and was alarmed by the apparent
``violation of the 1st Amendment principles.''\64\ Congress can bar the
use of Federal funds for such disinformation offices. Such legislation
can require detailed reporting on agency efforts to ban or block public
comments or speech by citizens. Even James Baker told the House
Oversight Committee that there may be a need to pass legislation to
limit the role of Government officials in their dealings with social
media companies.\65\ Legislation can protect the legitimate role of
agencies in responding and disproving statements made out its own
programs or policies. It is censorship, not disinformation, that has
damaged our Nation in recent years. Free speech like sunshine can be
its own disinfectant. In Terminiello v. City of Chicago, the Supreme
Court declared that:

``The right to speak freely and to promote diversity of ideas . . . is

Disinformation does cause divisions, but the solution is not to
embrace Government-corporate censorship. The Government effort to
reduce speech does not solve the problem of disinformation. It does not
change minds but simply silences voices in national debates.
v. conclusion
There is obviously a deep division in Congress over censorship,
with many Members supporting the efforts to blacklist and remove
certain citizens or groups from social media platforms. That is a
debate that many of us in the free speech community welcome. However,
let it be an honest and open debate. The first step in securing such a
debate is to support transparency on the full extent of these efforts
by Federal agencies.
The second step is to allow these questions to be discussed without
attacking journalists and witnesses who come to Congress to share their
own concerns over the threat to both free press and free speech values.
Calling reporters ``so-called journalists'' or others ``Putin lovers''
represent a return to the rhetoric used against free speech advocates
during the Red Scare.\67\ We are better than that as a country and our
Constitution demands more from this body. If Members want to defend
censorship, then do so with the full record before the public on the
scope and standards of this Government effort.

Adlai Stevenson famously warned of this danger: ``Public confidence
in the integrity of the Government is indispensable to faith in
democracy; and when we lose faith in the system, we have lost faith in
everything we fight . . . for.'' Senator Stevenson's words should
resonate on both sides of our political divide and that we might, even
now, find a common ground and common purpose. The loss of faith in our
Government creates political instabilities and vulnerabilities in our
system. Moreover, regardless of party affiliation, we should all want
answers to come of these questions. We can differ on our conclusions,
but the first step for Congress is to force greater transparency on
controversies involving bias to censorship. One of the greatest values
of oversight is to allow greater public understanding of the facts
behind Government actions. Greater transparency is the only course that
can help resolve the doubts that many have over the motivations and
actions of their Government. I remain an optimist that it is still
possible to have a civil and constructive discussion of these issues.
Regardless of our political affiliations and differences, everyone in
this room is here because of a deep love and commitment to this
country. It was what brought us from vastly different backgrounds and
areas in our country. We share a single article of faith in our
Constitution and the values that it represents. We are witnessing a
crisis of faith today that must be healed for the good of our entire
Nation. The first step toward that healing is an open and civil
discussion of the concerns that the public has with our Government. We
can debate what measures are warranted in light of any censorship
conducted with Government assistance. However, we first need to get a
full and complete understanding of the relationship between Federal
agencies and these companies in the removal or suspension of
individuals from social media. At a minimum, that should be a position
that both parties can support in the full disclosure of past Government
conduct and communications with these companies.
Once again, thank you for the honor of appearing before you to
discuss these important issues, and I would be happy to answer any
questions from the committee.

Mr. Bishop. Thank you, Professor Turley.
Members will be recognized by order of seniority for their
5 minutes of questioning. An additional round of questioning
may be called after all Members have been recognized.
I now recognize myself for 5 minutes of questioning.
Mr. Weingarten, you laid out in your testimony, your
written testimony, that CISA--and that's the reason I think
this subcommittee, as the oversight committee, needs to look at
this also, it's an issue of supreme importance--that CISA had a
central role in creating this what I refer to as the censorship
laundering enterprise.
You mentioned that it convened meetings with social media
companies and others and other law enforcement agencies. They
switchboarded, meaning that a request to censor would come in
from other sources. They'd pass them on. They would brief state
officials on sort-of what's acceptable thought and not,
coordinate with public and private-sector partners to, ``build
resilience.'' I'll maybe get a chance to ask Dr. Miller-Idriss
about that topic.
I wonder if you'd elaborate on this one aspect, this
coordination with private-sector partners. Professor Turley
made reference to it. It's an article you made reference to,
the Siegel Tablet mag article. He refers to it as the NGO Borg.
That is to say, all these acronymed entities.
Talk about that, if you would, a little bit.
Mr. Weingarten. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Briefly, switchboarding, that concept of receiving
purported misinformation or disinformation and then passing it
on to a platform and the platform responding and saying
escalated and, yes, under XYZ policy we have actioned, we have
taken action on this tweet.
It seems to me that CISA understood that when it ran up
against domestic speech, even though it appears domestic speech
was captured in its switchboarding efforts, it recognized that
the proper way to do this, in the term that this hearing has
used of laundering it, could be better done through outsourcing
those efforts, but in close coordination with the Government.
So you mentioned before EIP, the Election Integrity
Partnership. This is a consortium of four outside
nongovernmental groups. It includes the Stanford Internet
Observatory, University of Washington's CIP, the Atlantic
Council's DFRLab, as well as a company called Graphika. Many of
these organizations have links and ties to Government
officials.
Essentially what CISA did, in conjunction with EIP and,
according to EIP officials, with some interns who were both
working at CISA while at the same time members of SIO, the
Stanford Internet Observatory, was create a platform to pass
along purported mis-, dis-, and malinformation for this
platform to, as shown in that graphic before, collect and
surveil tweets, to then for this platform to pressure social
media companies to change their terms of service, and then flag
for them specific instances of content they believed ran up
against those flags, and consequently have led to, as shown, 22
million tweets and retweets and such to be labeled
misinformation.
Mr. Bishop. That phenomenon appears to be--it sort-of goes
underground, the Government censoring effort. There are a lot
of other indications that it's kind-of being--the tracks are
being covered. Maybe we'll get a chance to talk about that some
more.
Dr. Kulldorff, you're an epidemiologist of 30 years'
experience, two decades at Harvard. You are, to me, the epitome
of a public health expert. So you made some views, expressed
some views on COVID issues, and then you were censored. CISA
may have played a role in that.
CISA, one of the connections, this Election Integrity
Project or whatever it's called, Partnership, became the
Virality Project, which then censored COVID information. So not
only were you censored by YouTube and Twitter and the like,
there was a Government hand in this kind of censorship.
Thank you for your role in the attorney generals of
Louisiana and Missouri's litigation that is, frankly, to be
thanked for the exposure of a lot of it.
How does that make you feel, that the Government was
responsible for censoring your views?
Mr. Kulldorff. I think it's stunning. If you had mentioned
this 3 years ago, I wouldn't have believed you, that scientists
would be censored in this country.
Mr. Bishop. Dr. Miller-Idriss, you have said--one thing I
appreciated in your testimony, you said that we should protect
people's First Amendment rights as you go about this. How do
you propose to do that?
Ms. Miller-Idriss. Thank you for the question.
I would say by not telling them what to think, by not
censoring them, by not telling people what they should be
thinking, but just helping them make better choices about
recognizing some of the tricky content that, for example, their
kids encounter on-line.
Mr. Bishop. Well, but there's a recognition, the Supreme
Court has recognized that there's a First Amendment right of
access to information as well as the right to speak.
Ms. Miller-Idriss. Yes.
Mr. Bishop. One of your proposals in your policy
recommendation list is that you continue to work with the tech
sector to remove harmful and dangerous content.
If it's content that the First Amendment allows, how could
you possibly justify removing it under the--as a Government
agency?
Ms. Miller-Idriss. Well, I would say, as a Government
employee or agency or anyone would want to remove criminal
content, content that is incitement to violence, criminal
content, something that is inciting someone, that is live-
streaming the murder of people in a Walmart, for example.
That's what I'm talking about when I talk about harmful
content.
Mr. Bishop. OK. My 5 minutes have expired, unfortunately. I
hope we'll be able to have a second round.
I now recognize Ranking Member Ivey for 5 minutes for
questions he may have.
Mr. Ivey. I'm pretty sure we'll have a second round,
whether we like it or not.
Professor Turley, let me come back to you. I thought I
pulled up your testimony here. But it goes to the question I
raised when I was making my opening statement, which was that
you'd raised the issue--I'm sorry. It's page 18 of your
testimony.
``Disinformation does cause divisions, but the solution is
not to embrace Government-corporate censorship.''
So what would be the types of solutions we're looking at?
Just off Dr. Miller-Idriss' statement.
For example, a new phenomenon apparently is people. I guess
when I was a kid they would pull the fire alarm. Now they're
making calls and saying that there's an active shooter at
elementary school X. Because of the networking that everything
has now, that gets picked up by the police and the EMT and
frightened parents, news media, even though it's false.
So one example--I mean, there's multiple others. We could
talk about the recruitment videos and the like. You might have
gradations of those. But, I mean, what would be your take on
how we should be addressing these kinds of issues?
Mr. Turley. Thank you very much for that question.
I actually think there is a lot of common ground there in
terms of what we can do positively to deal with disinformation.
Disinformation is a real thing. It is a thing that people
go on the internet. It seems to be a license for people, and in
an age of rage that license can be truly horrific when you look
at how people transform themselves on the internet.
What I would stress is that the Government should not be in
the business of censorship. That's a bright line that the
Government can live with. Instead, it should focus on producing
better information and to have offices that can counter--
because, remember, the courts have accepted that--the Supreme
Court has said the Government doesn't have to be neutral on
information. When it speaks, it's allowed to take a side. It's
allowed to say what it believes is true.
Mr. Ivey. Well, but let's follow up on that.
So I, as Government official, learn that there's no active
shooter at that elementary school and I call YouTube, Twitter,
whoever, and say, hey, look, that's false information, you're
scaring parents to death, can you take that down?
Mr. Turley. Well, first of all, that example you gave may
indeed be a crime under State law, to make false claims of that
kind with the purpose of triggering panic.
But, more importantly, one of the things that can be done
is that the social media companies and the Government can
immediately flag information they believe is untrue and speak
in their own voice.
What I think we need to develop--and I think there's a lot
of room there to develop it--is to try to create better
guardrails that keep the U.S. Government on this side of
censorship. That includes the use of agencies. The use of
private companies, in my view, do trigger the First Amendment.
I think that the Government has actually violated the First
Amendment.
Mr. Ivey. Since I'm running out of time, there was
something else I wanted to raise. I'll have to come back to you
all in the next round.
You did mention Nina Jankowicz in your statement, who I had
a chance to meet during a deposition in the Judiciary
Committee. I've started following her and what happened with
respect to her. She was the person, as you may recall, who was
appointed to head that board. As it turned out, she was
essentially forced out of the position before it was even
formed.
I'll offer a couple of articles here that can be put into
the record. But there's an individual named Jack Posobiec, I
guess his name is, who put out arguably false information about
her that got picked up by Chairman Jordan and others. Actually,
I think Ms. Taylor Greene had some comments with respect to it.
We can put them in the record. I think Mr. Gaetz did as well.
That sort-of escalated into her getting death threats. She
had to hire a security company. She was 8 months pregnant.
Ms. Greene. Parliamentary question, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Ivey. I didn't say that you----
Mr. Bishop. What is that?
Ms. Greene. He mentioned my name and accused me of saying
false information about Nina Jankowicz.
Mr. Bishop. The committee will be at ease.
Mr. Ivey. Can we pause the clock?
Mr. Bishop. Yes. Please do. In fact, put 20 seconds back on
the clock, please. The committee will suspend.
[Pause.]
Mr. Bishop. Members are reminded not to engage in
personalities.
The gentleman is recognized.
Mr. Ivey. Thank you.
But Members of Congress made comments about her that took
on a life of their own, that became viral on the internet, led
to the death threats that she got--and still gets, actually,
even though she's been out of the position for about a year, at
least. I think she's filing a lawsuit against FOX for
propagating these stories as well.
But she was clearly a victim of, in my view,
misinformation, disinformation. From her perspective, it was
very ironic, because that's what she was actually brought into
the Government to try and address.
So I'll come back to it later. But thank you, Professor
Turley, for your comments.
Mr. Bishop. The gentleman yields back.
I now recognize the gentlelady, Ms. Greene of Georgia, for
her 5 minutes.
Ms. Greene. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, witnesses, for coming before our committee
today.
I am one of those that believe our First Amendment is one
of the greatest rights that we have. I also am so grateful to
be an American, always believing that freedom of speech was
something that we possessed until the past few years, where
myself and many other Americans--Dr. Kulldorff--we found
ourselves--I, like you, had my Twitter account permanently
banned for posting my speech, opinions, and thoughts on Twitter
about COVID-19.
I'm not a doctor or an expert like you are. You certainly
are an expert in the field on it. It's a shame that you had
your speech censored.
But it's appalling to me that CISA, which is taxpayer-
funded by the American people, the same American people that
are given the right to the freedom of speech, that are given
this great freedom by our Founders, had their speech censored.
That combination between the Homeland Security and CISA,
working with private companies, big tech companies and others,
to silence Americans is a grave assault on all of these
Americans' First Amendment rights.
So I'd like to ask each of you, Mr. Weingarten, do you
believe in the First Amendment?
Mr. Weingarten. Wholeheartedly.
Ms. Greene. Dr. Kulldorff.
Mr. Kulldorff. I do.
Ms. Greene. Dr. Miller-Idriss.
Ms. Miller-Idriss. Absolutely.
Ms. Greene. Mr. Turley.
Mr. Turley. I do.
Ms. Greene. Great. Well, it seems that we all share the
same belief.
I would like to ask, since we're talking about truth and
information, given that CISA engaged in this with the
Department of Homeland, who is the author of truth? I'll ask
each of you again. Who's in charge of truth?
Mr. Weingarten.
Mr. Weingarten. Well, I believe, as citizens, we're all
entitled to evaluate facts and opinions and decide for
ourselves.
Ms. Greene. Dr. Kulldorff.
Mr. Kulldorff. Nobody is in charge. It's a collective
responsibility.
Ms. Greene. Dr. Miller-Idriss.
Ms. Miller-Idriss. I agree. There's no truth with a capital
``T''. I think we all need to be equipped with the tools to
evaluate evidence and make decisions.
Ms. Greene. Mr. Turley.
Mr. Turley. I agree with all those comments.
Ms. Greene. Great. This is very overwhelmingly fantastic.
But I'd like to ask a question, Dr. Miller-Idriss, if I
may.
You're an expert on so-called right-wing extremism,
including on-line radicalization by right-wing extremist
groups. You've written several books on right-wing extremism,
including ``Hate in the Homeland: The New Global Far Right.''
You're a member of the Southern Poverty Law Center, the SPLC
Tracking Hate and Extremism Advisory Committee.
I couldn't find any of your work studying left extremism or
antifa or BLM. I mean, we all know antifa and BLM riots are
responsible for $2 billion of damage across American cities in
2020, and antifa literally took over Portland and declared
their own autonomous zone.
So I'm just wondering, how do you consider your
organization, PERIL, a good source of informing people on what
they should believe and not believe when you do no study
whatsoever into left extremism?
Ms. Miller-Idriss. Thank you for the question.
I'm an expert on the far right because I spent the first 20
years of my career working in Germany in the post-Holocaust,
post-unification surge of far-right extremism. I know you have
a hearing on Tuesday on far-left extremism.
Ms. Greene. Yes. But, Dr. Miller-Idriss, just to let you
know, this is America. We're not Nazi Germany.
Ms. Miller-Idriss. Yes, absolutely right. But that's how
when I pivoted here, the first time I was asked to testify was
about that evidence that I had learned from what Germany had
been doing, and then that became relevant here for policy
makers.
But we don't--first of all, just to respond to your query
about what we teach people, we don't teach people anything. We
are just looking at helping them understand what the tactics of
manipulation are on-line so they can make better decisions.
We have experts who do work on environmental extremism. We
have experts who work on Islamist forms of extremism. But
because, both under the Trump administration and the Biden
administration, the emphasis has been right now on the
greatest, most lethal threat, which has been determined to be
far right, meaning white supremacist extremism and unlawful
militias----
Ms. Greene. Well, Dr. Miller-Idriss, just real quick, I'm
out of time. But would you consider Trump supporters
extremists?
Ms. Miller-Idriss. We are worried about violent extremism.
So that to the extent--not about what people believe, but to
the extent that they are moving toward violence.
Ms. Greene. Trump supporters specifically?
Ms. Miller-Idriss. If they're calling for violence. It
doesn't matter to me who they support.
Ms. Greene. I haven't seen any--by the way, there's a great
rally in Iowa this weekend if you want to study people on the
right and what they believe. You'll find secure borders,
freedom of speech.
Mr. Bishop. The gentlewoman's time----
Ms. Greene. No crime.
Thank you. I yield back.
Mr. Bishop. The gentlewoman's time has expired.
I recognize Mrs. Ramirez for her 5 minutes of questioning.
Mrs. Ramirez. Thank you, Chairman and Ranking Member Ivey.
I have a couple of comments for Dr. Miller-Idriss. But I
want to come back real quick before that to something I heard a
couple of my colleagues mention. This question is for Dr.
Kulldorff.
I heard that it was referred that you too have been
censored by CISA and sharing that concern that both of you are
censored. Could you give me examples of how CISA has censored
you?
Mr. Kulldorff. I was censored by Twitter, by YouTube, by
LinkedIn, Facebook, and Reddit. They don't tell who is behind
it. So sometimes they don't say anything. Whatever I said just
disappears. Sometimes one gets a note saying something of the
style of, ``It goes against our standards.'' But they never
tell--they never told me, the person being censored, who was
behind it.
Mrs. Ramirez. So, Doctor, just for the record here, just I
think on the record here, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency, you have no evidence that they censored you.
You were told by Twitter and other social media outlets that
you were not allowed to continue posting these things, but CISA
itself there's no evidence was censoring you, correct? Yes or
no?
Mr. Kulldorff. They never disclosed who sort-of was behind
it or what was behind it.
Mrs. Ramirez. OK. Well, thank you. I just wanted to make
sure that that was on the record, that CISA itself had not
censored you. There's no evidence of that.
So I want to come back, Dr. Miller-Idriss, to the work that
you've been doing, your work on disinformation and the role of
hate in community violence.
Look, it could not be happening at a more urgent time. We
talk about the border here. We talk about children, families,
people seeking asylum. There's all sorts of things that are
said about them.
Just a few days since--just a few days ago someone
senselessly drove their car into a group of migrants outside of
a shelter in Brownsville, the same border that my mother
crossed pregnant with me. A witness of the horrible scene heard
the attacker make anti-immigrant remarks after he initially
tried to run away after plowing his car into people, killing
several and injuring more.
There isn't always a written manifesto to directly point to
when it comes to extreme hate, but we know there's a troubling
connection between spreading hateful ideas and extreme violence
that destabilizes entire communities, and the cost for this
could be human lives.
In your testimony you shared that pace, scope, and scale of
violent extremism have probably increased and are escalating
rapidly due to propaganda, conspiracy theories, and
disinformation. Is that correct?
Ms. Miller-Idriss. Yes.
Mrs. Ramirez. What kind of impact does spreading propaganda
and disinformation have on vulnerable communities, such as
immigrants and asylum seekers?
Ms. Miller-Idriss. The impact on vulnerable communities, of
course, is to terrorize them. So we saw that in Buffalo. We've
seen that in Pittsburgh. We've seen that in record-breaking
anti-Semitism and attacks on the LGBTQ community. With every
vulnerable community, essentially, we're seeing spikes, surges,
or record-breaking hate. Hate crimes are higher than they've
been in well over a decade.
So the impact is on families that are torn apart,
communities that are torn apart, but also people who are afraid
to go to synagogue, to go to church, to go to their school
board meetings in some cases, that they're going to be met with
violent protesters.
Mrs. Ramirez. Thank you.
There's an extremely disturbing rise in people who commit
extreme violence that cite the great replacement theory, which,
to be absolutely clear, is a white supremacist conspiracy
theory that alleges that white people are being replaced by
Black and Brown people, including immigrants.
In your opinion, what are the most effective strategies for
countering conspiracy theories like the great replacement
theory that promote deadly violence and are frequently a source
of inspiration for people who commit horrific violence in our
communities?
Ms. Miller-Idriss. Well, what we have found is that
people--nobody likes to find out that they're being
manipulated. People do not like to find out that they're being
manipulated or that they're at risk of manipulation.
I think it is extremely difficult to counter propaganda and
conspiracy theories once they circulate. You get into
challenges to freedom of speech. You get into censorship
issues. You also get into ineffective strategies, as we've
seen.
But what does work is to prevent people from believing it
in the first place. We have excellent evidence that that can be
done by teaching them how manipulative tactics work and letting
them make up their own minds.
Mrs. Ramirez. Dr. Miller-Idriss, I really appreciate all of
your work.
Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Bishop. The gentlelady yields back.
I now recognize Mr. Ezell for his 5 minutes of questioning.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
CISA has an important mission in safeguarding cyber
networks and protecting the physical infrastructure that our
society depends on. The agency has enjoyed broad bipartisan
support since Congress established CISA in 2018 because it
plays a key role in protecting the homeland. It is my goal that
this continues with its original intent.
Mr. Weingarten, what concerns do you have about CISA's
ability to fulfill its core responsibilities?
Mr. Weingarten. Well, I would say there's a huge
opportunity cost to devoting resources supposed to be intended
toward foreign threat actors toward domestic ones, and on the
basis of interpreting speech to be a threat to a virtually
limitlessly-defined critical infrastructure, up to and
including our brands.
So the first thing would be it's a huge shift in resources.
To the extent it's trampling on our rights directly or by
proxy, that directly undermines its mission.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you.
Documents obtained in a lawsuit show Brian Scully, a deputy
of CISA's Countering Foreign Influence Task Force,
communicating regularly with external organizations. At one
point Mr. Scully even offers up a CISA-run web page as a
resource to help with one partner's ``pre-bunking'' efforts.
In other words, CISA was generating content and then
pushing it through external parties to shape their censorship
efforts.
Can you walk us through some of the key players involved in
discussions like these and how they work together to create a
censorship operation, Mr. Weingarten?
Mr. Weingarten. So, as you noted, Mr. Scully is one senior
official who I believe is the chief of the MDM team now. It is
worth noting that that foreign task force became the MDM team,
going from foreign to domestic and foreign actors under its
purview.
Beyond that, Matt Masterson, I believe, was a top election
official within CISA. He ultimately would end up, I believe,
becoming a--it may be a nonresident fellow at the Stanford
Internet Observatory. There's sort-of a revolving door here.
Worth noting, Christopher Krebs, as well, former director
of CISA, he ended up starting a consultancy with the head of
SIO, Alex Stamos.
We can go through several other individuals on the outside,
as well. So non-CISA officials but officials--or, rather,
principals who were coordinated by CISA, worked with CISA,
ended up on CISA's advisory committees and such. Those would
include Kate Starbird at the University of Washington's CIP, as
well. Renee DiResta within SIO, I believe, was a research
director there. She has direct ties to CISA advisory
committees, as well.
So there's a slew of people, and it's sort-of a revolving
door, and it starts to blur the line between public and
private.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you.
Professor Turley, this censorship laundering enterprise
basically gives Government officials and their private-sector
partners the power to control public discourse.
What is the danger of the Government focusing on some of
these subjective terms like misinformation and malinformation?
Mr. Turley. Well, the danger is significant. You have terms
like malinformation that starts out by saying the information
may be true, but we're going to target that information because
it's being used to manipulate others.
Statements like that are really quite chilling for all of
us that value free speech. The question is, should the
Government be in that business?
But it is in that business. I mean, in terms of the two
legal issues that we look at, these are Government agents who
are acting.
So we don't even have to get into the question of whether
there's an agency relationship with private companies. There
are Government officials who are taking these acts and actively
participating in what is the largest censorship system in the
history of this country.
Then, second, you have private actors who are being used by
what I call censorship by surrogate. Both of those raise
Constitutional questions.
But putting all that aside, one of the things I emphasize
in my testimony is people constantly have this mantra: It's not
a First Amendment problem, so it's not a free speech problem.
That's not true. The First Amendment is designed to deal
with one problem of free speech. It was the traditional, the
most looming problem at the time. It is not synonymous or
exclusive with the term free speech.
What the U.S. Government is doing now is a serious threat
to free speech.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Mr. Turley.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Bishop. The gentleman yields back.
The Chair now recognizes Ms. Clarke for her 5 minutes of
questioning.
Ms. Clarke. Good afternoon.
First, let me thank our panel of witnesses for joining us
today and thank Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Ivey for
calling this hearing.
The Department's role in addressing mis-, dis-, and
malinformation is certainly a worthy topic of discussion for
this subcommittee.
Unfortunately, many of my colleagues are politicizing a
serious issue today, and I'd like to set the record straight.
The rapid spread of mis-, dis-, and malinformation is a
threat to our security and to the institutions at the
foundation of our democracy.
Both the Department of Homeland Security's Office of
Inspector General and the Homeland Security Advisory Council
have determined disinformation to be a threat to national
security and to the successful execution of DHS's mission, from
disaster response, to border security, to election security.
Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to insert into the
record reports on disinformation from the DHS Office of the
Inspector General* and the Homeland Security Advisory
Council**.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr. Bishop. Without objection, so ordered.
Ms. Clarke. Thank you.
As the former Chair of the Subcommittee on Cybersecurity
and Infrastructure Protection, I'm acutely aware of the threat
mis-,
dis-, and malinformation poses to the election security and
other critical infrastructure.
In 2020, DHS had to provide guidance to telecommunications
firms to prevent attacks on 5G cell towers linked to a COVID
conspiracy theory.
In the wake of the election-related disinformation
campaigns aimed to undermine public confidence in election
outcomes, CISA established Rumor Control to serve as a trusted
source of election information.
Suffice it to say, the threat posed by disinformation is
real and we have to take it seriously.
Dr. Miller-Idriss, I thank you for your testimony today and
for your leadership in developing mechanisms to combat
disinformation.
Would it surprise you to learn that the intelligence
community has referenced misinformation or disinformation as a
threat to national security in every Worldwide Threat
Assessment except one since 2016?
Ms. Miller-Idriss. No, that does not surprise me.
Ms. Clarke. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to insert
into the record the Worldwide Threat Assessments from 2016,
2018, and 2023.***

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr. Bishop. Without objection, so ordered.
Ms. Clarke. Thank you, sir.
I am concerned that my colleagues are attempting to make a
real discussion about combating disinformation so politically
toxic that no one will touch it. What kind of threat does that
pose to our national security?
Well, I yield back.
Mr. Bishop. The gentlelady yields back.
I now recognize Mr. Strong for his 5 minutes of
questioning.
Mr. Strong. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I'd like to remember those that are defending America's
Southern Border, as we're a matter of hours from not an
insurgent, but an all-out invasion of tens of thousands of
illegal migrants, to name a few, from Mexico, Guatemala,
Honduras, El Salvador, Cuba, Haiti, Iran, Russia, and China
too.
While fentanyl, heroin, cocaine, marijuana continue to pour
into America, the Secretary of Homeland Security continues to
testify and spew on every network that he has operational
control of the Southern Border.
As this administration struggles to admit that their
policies created the Southern Border debacle that will soon
unfold before the world's eyes, the fact is President Donald
Trump's policies worked and America was protected.
Thank you again for being here with us today.
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or
CISA, was originally formed under the Trump administration to
reduce and eliminate threats to U.S. critical physical and
cyber infrastructure. It's hard to believe the agency has
gotten so far away from its original mission.
This shouldn't come as a surprise if you recall CISA
director Jen Easterly's view on CISA's mission, which Chairman
Bishop just reminded us of.
In August 2021, she said, ``One could argue we are in the
business of critical infrastructure, and the most critical
infrastructure is our cognitive infrastructure.''
The director of CISA, whose mission is to protect and
secure our country's sensitive infrastructure, is more worried
about policing America's thoughts than cyber attacks coming
from China and Russia.
Much of the public information regarding CISA's censorship
activities is only known because of the Missouri v. Biden
lawsuit and the release of internal communications from Twitter
after it came under new ownership.
One such revelation includes that there is a formalized
process--a formalized process--for Government officials to
directly flag content on Facebook and Instagram and request its
removal or suppression.
I have an image that I would like to put on the screen.
[Slide.]
Mr. Bishop. So ordered.
[The information follows:]

Mr. Strong. This is the landing page for Meta's content
request system, which is still active as of this morning, you
must have a Government or law enforcement email to use. Yet
CISA officials maintain that they, ``don't flag anything to
social media organizations at all. We don't do any
censorship.''
Mr. Weingarten, can you share some additional examples of
actions that DHS and CISA specifically have taken to keep their
actions hidden from America's people?
Mr. Weingarten. Thank you, Congressman.
Mr. Strong. Yes, sir.
Mr. Weingarten. Several instances of this.
First, there's been stonewalling of Congressional inquiries
into CISA's efforts, and subsequently the House Judiciary
Weaponization Subcommittee has subpoenaed Director Easterly in
connection with the subject that we're talking about today.
Beyond that, there's been scrubbing of not only documents
but also websites, which illustrates the fact that CISA was
intently focused and may well still be intently focused and
certainly its partners are intently focused on domestic speech.
In fact, it's almost comical. If you go to a site, I
believe the URL was cisa.gov/mdm, it now takes you to a foreign
mis-, dis-, and malinformation site. There's no sign of
domestic activity that it's pursuing related to it.
So I'd say scrubbing, stonewalling are the two biggest
instances that we've seen thus far.
Mr. Strong. Thank you.
There have been several examples of DHS trying to expand
its censorship activities, only to back down when the public
found out, such as last year's effort to create a
Disinformation Governance Board.
Mr. Weingarten, do these actions suggest about where DHS
would like to go in the disinformation space in the future?
Mr. Weingarten. I think by the words of the DHS Secretary,
absolutely. But if they are not able to carry it on, their
partners actually in the private-sector side were encouraging
the creation, I believe, of something like a Center for Mis-
and Disinformation Excellence within the Government, and that
seems to be what the DGB was intended to be.
But we have other ministries of countering mis-, dis-, and
malinformation, even if there isn't some oversight body layered
onto it.
Mr. Strong. Thank you.
I thank each of you for being here today.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Bishop. Thank you. The gentleman yields back.
I now recognize the gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Crane, for
his 5 minutes.
Mr. Crane. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you guys for being here.
I'd like to take a second to push back on one of my
colleague's comments that he made a second ago to a friend of
mine who's not in the room to defend herself.
Mr. Ivey actually said, ``I guess Ms. Lake is still saying
that the election was stolen from her even though it's clear,
according to the officials in the State, that this was not the
case.''
Now, I find it funny when people in this town use that
defense ``according to the officials.'' Right. Like the
American people believe the officials. They don't. A recent Pew
study showed that only 20 percent of the American people
believe the elected officials.
It's also funny, too, because we all know that election
fraud couldn't take place in this country, could it? Right?
This is America. That couldn't take place here.
Mr. Ivey. Will the gentleman yield for a request?
Mr. Crane. Just recently we're finding out that this
President, this Commander-in-Chief, has used his position and
influence for years to funnel millions of dollars to his
family. That's something I also thought I'd never see in this
town.
Mr. Ivey. Will the gentleman yield?
Mr. Crane. No, I will not. No, I will not.
Mr. Ivey. I mean, you did invoke my name.
Mr. Crane. Well, I actually quoted you. So I will not.
All right. Though I don't agree with Mr. Ivey's comments,
I'm glad that he's allowed to say them, because I do support
the First Amendment. I support his First Amendment. I support
everybody in this room's First Amendment.
You know what? You know what's important about supporting
the First Amendment? It's most important when you disagree with
people. That's really the only time it's important, because
when we don't agree--everybody supports the First Amendment
when you agree with somebody.
It's interesting, because I was listening to the panel up
here and we went down the line and everybody here said that
they support the First Amendment.
Yet, when we were going back and researching some of Dr.
Miller-Idriss' comments, MSNBC, 7/17 of 2022, on the January 6
hearings, she says this: ``What we need right now is a massive
investment in and commitment to countering disinformation at
all levels. This includes holding tech companies accountable
for dangerous and harmful information shared on their
platforms.''
She goes on to say, ``It requires strategies to prevent
public and elected officials from sharing disinformation or
trying to undermine our elections and the peaceful transfer of
power.
``But above all, we need serious and sustained public
education and campaigns to build population-wide resilience to
disinformation, understanding of source integrity, and ways to
distill false claims from true facts.''
It's interesting, ma'am, because it seems like you only
support free speech when you agree with it or you wouldn't make
the statement, ``It requires strategies''--I'm going to zone in
here on this--``strategies to prevent public and elected
officials from sharing disinformation.''
I've gone through some of your tweets, ma'am. Whether we're
talking about COVID vaccines or far-right extreme groups,
there's a lot of things that you and I would disagree on. As a
matter of fact, there's a lot of things that people sitting on
your left and right would disagree on.
But you think that we should stop them from being able,
according to your own quote, according to your own words, that
we should stop them from being able to say that.
That's a problem, ma'am, because, I'll tell you again, the
most important time to support somebody's free speech isn't
when you agree with them. It's when you disagree with them.
Ma'am, I hope that you and others that think like you are
not successful, because I fought really hard to make sure that
my kids, and hopefully some day my grandkids, don't live under
communism or socialism or some other tyrannical dictatorship.
Thank you. I yield back.
Mr. Bishop. The gentleman yields back.
Mr. Thanedar is recognized for his 5 minutes of
questioning.
Mr. Thanedar. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
I want to thank all the witnesses to be here and for your
testimony.
I have a question for Dr. Miller-Idriss, if I may.
As we have heard here today, the disinformation that
spreads on-line can have dangerous real-world consequences.
Disinformation has been used to incite violence, including the
January 6 insurrection and crime targeted at ethnic minorities.
This disinformation undermines trust in journalism and science
and drowns out marginalized voices.
Dr. Miller-Idriss, based on your research and expertise,
what have you found are the best strategies for combating
pervasive disinformation campaigns?
Ms. Miller-Idriss. Thank you for the question.
What we find in the evidence is that the best way to work
to combat disinformation, if you will, is to prevent people
from making the choices that would lead to the spread of that
to begin with.
So we focus on teaching people about manipulative tactics,
regardless of the content, and also about recognizing sort-of
warning signs in their loved ones, regardless of the ideology.
So, for example, one of the things we hear from our focus
groups is that young people have been saying in classrooms
things like there is no political solution. That comes from the
left. That comes from the right. It is a call to violence to
say there's no more political solution, we have to move to
violence.
So if an adult hears that, they know that a child is
exposed to something on-line that is potentially opening up
rabbit holes of further harm and disinformation. So that's what
we work on.
Mr. Thanedar. Thank you.
Now, despite my Republican colleagues' misplaced fixation
on the defunct Disinformation Governance Board and their own
disinformation on the board's intended role, the Department of
Homeland Security has a significant and valid role to play in
combating the dangerous disinformation that compromises our
security.
There are plenty of examples of disinformation occurring
that has a homeland security nexus, including that tied to
domestic terrorism, election security, migration, and disaster
responses.
Now, to what extent should DHS and other Governmental
agencies be identifying and addressing harmful content that may
threaten homeland security?
Ms. Miller-Idriss. Thank you for the question.
I think that what we hear anyway in our lab is that
American communities are desperate. They are worried. They're
worried about what they're seeing, what their loved ones are
seeing, and they're afraid.
So I think that the Government has an obligation to help
local communities with better ways to recognize and reject
harmful content.
I think that that includes a national security frame, but
not exclusively a national security frame. That has to also be
something that is education, that is health and human services,
that is about what local communities need.
That needs to include some expertise in where to draw the
line. I would welcome the opportunity to have longer
conversations about where that line falls, because I think
that's one of the biggest issues we face.
Mr. Thanedar. Well, I thank you.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Bishop. The gentleman yields back.
We'll proceed to a second round of questioning. We are up
against votes, so we'll try to proceed as quickly as we can.
We'll see if the witnesses are available to remain if we have
to have a break for votes. We'll see if you can do that.
So I at this time recognize--well, let me do this first.
Without objection, I want to submit for the record the
graphic shown by Mr. Strong during his 5 minutes, the Facebook
Content Request screen.
[The information follows:]

Mr. Bishop. Now I recognize myself for 5 minutes of
questioning.
So, Dr. Miller-Idriss, I want to sort-of pursue where I
left off and others have illustrated.
I think you said, notwithstanding what you wrote, that we
should continue to work with social media platforms to remove
harmful and dangerous, I think was your terminology. Then you
gave some examples, an example of a bomb threat or something
like that. That's illegal speech, not protected by the First
Amendment.
But let me just clarify, because I think the concern is,
whether or not you're concerned about manipulation and
propaganda and these sort of things, there may be a subterfuge
for subtle censorship.
So let me get at it in this way. Do you believe that
propaganda from foreign governments should be allowed on social
media and the Federal Government should--and the Government
should take no effort to interfere with or facilitate its
removal?
Ms. Miller-Idriss. I believe that if there is
disinformation circulating from foreign governments that is
intended to harm our democracy, that that should be removed,
that that should be removed.
Mr. Bishop. Are you a lawyer?
Ms. Miller-Idriss. No.
Mr. Bishop. OK. So there's a case called Lamont v.
Postmaster General from 1965, it's old law, in which the U.S.
Supreme Court held that a United States citizen has a First
Amendment right to foreign communist propaganda that comes
through the mails to us.
Do you think communist propaganda might be harmful?
Ms. Miller-Idriss. I think that--I think I'm flattered that
you think that my expertise extends that broadly to
disinformation and propaganda across the spectrum. My expertise
as a professor of education is about equipping communities with
tools to reject harmful content.
Mr. Bishop. Well, and I'm not trying to be unfair. What I'm
trying to do--I am trying to pin you down a little bit. Because
there's this notion--and I think Professor Turley's gotten to
it some--but there's this notion out there that, well, we're
not against--we want to preserve--I get this all the time--
we're going protect the First Amendment, protect everybody's
First Amendment rights.
But what I was just sharing with you is that there's a
First Amendment right to propaganda, communist propaganda from
abroad, that's been established as long as I've been alive.
Ms. Miller-Idriss. Yes.
Mr. Bishop. So is that harmful? Do you include that? I'm
not trying to repeat the question.
I am trying to say this. If you're trying to--you say you
want to teach people what is manipulative and not to be
manipulated. I have no problem about that. But you also are
proposing to this committee that there's a massive Government
investment, Government should invest in you, frankly.
Well, let me ask you this: You are funded by the Department
of Homeland Security, right?
Ms. Miller-Idriss. Uh-huh.
Mr. Bishop. Is anybody else here, by the way, funded by the
Department of Homeland Security?
[Nonverbal response.]
Mr. Bishop. You have funding from the National Science
Foundation? Is that correct?
Ms. Miller-Idriss. I did.
Mr. Bishop. You did. OK.
Anybody else?
[Nonverbal response.]
Mr. Bishop. The Government--I think what concerns me is you
seem to think that you are the right arbiter to decide what is
misinformation, malinformation, which is actually true but
somehow being misused for harm.
How do you arrogate that? I mean, that's the wrong term.
How do you assume that you should be the arbiter?
With respect, you are on the left. There's a tweet from a
couple of days ago where you're talking about whiteness and how
the Irish were not white and then became white. I mean, it
seems to me to be fairly extreme even by the standards I hear
from my colleagues on the Democrat.
Why should you be the arbiter to decide who needs to be
protected from manipulation or propaganda?
Ms. Miller-Idriss. I understand the question and your
concern, and I should not be the arbiter as an individual.
I run a research lab. When we get asked to equip local
communities with tools, we do a comprehensive mapping of all
propaganda. We do interviews, focus groups with people. We
figure out what that content is. Then we equip, then we create
the tools, and then we test it, like we did, like I reported on
here today.
So I'm never putting my opinion into--I'm a columnist
separately with an opinion. But I never put my opinion into the
classroom or into the research tools. That comes from a group
of people who are hired to work on it with their methodological
expertise.
Mr. Bishop. Let me see if I can get the professor in,
Professor Turley, to deal with this. Because it seems to me
that the notion that the Government should take, with all
respect, Dr. Miller-Idriss' view of what is manipulative or
what is misinformation and then have that sort-of spread out to
the public to teach them to be prepared is a recipe for
disaster.
Can you speak to that, Professor Turley?
Mr. Turley. Well, it's also tragically familiar. I'm just
finishing a book on free speech now, and it goes back to
England before the Revolution. Many of the rationales we use
today actually came from not only England, but came from the
Star Chamber. The Star Chamber was used to prosecute sedition.
They came up with this idea that there's, ``bad tendency
speech,'' that there's some speech that has a bad tendency.
That took hold in the United States. Even though many of
the Framers rejected it, it took hold with some early
decisions. Holmes is a good example of losing his mind by
saying, talking about crying fire in a crowd theater, which he
regretted, and that decision was later rejected by the Supreme
Court.
The Government should not be in the disinformation
business. It should not be trying to shape speech. It's a very
clear line and one that we have lost.
Mr. Bishop. One of the problems--and I'll turn it over in
just a second--but one of the problems seems to me that people
think--it's a vague concept--they want to preserve the full
right to speak that the First Amendment or the right to have
access to information, and yet I'm not sure we know what that
is. You've got to know what the law is before you know whether
you're agreeing with it or you're doing something in violation
of it, with all respect.
My time has more than expired. I yield to Mr. Ivey for his
5 minutes of questions.
You're recognized.
Mr. Ivey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I think it's a complicated area, I mean, just sort-of what
we're going through, for example, the statement that there's no
specific truth, which I think sounds fine in the abstract.
But if you say something like, ``Sir, if someone accused
you of being a sexual pedophile, how would you respond?''
that's a false statement. That's definitely not true. So when
we say there's no such thing as truth, I do kind of struggle
with those.
With the issue with respect to elections, Mr. Crane's gone,
we had a chance to chat a little bit outside, but just briefly,
and I'll come back to this point.
I did want to note that he mentioned public officials
aren't trusted. But only a public official can certify
elections. So if there's no public official in Arizona that's
going to say the election is accepted--usually it's the
secretary of state--I don't know what they do out there with
that. But I'm pretty sure they do it just like all the other 50
States do.
But, anyway, back to this point. I think really quick on
that point, a couple public--we talked about Government speech
and what they do.
Wear your seat belts. I'm old enough to remember a time
before we had seat belts, and then there was a pushback about
putting them in the cars. Then there was pushback, free speech
pushback, but statements I think were clearly false, that they
weren't necessary, they didn't save lives. I'm OK with the
Government doing that.
Tobacco's another one. I grew up in North Carolina and
Virginia. Everything--they almost had tobacco-flavored
pacifiers in North Carolina back in those days because it was
the way to go. But clearly it was dangerous to our health. I
don't even know if the tobacco industry's come around to
acknowledging that. But clearly it's true, it hurts your
health, and clearly their denials were false.
Another one's drunk driving. I remember when people have a
steering wheel in one hand and a beer in the other one and it
was OK. That had to change over time because it was true that
driving and drinking were a bad combination.
So I think it can be tricky if we get too absolute in the
statements that we're making along these lines.
I do take Professor Turley's point, although even in those
circumstances I think there are scenarios where it makes sense
for the Government to at least be involved.
Now, we might not say they should be able to take down
information. But in the damaging scenarios that we talked
about, for example, or people giving false weather information,
just things that can really cause dislocations in people's
lives, I think it should be an option for the Government to
say, ``No, that's incorrect.''
We run into scenarios with respect to COVID and others. I
take that point. I'm not an epidemiologist. But I think we have
to be careful about sort-of pushing and saying none of them can
get involved.
I apologize. We were just talking about we wish we had more
than 5 minutes. I mean, sort-of the question I had, Mr.
Weingarten, you raised--well, and Mr. Turley, too, I guess--
sort-of the private entities coming together to have
communications about what to take down or whatever. I take it
you view that as you see negative connotations around that.
I do kind-of wonder if there are some good reasons for them
to do that. For example, lawsuits in the Government are now
pushing them in the direction of they are being pushed toward
managing content. If they don't, they get in trouble for it.
Matter of fact, they get dragged up here by Congress who beats
them up about not taking it down.
We could go back to the TikTok hearing. What was that, last
month? I don't agree with everything TikTok's doing, but we are
putting a lot on them and expecting them to manage content and
essentially publicly punishing them when they don't.
So there may be a reason to have those conversations. Maybe
we'll have another hearing where people can come up from DHS
and from some of these entities. I'm open to that. We could
talk about it then.
I did want to finish with this. Nina Jankowicz, I did want
to not leave that unfinished. There's a couple articles I'd
like to offer for the record. One is ``'A surreal experience':
Former Biden `disinfo' chief details harassment.'' That's out
of Politico. Then the other one is ``Old comments by
disinformation board director misrepresented on-line.'' That's
an AP story.
I'd like to offer those for the record, as well.
Mr. Bishop. Without objection, so ordered.

`a surreal experience': former biden `disinfo' chief details harassment
By Heidi Przybyla
03/08/2023 04:30 AM EST
In a Valentine's Day court hearing in Arlington, Virginia, Nina
Jankowicz finally got to face a man who'd been stalking her for nearly
a year and secured a restraining order against him.
Jankowicz, 33, is a researcher and author of two books whose stint
heading the Biden administration's Disinformation Governance Board
lasted a few weeks last spring before the board itself was dissolved by
the administration following an outcry by GOP lawmakers that it was
going to censor the free speech of conservatives.
But that was just the beginning, she said, detailing for the first
time a year of intense public and online harassment spurred, she said,
by conservative media attacks and emblemized by the self-styled
citizen-journalist who repeatedly stalked her, doxxing and recording
her without her consent.
``It was a surreal experience to be forced to confront this guy,''
Jankowicz told POLITICO in an interview. In one video, she says, the
man said her newborn should be put in ``baby jail.''
Now, it looks like Jankowicz will be back in the spotlight. Rep.
Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) plans to make Jankowicz a star witness before his
new Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of Government, which
Republicans say will investigate alleged abuses of Federal authority.
On Monday, Jordan issued a subpoena compelling Jankowicz to sit for a
deposition and Jankowicz says she will abide by it.
Jankowicz says her story shows what can happen to any private
citizen or government official who gets cast as a villain in a far-
right conspiracy plot. ``I didn't intend for my entire career to be lit
on fire before my eyes by taking this job,'' she said.
The now-defunct initiative that Jankowicz briefly headed was aimed
at developing government-wide recommendations to stop the flow of
disinformation sponsored by China, Russia and violent domestic
extremists.
Jankowicz, who managed programs on Russia and Belarus for the
National Democratic Institute and has advised the Ukrainian government,
was chosen for her expertise in online disinformation, according to the
Department of Homeland Security, under which she served.
Jordan says she has refused several requests to testify
voluntarily. Jankowicz and her attorney say that's because the
assumption behind his demand--that she was tasked to police speech--is
false. In his subpoena letter, Jordan said she is ``uniquely situated''
to provide relevant information about the board.
Jankowicz, who is a new mother, says she plans to file a lawsuit
against Fox News and launched a crowdsourcing campaign to support her
legal fees.
``Fox News irrevocably changed my life when they force fed lies
about me to tens of millions of their viewers,'' she says in a video
accompanying her GoFundMe. ``In addition to the deferral of my dream of
serving my country, I've lost something irreplaceable: peace with my
son during his first year in the world,'' she says in the video.
Fox News did not respond to multiple emails to company
spokespersons seeking comment.
On Fox shows including those hosted by Laura Ingraham, Tucker
Carlson and Sean Hannity, she's been called a ``conspiracy theorist,''
a ``useful idiot,'' and ``insane.''
When she was 8 months pregnant, said Jankowicz, strangers online
were calling her a Nazi and ugly and said she should die.
Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) decried her ``history of spreading
disinformation.''
Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) repeatedly said the board was akin to
the ``Communist `Ministry of Truth.' '' Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) even
said she ``appears to be mentally unstable.'' Rep. Marjorie Taylor
Greene (R-Ga.) said she felt sorry her child has to ``have that kind of
mother.''
For a time, she says, her blood pressure spiked. She wore a hat,
sunglasses and a mask to prenatal doctor appointments, hired a private
security consultant to monitor the situation and relied on yoga and
meditation to calm her nerves. A few weeks before her due date, the
consultant advised her and her husband to leave the house for safety
reasons, which they ultimately deemed not practical.
Republicans objected, from the start, to the premise of the board
and the idea that the government should play any role in defining
disinformation, according to a spokesman for Jordan.
``The very idea of `disinformation' involves policing speech.
Period,'' he said.
A number of GOP lawmakers likened it to an Orwellian plot and took
aim at Jankowicz for statements she made on social media prior to her
government appointment--mostly expressing doubt about the origins of
Hunter Biden's laptop, but also about coronavirus disinformation and
Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter.
Regarding the blowback Jankowicz encountered, the Jordan aide said
she agreed to serve as the board's public face, and should thus be held
accountable in public.
``She's the top person and a public figure. Any assertion otherwise
is ridiculous,'' he said. Jordan ``has only ever referred to her or
wrote to her in her official capacity,'' he said.
Jankowicz counters that Jordan has ``repeatedly referenced my
statements as a private citizen.''
Taking credit
When she stepped down in May, Sen. Josh Hawley, (R-Mo.), took
credit.
Hawley was among the loudest critics claiming the board was
``policing Americans' speech.'' He also called Jankowicz a ``human
geyser of misinformation,'' citing tweets about Hunter Biden's laptop
in which she suggested it could be part of a Russian disinformation
campaign.
``Only when a patriotic whistleblower came forward with documents
did we learn the truth,'' he tweeted about board-related paperwork that
he says shows the administration's plan for the board was more
extensive than publicly revealed.
Jankowicz, however, says the documents--which Hawley and other
Congressional Republicans have had since last June--contradict many of
the claims he, Hannity, Carlson, Jordan and numerous other figures made
in public and on Fox's airwaves about the board's mission.
``It's hard for boring truths to outpace inflammatory lies,'' said
Jankowicz.
``They're saying the opposite of what's on paper. Everything is
disproven by documents they have in their possession. They're just
assuming nobody is going to read them.''
A response from DHS to a letter Hawley sent in late April seeking
answers states the board ``is an internal working group that does not
have operational capacity.''
Both Jordan and Hawley have zeroed in on an April 28, 2022 draft
talking points memo for a meeting with Twitter executives that
Jankowicz says never came to pass. It proposed Twitter become involved
in ``analytic exchanges'' with DHS and that the board would serve as a
``coordinating mechanism'' for outreach to industry, civil society and
international partners. Hawley's office expressed alarm about plans for
a similar meeting with Facebook's Meta.
``Those are remarkably outward facing activities for a supposedly
internal working group that lacks operational capacity,'' said the
Jordan spokesman.
Yet the ``analytic exchanges,'' says Jankowicz, refer to a pre-
existing DHS initiative titled ``Public-Private Analytic Exchange
Program'' that spans a number of industries and aims to help government
analysts working on, for instance, threats to supply chains and
ransomware.
Further, the next sentence says the board's initial work would
center on ``domestic violent extremism'' and ``irregular migration,''
and said Twitter should be ``thanked'' for its engagement with an
existing cybersecurity agency created under President Donald Trump.
During the 2020 election, it ran a ``Rumor Control'' website that
sought to ``prebunk'' incorrect claims with factual information, reads
page 3 of a Sept. 13, 2021 memorandum.
The materials, spanning between September 2021 to January 2022,
also stipulate the need for protocols to ``protect privacy, civil
rights and civil liberties.'' Its mission would be information sharing
and prescriptive in nature.
The department ``should not attempt to be an all-purpose arbiter of
truth in the public arena'' but focus on disinformation ``impacting DHS
core missions,'' it continues.
``It's been extremely frustrating that these documents haven't been
covered at all,'' said Jankowicz.
In an email response, Hawley's office said emails he obtained show
Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas misled him about when
the board first began meeting. The emails Hawley cited as proof pertain
to preparatory meetings of lower level ``steering group'' aides--not
the board itself.
Hawley also seized on an email that a DHS cybersecurity official
sent Jankowicz and others regarding an opinion piece that ran in the
Washington Post arguing that tech companies should block a Kremlin
propaganda symbol.
Hawley said the information behind the op-ed was funded by a
``liberal dark money group.''
In a statement, Hawley spokeswoman Abigail Marone said:
``Conducting rigorous government oversight and holding Biden
Administration officials accountable is what Missourians expect Josh to
do. And it's great news for the American people that Biden's
Disinformation Board was dissolved because of it.''
Marone also cited language from the board's charter stating that
board members would ``ensure that their respective components
implement, execute and follow board decisions.''
Fox Fixture
Meanwhile, on Fox News, Jankowicz became such a fixture that, when
DHS paused the board, Jordan thanked anchor Sean Hannity for ``the work
you've done in helping get rid of this governance board.''
During this year and last, she's been featured in more than 250
broadcast segments on Fox, whose hosts and guests have repeated false
``assertions of fact'' about her more than 400 times, she alleges.
Hannity called her ``one of the biggest perpetrators and purveyors of
disinformation in the entire country.''
Convinced the firestorm would not end unless she stepped down,
Jankowicz said she chose to exit the department. ``It just felt like
they completely rolled over to Republican lies,'' she said of the Biden
administration.
``What has been shocking is the extent to which it [the harassment]
has continued,'' said Jankowicz, citing at least two incidents of men
snapping photos of her and posting them to social media.
She blames the continued focus of Fox News primetime anchors and
their guests.
Jankowicz ``will come after you,'' Jordan said on Hannity's show,
alleging ``the left'' wants to make people who disagree with them ``not
allowed to talk.'' He retweeted a (now-deleted) video taken out of
context claiming she wanted to edit tweets. Numerous Fox segments
featured a Tik Tok video she'd made more than a year before in which
she did a parody of a ``Mary Poppins'' song.
Jankowicz, who has been involved in community theater most of her
life, said it was ``openly campy'' and one of several educational spots
on disinformation she did on the platform.
Hunter Biden and the Dossier
Republicans also criticized statements Jankowicz had made prior to
taking her position about Hunter Biden's laptop. Jankowicz holds that
``the [Steele] Dossier was real and the Hunter [Biden] laptop story was
false,'' Jordan said on Fox last April.
She did repeatedly express skepticism about the laptop's origins,
which she says was because it was Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy
Giuliani, who handed it to authorities. More than 50 former senior
intelligence officials also called it ``deeply suspicious'' at the
time, and Jankowicz says there is no record of her declaring the laptop
itself wasn't real.
One tweet went viral without the context that it was her live
tweeting an Oct. 20 Presidential debate in which she paraphrased Biden
referencing that same letter. Another cited an intelligence report
concluding that the Kremlin ``used proxies'' to push unsubstantiated
claims about Biden, which she called ``a clear nod to the alleged
Hunter laptop.''
POLITICO itself has not authenticated all the Hunter Biden hard
drive files cited in media reports, but POLITICO reporter Ben
Schreckinger confirmed the authenticity of some emails on the drive in
a 2021 book.
Jankowicz says she never assessed the veracity of a now-infamous
dossier compiled by the former British spy Christopher Steele that made
explosive claims linking Trump to the Kremlin. Rather, she praised its
author in an unrelated matter and debated its origins in a couple of
tweets. In 2019, a special counsel investigation concluded that it
could not determine a criminal conspiracy between Moscow and the Trump
campaign.
She also supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, praised
efforts to crack down on coronavirus misinformation and expressed
concern over Elon Musk's plans to buy Twitter.
Personal Toll
Perhaps ironically, in April 2022 amid the fury, a book Jankowicz
had in the works was published. Its title: ``How to Be a Woman Online''
and survive threats and harassment. It was based on her knowledge of
how Russian disinformation is often presented through a gendered lens.
Since then, she says, she's received tens of thousands of harassing
online posts and hundreds of violent threats. One anonymous poster--who
called her a ``Tranny Jew'' on April 28--said: ``I can't wait for the
open violence phase of this war to kick off.''
As the taunts peaked last spring, she says she pleaded with her
superiors to allow her to speak to the media to ``defend myself.'' Fox
shows were showing her picture and talking about her being pregnant so
she could be easily identified, she said.
``It was about my life, it was about threats to my family and it
was clear the administration was mostly concerned about how to put the
fire out and not how to protect me,'' she said.
When she finally was notified that DHS would pause the board, she
was offered an opportunity to remain in the department but felt she had
no choice but to leave. ``I said `I'm not going to stay if I can't
speak to media,' '' she said.
Jankowicz also questioned the commitment to the project because
they'd ``abandoned'' it so quickly.
Further, because she'd ``become toxic,'' Jankowicz said ``It just
didn't seem worth it.''
DHS cited instances in which both Mayorkas and White House Press
Secretary Jen Psaki defended Jankowicz' work. Mayorkas has told the
Washington Post that the agency ``could have done a better job of
communicating what it [the board] is and what it isn't.''
The board's ``purpose was grossly and intentionally
mischaracterized,'' a DHS spokesperson said in a statement to POLITICO,
and Jankowicz ``was subjected to unjustified and vile personal attacks
and physical threats.''
About 2 weeks later, she gave birth to her first child.
The attacks kept coming. Jankowicz recalled that it was during a
middle-of-the-night bottle feeding when her husband informed her that
Hawley had begun touting the documents he'd obtained from a
whistleblower and Freedom of Information Act request. Two months after
her resignation, Jankowicz sent a letter to Hawley and Sen. Chuck
Grassley, R-Iowa, citing ongoing ``aggressive, sexualized, vulgar and
threatening messages'' she was receiving online, on the phone and even
at home.
Hawley reacted to her plea to ``stop amplifying these lies'' by
tweeting that Jankowicz should testify under oath. By that time, he had
been in possession of the board's internal documents for a number of
weeks, having received them in June, she said.
Today, Jankowicz continues to juggle diaper changes, pumping breast
milk and other aspects of life as a new mother with consultations with
her four sets of attorneys--to address her protective order; to respond
to Jordan's probe; for a ``frivolous'' lawsuit alleging she is
censoring someone; and a tax adviser for her GoFundMe.
When she sues Fox, that will require a fifth lawyer, she says.

old comments by disinformation board director misrepresented online
By SOPHIA TULP
Published 6:04 PM EST, May 14, 2022
CLAIM: Nina Jankowicz, the director of the Department of Homeland
Security's Disinformation Governance Board, said she wants verified
Twitter users to be able to edit other users' tweets.
AP'S ASSESSMENT: Missing context. Comments Jankowicz made during a
January 2021 presentation, more than a year before she was named to
lead the disinformation board, are being misconstrued. A video of
Jankowicz's full remarks shows she was explaining an existing program
offered by Twitter that allows certain users to write notes
contextualizing claims made in tweets. Jankowicz did not say she
personally wanted verified users to edit tweets, nor has she said she
plans to implement something similar through the board.
THE FACTS: Jankowicz's comments, made more than a year ago during
an online call hosted by a school librarians' association, are being
taken out of context to suggest she recently expressed a desire to have
select Twitter users edit peoples' tweets.
``There it is, folks: Nina Jankowicz, head of Biden's so-called
`Disinformation Governance Board' wants to give blue checks the ability
to edit others' tweets,'' one Twitter user wrote Friday, sharing a
minute-long video of Jankowicz speaking during the call.
``Biden's `Ministry of Truth' director says she wants `verified
people' like her to be able to edit people's tweets so they can `add
context to certain tweets,' '' wrote another user, without mentioning
the video is not recent.
The clip was also shared on Facebook and by conservative political
pundits.
Assertions that Jankowicz was expressing a personal desire to
launch a tweet-editing program, especially in her capacity as the
director of the disinformation board, are misleading.
The comments were taken from a 90-minute virtual conversation
hosted by the Georgia Independent School Librarians on Jan. 27, 2021,
in which Jankowicz discussed the state of disinformation. More than an
hour into her presentation, another member on the call asked Jankowicz
about a Twitter program they had heard about.
``I heard something about Twitter is now or getting ready to start
allowing other Twitter users to--help me out here, that's where I sort
of lost track of `what is it Twitter's letting people do?' '' the
speaker asked.
``I haven't looked into this in a huge way yet because it just came
out, and I am eligible for it because I am verified,'' Jankowicz
responded. ``But there are a lot of people who shouldn't be verified,
who aren't, you know, legit, in my opinion. I mean, they are real
people, but they're not trustworthy. Anyway, so verified people can
essentially start to edit Twitter, the same sort of way that Wikipedia
is, so they can add context to certain tweets. ``
Jankowicz used air quotations when she said the word ``edit'' and
also mentioned that such notations would give context ``so that people
have a fuller picture rather than just an individual claim on a
tweet.''
The Twitter pilot program, called Birdwatch, had been announced 3
days prior, on Jan. 25, 2021. At the time, Twitter described it as ``a
new community-driven approach to help address misleading information.''
Twitter stated that the program would allow pilot participants to
write notes that would add factual context to tweets that contained
potentially misleading claims. Participants would not be able to change
the actual tweets. The company said the notes would be reviewed by
others and visible on a separate site, not on Twitter.
The clip of Jankowicz being shared online only shows her talking
about the program features. But her full remarks make clear she was
explaining the Twitter program in response to a question, not proposing
her own ideas. Further, she never said she herself wanted to allow
verified Twitter users to edit people's tweets.
Later on the call, Jankowicz said, ``I like the idea of adding more
context to claims and tweets and other content online rather than just
removing it,'' but she also offered caveats about the program,
including that verified users aren't always trustworthy, and that the
social media company was asking volunteers to ``do their work for
them.''
``I'm not sure it's the solution,'' she stated, adding she likely
wouldn't be participating because of time constraints.
DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The AP works with Twitter to elevate credible news and information
on the platform. The collaboration is part of AP's robust news
verification efforts, including work to add context to misleading
content and reduce the circulation of misinformation online.
DHS has released few details on how the Disinformation Governance
Board will function and what powers it will have. The effort has drawn
criticism since it was announced in late April, with some likening it
to a dystopic attempt to punish people for certain views. Others have
expressed concern it could violate freedom of speech.
DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has said the board would examine
how the agency currently counters disinformation and make sure it
``does not infringe on freedom of speech, rights of privacy, civil
rights and civil liberties,'' the AP reported.

Mr. Bishop. The gentleman yields back.
The gentlelady, Ms. Clarke, is recognized.
Ms. Clarke. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
As I had stated in my conversation with the panel just a
few minutes ago, that I am concerned that my colleagues are
attempting to make any discussion about combating
disinformation so politically toxic that no one will touch it.
That's a threat. It's a threat to our way of life.
I'd like to ask you, Dr. Miller-Idriss, what type of threat
does it pose to our national security? Because this is the
Homeland Security Committee. A lot of the conversation we've
had here today really should be in the Judiciary Committee. But
let's speak specifically about national security.
Ms. Miller-Idriss. Well, the kinds of propaganda and
disinformation that we work on, like the great replacement
conspiracy theory, the false great replacement conspiracy
theory, motivate terrorist actors. Even when there's not a
specific conspiracy theory like that or a specific manifesto,
we see that these toxic on-line cultures motivate shootings,
like in Highland Park or Uvalde or in Texas this past weekend.
So I think a lot of what we're seeing here is that we have
a lot of agreement. Nobody wants censorship, actually, I think.
None of us want censorship at all. I think if you're not going
to have censorship and banning, then there has to be something
at the other end to equip people to recognize and reject.
What happens in the middle is how you determine what
actually that disinformation is. I think there's some very
clear cases. Like, I think most people, I hope, would agree
that the great replacement conspiracy theory is extremely
harmful disinformation that has caused terrorist shootings,
that leads to terrorist acts.
I hope that we can get some help from the Government for
the communities that keep coming to us desperate for help,
because I really feel bad for them, and we're trying to equip
them with better tools.
Ms. Clarke. Thank you.
I find myself sort-of trying to figure out, when I hear my
colleagues talk about the fact that there's a right to free
speech, 100 percent, full stop, and then I hear about all the
States that are banning books right now, there just seems to be
such a major contradiction. It just blows my mind.
With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. Bishop. I thank the gentlelady for yielding back.
Let's see. I guess we have votes on the floor. So we
certainly won't proceed to a final or a further round.
I do thank the witnesses for the valuable testimony. It is
interesting to me, as I hear all of this, it's something that
begs digging into further. I think we miss each other in
terminology going back and forth even to the point just made by
Dr. Miller-Idriss.
If someone advocates a, what did you call it, a great
replacement theory, you look at U.S. v. Brandenburg, that's
clearly protected First Amendment speech.
Then the question--I respect Ms. Clarke's inquiry she's
repeated, and Mr. Ivey's, that there's a question of how to
combat disinformation. But there's certainly things you can't
do. The Government can't prohibit that which the Supreme Court
has said for a long time is clearly protected.
So it's a confounding area but one that requires--and I
agree with--I appreciate the Ranking Member's comment that it's
something that warrants further examination. I hope we'll have
a chance to do that further in another continuation hearing.
I thank the witnesses for their valuable testimony and the
Members for their questions.
The Members of the subcommittee may have some additional
questions for the witnesses, and we would ask the witnesses to
respond to these in writing. Pursuant to Committee Rule VII(D),
the hearing record will be open for 10 days.
Without objection, the committee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 3:43 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
