STRATEGIC COMPETITION IN THE ARCTIC

----------

Tuesday, July 18, 2023

U.S. House of Representatives,
Committee on Homeland Security,
Subcommittee on Transportation and
Maritime Security,
Washington, DC.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:58 a.m., in
room 310, Cannon House Office Building, Hon. Carlos Gimenez
[Chairman of the subcommittee] presiding.
Present: Representatives Gimenez, Higgins, LaLota, Lee,
Thanedar, Payne, and Garcia.
Also present: Representatives Green and Thompson.
Chairman Gimenez. The Committee on Homeland Security will
come to order.
Without objection, the Chair may declare the subcommittee
in recess at any point.
The purpose of this hearing is to discuss the existing and
future security threats resulting from strategic competition in
the Arctic region and how the United States Coast Guard and
Department of Homeland Security can effectively respond to and
address these threats.
I now recognize myself for an opening statement.
I want to thank our three witnesses that are appearing
before our subcommittee this morning.
Today, our subcommittee will discuss strategic competition
in the Arctic region and its impact on U.S. homeland and
national security interests.
The Arctic is critically important to the United States'
strategic interests. The United States is one of only 8
countries globally with territory above the Arctic Circle. So,
what happens in the Arctic directly impacts the United States
and its citizens.
Historically, our adversaries have targeted the United
States in the High North to undermine our national security.
During World War II, the forces of Imperial Japan saw strategic
value in occupying the Aleutian Islands off the coast of
Alaska, going so far as to seize some islands within the chain.
During the Cold War, Soviet aircraft and submarines
regularly attempted to breach U.S. sovereignty, air space,
sovereign air space, and territorial waters in Alaska. The
United States' early warning missile defense capabilities
focused on the Arctic as a potential entry point for Soviet
nuclear missiles into the North American air space.
Today, we face a growing number of challenges from near-
peer competitors. Over the last decade, Russia has been
building up its military capabilities in the Arctic, including
its fleet of heavy icebreakers. Vladimir Putin has repeatedly
stated his vision for the Northern Sea Route to become an
alternative to the Suez Canal to facilitate faster trade
between Europe and Asia.
More recently, Russia is foregoing cooperation on Arctic
issues with other Arctic states as it continues its illegal and
unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, thus breaking decades of
precedent, in which the 8 Arctic states collaborated closely on
scientific research, environmental protection, and maritime
safety.
Additionally, the People's Republic of China, despite
having no sovereign territory within the Arctic region, are
attempting to stake out interests in the Arctic affairs.
In 2018, the CCP declared the PRC to be a so-called near-
Arctic nation. The CCP and state-owned entities own and operate
icebreakers and other polar-capable ships. During the last
decade, these entities showed an increased willingness to
transit their vessels through Arctic waters. The United States
cannot afford to ignore this increased interest in the Arctic
from near-peer competitors.
As sea ice recedes and technology improves, traffic in the
Arctic's maritime channels will continue to increase. This will
lead to greater scientific research, natural resources
exploration, fishing, and tourism taking place in the Arctic
region.
Additionally, our military relies upon the flight routes
through the Arctic to deploy personnel, equipment, and other
material to theaters around the world.
The United States Coast Guard is an active presence in the
Arctic for decades, providing invaluable search-and-rescue
capabilities, patrolling U.S. waters, and upholding U.S.
sovereignty at sea. Their presence enforces U.S. customs and
laws concerning trade and fishing and supports the military's
sustained presence at bases around Alaska.
Coast Guard's icebreakers have long been an integral
component of the U.S. Government's presence in the Arctic.
However, I am concerned with the delays the Coast Guard is
experiencing with the new development and deployment of new
Polar Security Cutters that will negatively impact the Coast
Guard's ability to carry out its diverse mission set and
protect the homeland in the Arctic.
Going forward, this subcommittee needs to play an active
role in ensuring that the United States can effectively respond
to threats in the Arctic.
I am grateful to have our three witnesses to share with us
their perspective on the geopolitical situation in the Arctic
and ways in which the Coast Guard, the Department of Homeland
Security, and the wider U.S. Government can deter threats and
protect our homeland in the Arctic. Thank you again. I look
forward to your testimonies.

Chairman Gimenez. Now, I now recognize the Ranking Member,
the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Thanedar, for his opening
statement.
Mr. Thanedar. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you for calling
today's hearing.
I thank all of our witnesses for being here today. Good
morning to all of you.
With a dramatic change in climate and growing aggression
from other nations, the Arctic has never been more central to
America's national security. Temperatures in the Arctic are
rising at three times the global average. Ice levels have began
to recede dramatically, creating both environmental catastrophe
and conflict over trade routes, natural resources, fishing
rights, and global power.
I am eager to learn more about how the melting ice in the
Arctic will affect our national security, as well as global
economics and competition.
The region also provides tremendous opportunity for
cooperation, from scientific discovery to international trade.
The Arctic is home to almost 4 million people, including
enduring indigenous populations whose continued safety,
sovereignty, cultures, and livelihoods must be protected.
The U.S. Coast Guard plays an essential role in
safeguarding a rules-based order in Far North. Investing in a
resilient Arctic community through disaster relief, scientific
mission support, search and rescue, law enforcement, and
community relations, the Coast Guard bridges the gap between
the United States' military presence and our humanitarian
efforts.
Unfortunately, the Coast Guard's ice-breaking capabilities
are outmatched by our enemies. Rising threats from China and
Russia pose a serious risk to American prosperity and security.
I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today on how
our Nation can invest in the infrastructure and capabilities
needed to maintain a powerful presence in the harsh conditions
of the Arctic.
The Arctic does not belong to one nation. It is essential
that the United States support robust international
organizations to foster cooperation in the region. This work
has been hampered by non-Arctic nations, like China, seeking to
profit from illegal fishing and other harmful activities, as
well as Russian aggression against Ukraine that has shattered
the fragile trust needed to bring diverse nations together on
issues in the Far North.
I look forward to learning more today about the mechanisms
for cooperation in the Arctic, including international
organizations and how this has been hampered by the growing
threats we face. I am glad to see the committee continuing our
work on this subject. It is essential that Congress continues
to invest in the Coast Guard's capabilities in the Arctic,
including through robust funding for new Polar Security
Cutters.
Thank you again to Chairman Gimenez for calling this
hearing and to all of our witnesses. I am excited. I am looking
forward to your testimony.
With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.

Chairman Gimenez. Thank you to the Ranking Member, Mr.
Thanedar.
Other Members of the committee are reminded that opening
statements may be submitted for the record.
[The statement of Ranking Member Thompson follows:]
Statement of Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson
July 18, 2023
The Arctic is a region of increasing importance to our efforts to
protect the homeland. Democrats on the Homeland Security Committee held
multiple hearings and briefings on security challenges in the Arctic
when we were in the Majority, and I am glad to see the current Majority
continuing that focus.
We must continue to come together in a bipartisan fashion to ensure
the challenges facing our Nation at our northernmost border receive the
attention they deserve. Climate change and melting sea ice are opening
Arctic waters to increased maritime activity, from shipping to fishing
to tourism to offshore energy exploration. Global competitors including
Russia and China are making significant investments to take full
advantage of the changing circumstances in the region, and the United
States must be ready to respond.
The Coast Guard's efforts to secure and protect the maritime domain
are central to U.S. interests in the Arctic and demand Congress'
attention. The Coast Guard's icebreaking capabilities are sorely
lacking, making it difficult for the Coast Guard to maintain necessary
presence in the region. With Congress' support, the Coast Guard has
begun making historic investments in the Polar Security Cutter program
to help make up for decades of negligence. This will be a long-term
effort, so Congress must continue making such investments and ensure
shipbuilding efforts stay on budget and meet critical deadlines.
The United States must also strategize for the coming years and
decades in the Arctic, since we know that changes in the region will
only continue to accelerate. To that end, the Biden-Harris
administration's National Strategy for the Arctic Region, published
last October, is a huge step in the right direction. The Strategy
places appropriate focus on climate change and environmental
protection, as well as on security. Plans for the Arctic must account
for the severity of changes to sea ice and warming temperatures, which
can only be understood by following the science on climate change.
Importantly, the Strategy also highlights the need for consultation and
coordination with indigenous communities, as well as the need for
international cooperation and governance.
The Coast Guard cannot address the challenges in the Arctic on its
own and must work hand-in-hand with Alaskan native tribes and
communities and international allies and partners. I thank today's
witnesses for sharing their expertise about homeland security
priorities in the Arctic and what Congress can do to support the Coast
Guard and the rest of the Federal Government in their efforts.

Chairman Gimenez. Again, I am pleased to have a
distinguished panel of witnesses before us today on this
critical topic.
[Witnesses sworn.]
Chairman Gimenez. Let the record reflect that the witnesses
have answered in the affirmative. Thank you and please be
seated.
I would now like to formally introduce our witnesses.
Mr. Ronald O'Rourke is a specialist in naval affairs at the
Congressional Research Service. Since starting at CRS in 1984,
Mr. O'Rourke has written many reports for Congress on various
issues relating to the Navy, the Coast Guard, defense
acquisition, China's naval forces and maritime territorial
disputes, the Arctic, and the international security
environment. He is one of the most respected authorities on
naval issues and of special interest to this subcommittee, the
Coast Guard's icebreaker fleet.
Mr. Luke Coffey is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.
His work focuses on national security issues in Europe,
Eurasia, and the Arctic. As a decorated veteran of the United
States Army and former senior special advisor to United Kingdom
defence secretary, Liam Fox, Mr. Coffey brings a unique
perspective to this field. Mr. Coffey previously testified
before the subcommittee in his prior role as director of The
Allison Center for Foreign Policy Studies at The Heritage
Foundation and we are glad to have him back.
Dr. Esther Brimmer is the James H. Binger senior fellow in
global governance at the Council on Foreign Relations. Dr.
Brimmer's work focuses on international organizations and
transatlantic relations. During her time at the Council, Dr.
Brimmer served as the project director for the 2017 Counsel
Task Force report ``Arctic Imperatives: Reinforcing U.S.
Strategy on America's Fourth Coast''. In addition to posts in
academia, the private sector, and with the large nonprofit
organizations, Dr. Brimmer previously served as the assistant
secretary of state for international organization affairs and
worked on the Department of State's policy planning staff.
I thank each of you distinguished witnesses for being here
today.
I now recognize Mr. O'Rourke for 5 minutes to summarize his
opening statement.

STATEMENT OF RONALD O'ROURKE, SPECIALIST IN NAVAL AFFAIRS,
CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE

Mr. O'Rourke. Chairman Gimenez, Ranking Member Thanedar,
distinguished Members of the subcommittee, thank you for the
opportunity to appear before you today to discuss strategic
competition in the Arctic. With your permission, I'll submit my
written statement for the record and, as you requested,
summarize it here briefly.
In the CRS report on the Arctic, I'm the author of the
section on strategic competition in the region and I'll be
happy to discuss various aspects of that topic during the Q&A.
The subcommittee asked me to focus my prepared testimony on
the Coast Guard's polar icebreakers, which I have been covering
in detail since 2008 when I initiated my CRS report on the
topic.
In connection with strategic competition, it can be noted
that the Coast Guard's polar icebreakers don't simply break
ice. They are multi-mission cutters that conduct a variety of
operations in polar waters. U.S. polar ice operations conducted
in large part by the icebreakers support 9 of the Coast Guard's
11 statutory missions.
In general, the icebreakers conduct and support scientific
research in the polar regions. They defend U.S. sovereignty in
the Arctic by helping to maintain a U.S. presence in
territorial waters in the region. They defend other U.S.
interests in the polar regions, including economic interests in
waters that are within the U.S. exclusive economic zone north
of Alaska. They monitor sea traffic in the Arctic, including
ships bound for the United States. They conduct other Coast
Guard missions, such as search and rescue, law enforcement, and
protection of marine resources in Arctic waters, including U.S.
territorial waters north of Alaska.
Discussions of U.S. Arctic capabilities often note the lack
of infrastructure in the region. With their built-in
capabilities, the Coast Guard's polar icebreakers act as a form
of mobile infrastructure, something that can be seen when the
icebreaker, Healy, for example, uses its built-in science
support facilities to support embarked contingents of Arctic
researchers.
The Coast Guard testified in April and June that it had
recently signed out a new fleet mix analysis that concluded
that the Coast Guard will require a total of 8 to 9 polar
icebreakers. Prior to that, Coast Guard officials had stated
that the service would need at least 6 icebreakers, including 3
capable of breaking heavy polar ice.
The Coast Guard initiated the Polar Security Cutter, or
PSC, program for procuring new heavy polar icebreakers in its
fiscal year 2013 budget. From fiscal year 2013 to 2016, the
program received only minor funding. Starting in fiscal year
2017, the program has received significant funding and the
first 2 PSCs are now fully funded.
The Coast Guard originally aimed to have the first PSC
delivered in 2024, but the ship's estimated delivery date has
been delayed repeatedly. Given the degree of design completion
that GAO has reported, construction of the ship might begin no
earlier than 2024. If so, and if the ship takes at least 4
years to build, which might be a reasonable estimate for a lead
ship of this size and complexity, then the first PSC might be
delivered no earlier than 2028. Admiral Fagan reportedly
provided a similar estimate in testimony on the Senate side
last week. If the first ship is delivered in 2028, that will be
20 years after I initiated the icebreaker report.
Recent substantial cost growth on other Navy and Coast
Guard ship-building programs raises a question regarding the
potential for a possibly comparable amount of cost growth to
occur on the PSC program. If there's substantial cost growth in
the PSC program, that could raise a question about whether to
grant some form of contract relief to the shipbuilder, as
occurred in the Coast Guard's Offshore Patrol Cutter program.
One option for Congress would be to ask CBO to conduct a
more refined analysis of the potential for cost growth in the
PSC program. In addition to the PSC program, the Coast Guard is
requesting funding to purchase an existing commercially
available polar icebreaker that would be modified to become a
Coast Guard polar icebreaker, so as to help augment the Coast
Guard's polar icebreaking capability. I'll be happy to discuss
that in the Q&A.
As important as icebreakers are, improving the Coast
Guard's capabilities in the region would include making
investments in other things as well, including manned aircraft,
UAVs, communications, and shore facilities. The current project
to make improvements at the Port of Nome promises to improve
the Coast Guard's ability to maintain a presence in operations
in the Arctic by eliminating the need for polar icebreakers to
steam all the way down to Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Islands
to be resupplied before returning to the Arctic Ocean.
Chairman Gimenez, this concludes my opening statement. I'll
be happy to respond to any questions the subcommittee may have.

introduction
Chairman Gimenez, Ranking Member Thanedar, distinguished Members of
the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you
today to discuss strategic competition in the Arctic.
As part of my work as the CRS specialist for naval affairs, I am
the head of the CRS Arctic team, the coordinator of the CRS overview
report on the Arctic,\1\ and the author of the CRS report on the Coast
Guard's Polar Security Cutter (PSC) program.\2\ The Arctic and PSC
reports were initiated in 2010 and 2008, respectively, and have been
updated periodically since then, most recently on July 5 and July 10,
2023, respectively. My other periodically updated CRS reports include
the CRS report on the defense implications of great power competition,
which was initiated in 2014,\3\ and the CRS report on U.S.-China
strategic competition in the South and East China Seas, which was
initiated in 2012.\4\ My biography is in the Appendix at the end of
this statement.

arctic geopolitical environment
The CRS Arctic overview report's discussion of the Arctic
geopolitical environment covers the evolution of the Arctic
geopolitical environment since the end of the Cold War, the emergence
of great power competition (i.e., strategic competition) in the Arctic,
the impact on the Arctic of Russia's war in Ukraine, Russian and
Chinese activities in the Arctic, and military (including U.S. Coast
Guard) operations in the Arctic.\5\ The discussion in that report
provides a geopolitical context for the material presented below, which
focuses on Coast Guard polar icebreakers, Arctic search and rescue
(SAR), and a U.S. Arctic strategic seaport.

coast guard polar icebreakers
Multiple Polar Missions (Not Just Icebreaking)
Within the U.S. Government, the Coast Guard is the U.S. agency
responsible for polar icebreaking. The Coast Guard's polar icebreakers,
however, do not simply break ice--they are multi-mission cutters that
conduct a variety of operations in polar waters. U.S. polar ice
operations conducted in large part by the Coast Guard's polar
icebreakers support 9 of the Coast Guard's 11 statutory missions.\6\
The roles of U.S. polar icebreakers can be summarized as follows:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\6\ The 11 missions are marine safety; search and rescue; aids to
navigation; living marine resources (fisheries law enforcement); marine
environmental protection; ice operations; ports, waterways and coastal
security; drug interdiction; migrant interdiction; defense readiness;
other law enforcement. The two statutory missions not supported by
polar ice operations are illegal drug interdiction and undocumented
migrant interdiction. (Department of Homeland Security, Polar
Icebreaking Recapitalization Project Mission Need Statement, Version
1.0, approved by DHS June 28, 2013, p. 10.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

conducting and supporting scientific research in the Arctic
and Antarctic;

defending U.S. sovereignty in the Arctic by helping to
maintain a U.S. presence in U.S. territorial waters in the
region;

defending other U.S. interests in polar regions, including
economic interests in waters that are within the U.S. exclusive
economic zone (EEZ) north of Alaska;

monitoring sea traffic in the Arctic, including ships bound
for the United States; and

conducting other typical Coast Guard missions (such as
search and rescue, law enforcement, and protection of marine
resources) in Arctic waters, including U.S. territorial waters
north of Alaska.\7\

changes to Government Accountability Office, Coast Guard[:]Efforts to
Identify Arctic Requirements Are Ongoing, but More Communication about
Agency Planning Efforts Would Be Beneficial, GAO-10-870, September
2010, p. 53.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Polar (Not Just Arctic) Operations
The Coast Guard's large icebreakers are called polar icebreakers
rather than Arctic icebreakers because they perform missions in both
the Arctic and Antarctic. Operations to support National Science
Foundation (NSF) research activities in both polar regions account for
a significant portion of U.S. polar icebreaker operations.
Supporting NSF research in the Antarctic focuses on performing an
annual mission, called Operation Deep Freeze (ODF), to break through
Antarctic sea ice so as to reach and resupply McMurdo Station, the
large U.S. Antarctic research station located on the shore of McMurdo
Sound, near the Ross Ice Shelf. The Coast Guard states that Polar Star,
the Coast Guard's only currently-operational heavy polar icebreaker,
``spends the [northern hemisphere] winter [i.e., the southern
hemisphere summer] breaking ice near Antarctica in order to refuel and
resupply McMurdo Station. When the mission is complete, the Polar Star
returns to dry dock [in Seattle] in order to complete critical
maintenance and prepare it for the next ODF mission. Once out of dry
dock, it's back to Antarctica, and the cycle repeats itself.''\8\ The
Coast Guard's medium polar icebreaker, Healy, spends most of its
operational time in the Arctic supporting NSF research activities and
performing other operations.

Required Numbers of Coast Guard Polar Icebreakers
The Coast Guard testified in April and June 2023 that it had
recently completed a new fleet mix analysis that concluded that the
Coast Guard will require a total of 8 to 9 polar icebreakers to perform
its various polar (i.e., Arctic and Antarctic) missions in coming
years:

At an April 18, 2023, hearing on the Coast Guard's proposed
fiscal year 2024 budget before the Coast Guard and Maritime
Transportation subcommittee of the House Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee, the Commandant of the Coast Guard,
Admiral Linda L. Fagan, stated: ``We recently--I recently
signed out a fleet mix analysis that indicates we need eight to
nine icebreakers.''\9\ Admiral Fagan's testimony did not
otherwise characterize the results of the fleet mix
analysis.\10\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\9\ CQ transcript of hearing.
\10\ Congressional offices seeking further information on the fleet
mix analysis may contact the author of this CRS report.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

At a June 21, 2023, hearing before the same subcommittee on
the Coast Guard's emerging challenges and statutory needs, the
Vice Commandant of the Coast Guard, Admiral Steven D. Poulin,
similarly stated: ``We were on a trajectory to build the polar
security cutters, but we recently delivered to this committee
and other committees our fleet mix analysis, and in that fleet
mix analysis we concluded that we likely need eight to nine new
icebreakers. Some of those will be heavy icebreakers like the
polar security cutter that's being built at Bollinger,
Mississippi. Others may be Arctic security cutters [ASCs, i.e.,
medium polar icebreakers].''\11\ Admiral Poulin's testimony,
like Admiral Fagan's, did not otherwise characterize the
results of the fleet mix analysis.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\11\ CQ transcript of hearing. The Coast Guard in late 2020 began
referring to its envisioned new medium polar icebreakers as Arctic
Security Cutters, or ASCs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prior to this new fleet mix analysis, Coast Guard officials had
stated that the service in coming years would need at least 6 polar
icebreakers, including 3 capable of breaking heavy polar ice.\12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\12\ The Coast Guard testified in February 2020, for example, that:

The 2010 High Latitude Mission Analysis Report (HL MAR) identified
the need for 6 new polar icebreakers (at least 3 of which must be
heavy) under the assumption that, in the future, the Coast Guard would
be required to perform 9 of its 11 statutory missions year-round in the
Arctic, and meet all icebreaking needs in support of the United States
Antarctic Program.
In 2017, the Coast Guard's Center for Arctic Study and Policy
completed an addendum to the HL MAR. The objectives were to provide a
broad overview of changes in the polar regions over the last 7 years
and to provide specific information for use in determining potential
impacts on mission areas in the polar regions. This addendum provides
confidence in the original findings and encourages the sustained
reliance on its initial recommendations on the Nation's need for 6
icebreakers, 3 of which must be heavy icebreakers.
(Testimony of Admiral Charles W. Ray, Coast Guard Vice Commandant,
on ``Arctic Security Issues,'' before the House Homeland Security
Subcommittee on Transportation & Maritime Security, February 5, 2020,
p. 9.)

In January 2021, then-Commandant of the Coast Guard Admiral Karl
Schultz stated publicly that the Coast Guard would ideally like to have
a fleet of 6 PSCs and 3 new ASCs, for a total fleet of 9 PSCs and ASCs.
(See Jon Harper, ``SNA News: Coast Guard Wants Budget `Booster Shot,'

Nuclear Icebreakers Are Not An Option for Coast Guard,'' USNI News,
January 14, 2021; Cal Biesecker, ``With More Resources, Coast Guard
Sees Need For Nine Polar Icebreakers,'' Defense Daily, January 14,
2021. See also Stew Magnuson, ``Coast Guard Ship Modernization Under
Full Steam,'' National Defense, March 3, 2021.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Current Coast Guard Polar Icebreakers
The operational U.S. polar icebreaking fleet currently consists of
one heavy polar icebreaker, Polar Star, and one medium polar
icebreaker, Healy.\13\ In addition to Polar Star, the Coast Guard has a
second heavy polar icebreaker, Polar Sea. Polar Sea, however, suffered
an engine failure in June 2010 and has been nonoperational since then.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\13\ A heavy polar icebreaker generally has more capability for
breaking through polar ice than a medium polar icebreaker, which in
turn generally has more capability for breaking through polar ice than
a light polar icebreaker. In the International Association of
Classification Societies (IASC) classifications for polar-class ships,
heavy polar icebreakers are equivalent to Polar Class 1 or 2 (PC1 or
PC2) class ships, medium polar icebreakers are equivalent to PC3 or PC4
class ships, and light polar icebreakers are equivalent to PC5 or PC6
class ships. PC1 through PC5 are ships capable of year-round operation
in all polar waters (PC1); moderate multi-year ice conditions (PC2);
second-year ice, which may include multi-year ice inclusions (PC3);
thick first-year ice, which may include old ice inclusions (PC4); or
medium first-year ice, which may include old ice inclusions (PC5). PC6
are ships capable of summer/autumn operation in medium first-year ice,
which may include old ice inclusions. (Source: Requirements concerning
Polar Class, International Association of Classification Societies,
undated, including Revision 4 of December 2019, Table 1, entitled Polar
Class descriptions, p. I1-2.) For a table showing major polar
icebreakers of the world organized by PC class, see Table B-1 in CRS
Report RL34391, Coast Guard Polar Security Cutter (Polar Icebreaker)
Program: Background and Issues for Congress, by Ronald O'Rourke.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Polar Star and Polar Sea entered service in 1976 and 1978,
respectively, and are now well beyond their originally intended 30-year
service lives. The Coast Guard in recent years has invested millions of
dollars to overhaul, repair, and extend the service life of Polar Star,
but as a result of its advancing age, the ship's material condition has
nevertheless become increasingly fragile, if not precarious. During its
annual deployments to McMurdo Station in Antarctica, shipboard
equipment frequently breaks, and shipboard fires have occurred.\14\
Replacements for many of the ship's components are no longer
commercially available. To help keep Polar Star operational, the Coast
Guard is using Polar Sea as a source of replacement parts.

Old Stepchild of the U.S. Military-Industrial Complex,'' Los Angeles

Icebreaker Catches Fire Returning from Antarctica,'' Arctic Today,
March 2, 2019; Calvin Biesecker, ``Fire Breaks Out On Coast Guard's
Aging, and Only, Heavy Icebreaker,'' Defense Daily, March 1, 2019.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
PSC Program
The PSC program was initiated in the Coast Guard's fiscal year 2013
budget submission, and envisages the acquisition of at least 3 new PSCs
(i.e., heavy polar icebreakers), to be followed years from now by the
acquisition of additional new ASCs (i.e., medium polar icebreakers).
The PSC program was previously known as the polar icebreaker (PIB)
program. Changing the program's name to the PSC program is intended to
call attention to the fact that the Coast Guard's polar icebreakers
perform a variety of missions relating to national security, not just
icebreaking.\15\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Renames New Icebreaker Program `Polar Security Cutter,' '' USNI News,
September 27, 2018. See also Sydney J. Freedberg Jr., ``With Funding In
Peril, Coast Guard Pushes Icebreaker As `Polar Security Cutter,' ''
Breaking Defense, October 29, 2018.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The PSC program is managed by a Coast Guard-Navy Integrated Program
Office (IPO).\16\ The Navy and Coast Guard in 2020 estimated the total
procurement costs of the first 3 PSCs in then-year dollars as $1,038
million (i.e., about $1.0 billion) for the first ship, $794 million for
the second ship, and $841 million for the third ship, for a combined
estimated cost of $2,673 million (i.e., about $2.7 billion). A
Government Accountability Office (GAO) report that was released on
April 20, 2023, and which reports on the status of major DHS
acquisition programs as of September 30, 2022, states that as of June
2022, the combined estimated procurement cost of the 3 PSCs was $2,789
million,\17\ which is $116 million (about 4.3 percent) more than the
figure of $2,673 million.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\16\ A key aim in establishing the IPO was to permit the Navy to
share its ship-procurement best practices with the Coast Guard so as to
help the Coast Guard reduce the time and cost needed to design and
procure the PSCs.

On April 23, 2019, the Coast Guard-Navy Integrated Program Office
for the PSC program awarded a fixed-price, incentive-firm contract for
the detail design and construction (DD&C) of the first PSC to Halter
Marine Inc. of Pascagoula, MS, a shipyard that was owned at the time by
Singapore Technologies (ST) Engineering. The DD&C contract includes
options for building the second and third PSCs. On December 29, 2021,
the Coast Guard exercised a fixed price incentive option to its
contract with Halter Marine Inc. for the second PSC. In November 2022,
ST Engineering sold Halter Marine to Louisiana-based Bollinger
Shipyards. The former Halter Marine is now called Bollinger Mississippi
Shipbuilding.\18\

USNI News, November 6, 2022.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The PSC program is using the parent design approach, meaning that
the design of the PSC (Figure 1) is based on an existing icebreaker
design. A key aim in using the parent design approach is to reduce
cost, schedule, and technical risk in the PSC program. The parent
design is German design for Polar Stern II (also spelled Polarstern
II), a ship that is to be built as the replacement for Polarstern,
Germany's current polar research and supply icebreaker.

The PSC program has received a total of $1,881.8 million in
procurement funding through fiscal year 2023, including $300 million
provided through the Navy's shipbuilding account ($150 million each in
fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2018), and the remainder provided
through the Coast Guard's Procurement, Construction, and Improvements
(PC&I) account. The procurement of the first two PSCs is fully funded,
and the Coast Guard has started to fund the third PSC. The Coast
Guard's proposed fiscal year 2024 budget requests $170.0 million in
continued procurement funding for the PSC program.
The Coast Guard originally aimed to have the first PSC delivered in
2024, but the ship's estimated delivery date has subsequently been
delayed repeatedly. An April 2023 GAO report states that as of August
2022, about 41 percent of the ship's overall design had been
completed,\19\ raising a question as to how much time the use of the
German parent design has in practice saved in designing the PSC. Given
the degree of design completion as of August 2022, construction of the
ship might begin no earlier than 2024. If so, and if the ship takes at
least 4 years to build, which might be a reasonable estimate for
building a lead ship (i.e., first ship in the class) of the PSC's size
and complexity, then the first PSC might be delivered no earlier than
2028. Admiral Fagan reportedly provided a similar estimate in testimony
at a July 13, 2023, hearing on the Coast Guard's budget before the
Oceans, Fisheries, Climate Change, and Manufacturing subcommittee of
the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee.\20\

Cost growth in other Navy and Coast Guard shipbuilding programs
reported in the Navy's fiscal year 2024 budget submission and a June
2023 GAO report includes the following:

About 10 percent cost growth since the Navy's fiscal year
2023 budget submission in estimated unit procurement costs for
Navy Virginia-class attack submarines;\21\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\21\ The estimated unit procurement cost of Virginia-class attack
submarines to be procured in fiscal year 2025-fiscal year 2027 is about
10 percent higher in the Navy's fiscal year 2024 budget submission than
in the Navy's fiscal year 2023 budget submission. For more on the

About 40 percent cost growth between 2012 and 2022 in the
estimated the total program acquisition cost of the Coast
Guard's Offshore Patrol Cutter (OPC) program;\22\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\22\ A June 2023 GAO report on the OPC program states: ``The OPC's
total acquisition cost estimate increased from $12.5 billion to $17.6
billion between 2012 and 2022. The program attributes the 40 percent
increase to many factors, including restructuring the stage 1 contract
[for OPCs 1 through 4] and recompeting the stage 2 requirement [for
OPCs 5 through 15] in response to a disruption caused by Hurricane
Michael, and increased infrastructure costs for homeports and
facilities, among other things.'' (Government Accountability Office,

\23\ In the Navy's fiscal year 2021 budget submission, the 4 TAO-
205s programmed for procurement during the 5-year period fiscal year
2021-fiscal year 2025 had an average estimated procurement cost of
$556.9 million per ship, while in the Navy's fiscal year 2024 budget
submission, the 6 TAO-205s programmed for procurement during the 5-year
period fiscal year 2024-fiscal year 2028 have an average estimated
procurement cost of $843.4 million, a figure that is 51 percent
greater. For more on the TAO-205 program, see CRS Report R43546, Navy

About 82 percent cost growth since fiscal year 2022 in the
estimated unit procurement cost of the Navy's first TAGOS-25
class ocean surveillance ship.\24\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\24\ The Navy in fiscal year 2022 procured the first of a planned
class of 7 new TAGOS-25 class ocean surveillance ships at a cost of
$434.4 million. The Navy's fiscal year 2024 budget submission shows
that the ship's estimated procurement cost has since grown to $789.6
million--an increase of $355.2 million, or 81.8 percent. For more on
the TAGOS-25 program, see CRS In Focus IF11838, Navy TAGOS-25
(Previously TAGOS[X]) Ocean Surveillance Shipbuilding Program:
Background and Issues for Congress, by Ronald O'Rourke.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some of the cost growth shown above may be due to inflation
resulting from disruptions to supply chains related to the COVID-19
pandemic, some may be due to optimistic initial estimates of the
intrinsic costs for building these ships, and some may be due to other
causes. Cost growth in these Navy and Coast Guard shipbuilding programs
raises a question regarding the potential for a possibly comparable
amount of cost growth to occur in the PSC program due to inflation,
underestimation of intrinsic building costs, or other causes. If a
substantial degree of cost growth occurs in the PSC program, it could
raise a question regarding whether to grant some form of contract
relief to the PSC shipbuilder, as occurred in the OPC program.\25\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\25\ For more on the contract relief granted in the OPC program,
which was done under the authority provided by Pub. L. 85-804 (50
U.S.C. 1431-1435), see CRS Report R42567, Coast Guard Cutter
Procurement: Background and Issues for Congress, by Ronald O'Rourke.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
One option for Congress would be to ask the Congressional Budget
Office (CBO) to conduct a more-refined analysis of the potential for
cost growth in the PSC program. Something similar occurred with the
Navy's Constellation (FFG-62) class frigate program: A preliminary CRS
analysis suggested that if FFG-62s were to cost about the same to
construct per thousand tons of displacement as other recent U.S.
military surface combatants, then the third and subsequent FFG-62s
could cost 17 percent to 56 percent more than the budgeted estimates
for those ships in the Navy's fiscal year 2021 budget submission.
Following that preliminary CRS analysis, CBO was asked to conduct a
more-refined analysis, which estimated that the first 10 FFG-62s will
cost 40 percent more to build than the Navy estimates.\26\

Constellation (FFG-62) Class Frigate Program: Background and Issues for

Existing Commercially Available Polar Icebreaker (CAPI)
The Coast Guard's proposed fiscal year 2024 budget, in addition to
requesting continued procurement funding for the PSC program, also
requests $125.0 million in procurement funding for the purchase of an
existing commercially available polar icebreaker (CAPI) that would be
modified to become a Coast Guard polar icebreaker, so as to help
augment the Coast Guard's current polar icebreaking capacity until the
new PSCs enter service, and to continue augmenting the Coast Guard's
polar icebreaking capacity after the PSCs enter service. Under the
Coast Guard's proposal, the Coast Guard would conduct a full and open
competition for the purchase, the commercially-available icebreaker
that the Coast Guard selects for acquisition would be modified for
Coast Guard operations following its acquisition, and the ship would
enter service 18 to 24 months after being acquired. The total cost to
purchase the ship and then modify it to meet Coast Guard mission needs
is uncertain.
Prior to 2021, Coast Guard plans did not include the acquisition of
such a ship. The Coast Guard's fiscal year 2022 unfunded priorities
list (UPL), dated June 29, 2021, however, included a $150.0 million
item for the lease or purchase of a commercially-available vessel to
provide polar icebreaking capability until the future delivery of
PSCs.\28\ The following year, the Coast Guard as part of its proposed
fiscal year 2023 budget requested $125.0 million in procurement funding
for the purchase of an existing commercially-available polar
icebreaker. Congress, in acting on the Coast Guard's proposed fiscal
year 2023 budget, denied the request. The Coast Guard is once again
requesting the $125.0 million as part of its proposed fiscal year 2024
budget.

Service Life Extension for Polar Star
The Coast Guard plans to extend the service life of Polar Star
until the delivery of at least the second PSC.\29\ The Coast Guard
estimated the cost of Polar Star's service life extension work at $75
million, a sum that was funded at a rate of $15 million per year for 5
years, with the final $15-million increment being provided in fiscal
year 2023.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\29\ In February 2020, for example, the Coast Guard testified that:

The Coast Guard also understands that we must maintain our existing
heavy and medium icebreaking capability while proceeding with
recapitalization . . . Maintenance of POLAR STAR will be critical to
sustaining this capability until the new PSCs are delivered. Robust
planning efforts for a service life extension project on POLAR STAR are
already under way and initial work for this project will begin in 2020,
with phased industrial work occurring annually from 2021 through 2023.
The end goal of this process will be to extend the vessel's service
life until delivery of at least the second new PSC.

search and rescue (sar)
Increasing sea and air traffic through Arctic waters has increased
concerns regarding Arctic-area search-and-rescue (SAR) capabilities.
Given the location of current U.S. Coast Guard operating bases, it
could take Coast Guard aircraft several hours, and Coast Guard cutters
days or even weeks, to reach a ship in distress or a downed aircraft in
Arctic waters. The Coast Guard states that ``the closest Coast Guard
Air Station to the Arctic is located in Kodiak, AK, approximately 820
nautical miles south of Utqiagvik, AK, which is nearly the same
distance as from Boston, MA, to Miami, FL.''\30\ In addition to such
long distances, the harsh climate complicates SAR operations in the
region.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\30\ Coast Guard, Arctic Strategic Outlook, April 2019, p. 11.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Particular concern has been expressed about cruise ships carrying
large numbers of civilian passengers that may experience problems and
need assistance. There have been incidents of this kind with cruise
ships in waters off Antarctica, and a Russian-flagged passenger ship
with 162 people on board ran aground on Canada's Northwest Passage on
August 24, 2018.\31\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Coast Guard is participating in exercises focused on improving
Arctic SAR capabilities. Further increasing U.S. Coast Guard SAR
capabilities for the Arctic could require one or more of the following:
enhancing or creating new Coast Guard operating bases in the region;
procuring additional Arctic-capable aircraft, cutters, and rescue boats
for the Coast Guard; and adding systems to improve Arctic maritime
communications, navigation, and domain awareness. It may also entail
enhanced forms of cooperation with navies and coast guards of other
Arctic countries.
On May 12, 2011, representatives from the member states of the
Arctic Council, meeting in Nuuk, Greenland, signed an agreement on
cooperation on aeronautical and maritime SAR in the Arctic.\32\ The
agreement divides the Arctic into SAR areas within which each party has
primary responsibility for conducting SAR operations. Figure 2 shows a
map of the national areas of SAR responsibility based on the geographic
coordinates listed in the Annex to the agreement.

u.s. arctic strategic seaport
Some observers have expressed concern about whether the United
States is doing enough militarily to defend its interests in the
Arctic, and in some cases have offered recommendations for doing more,
such as building ice-hardened Navy or Coast Guard surface ships other
than icebreakers, or establishing a strategic seaport in Alaska's north
to better support DOD and Coast Guard operations in the Arctic.
(Anchorage, in the southern part of Alaska's mainland, was designated a
U.S. strategic seaport for supporting DOD operations in 2004.) A June
2023 press report stated that a $600 million project to expand port
facilities at Nome, Alaska, will make Nome ``the nation's first deep-
water Arctic port. The expansion, expected to be operational by the end
of the decade, will accommodate not just larger cruise ships of up to
4,000 passengers, but cargo ships to deliver additional goods for the
60 Alaska Native villages in the region, and military vessels to
counter the presence of Russian and Chinese ships in the Arctic.''\33\

conclusion
Chairman Gimenez, Ranking Member Thanedar, thank you again for the
opportunity to appear before you today, and I will be pleased to
respond to any questions the subcommittee may have.

Chairman Gimenez. Thank you, Mr. O'Rourke.
I recognize Mr. Coffey for 5 minutes to summarize his
opening statements.

STATEMENT OF LUKE COFFEY, SENIOR FELLOW, HUDSON INSTITUTE

Mr. Coffey. Chairman Gimenez, Ranking Member Thanedar, and
distinguished Members of the subcommittee, I am honored to
speak before the subcommittee on strategic competition in the
Arctic.
With your permission, Mr. Chairman, I will summarize my
prepared statement that has been submitted for the record.
The United States became an Arctic power on October 18,
1867, at a ceremony transferring the control of Alaska to the
United States. With the stroke of a pen, Secretary of State
William Seward ended Russian influence on North America. In his
retirement, Seward was asked what his greatest achievement was.
He replied, ``The purchase of Alaska. It'll take another
generation to find it out.'' I think it's safe to say that it's
probably taken more than a generation to figure that one out.
In the context of strategic competition, the United States
has four primary interests in the Arctic. First, ensuring the
territorial defense of the United States. This is what makes
our relationship with Canada so important. It also makes
Greenland and Iceland the foreign operating bases of the North
American continent.
Second, enforcing U.S. sovereignty in the region. In the
Arctic sovereignty equals security and stability. Respecting
other sovereignty while maintaining the ability to enforce
one's own sovereignty will ensure that the chances of armed
conflict in the region remains low. This is why the Coast Guard
has such an important role to play.
Third, meeting America's treaty obligations in the Arctic
through NATO.
Finally, ensuring the free flow of shipping and other
economic activities in the region in line with international
law and norms.
In terms of strategic competition, the United States faces
two competitors in the Arctic: Russia and China. Going back to
Peter the Great's two Kamchatka expeditions, the Arctic region
has always held a special place in the minds and the identity
of the Russian people. Therefore, focus on the Arctic serves as
a low-risk and useful distraction for Russia's other
geopolitical shortcomings like we've seen in Ukraine.
President Putin is acutely aware of the economic potential
of the region. It is estimated that Russia's Arctic region
already accounts for 20 percent of the country's GDP and could
grow in the future.
Russia also sees the region as vital to its security. Up
until Russia's large-scale invasion of Ukraine last year, it
invested heavily in militarizing its Arctic region.
In the simplest terms, China sees the Arctic region as
another place in the world where it can expand its diplomatic
and economic influence and interests. China's 2018 Arctic
strategy offers a useful glimpse in how Beijing views its role
in the region. Running 5,500 words in its English language
translated version, the strategy's littered with all of the
Arctic buzzwords that we in the West just love to hear, like
``common interests for all countries,'' ``law-based
governance,'' ``climate change,'' and ``sustainable
development''.
The irony, though, is not lost on observers of the South
China Sea, where China has shunned international norms to exert
dubious claims of sovereignty or by the fact that China is the
world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases.
Even though China's closest point to the Arctic Circle is
more than 800 miles away, Beijing refers to itself as a near-
Arctic state, a term that is completely made up. In fact,
extending Beijing's logic to other countries would mean that
Kazakhstan, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland,
Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Ireland are
also near-Arctic states. These are hardly countries one thinks
of when we think of the Arctic.
Mr. Chairman, there's been many unintended consequences
resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the Arctic is
no exception. When it comes to strategic competition, there are
five areas that have been impacted.
The first is the Arctic Council. Since Russia's invasion of
Ukraine, the Arctic Council has all but ceased from
functioning.
Second, there are new opportunities for China in the
Arctic. As Western sanctions begin to bite Russia, there are
new opportunities for Chinese firms to fill in the gap. But on
the other hand, as an observer of the Arctic Council, and with
the Arctic Council not functioning, China loses its voice in
that international organization.
Third is Russia's ambitions for the Northern Sea Route.
These are being curtailed by international sanctions. Last
year, not a single foreign cargo ship used the route, not even
one from China. Not a single ship transited the full route from
Asia to Europe.
Fourth, Russia's aggression has convinced Arctic states
Finland and Sweden to abandon decades-old policies of military
nonalignment to join NATO.
Finally, there's been an impact on Russia's overall
conventional military capability in the Arctic. Open-source
intelligence reporting tells us that Russia has suffered severe
consequences and losses in terms of personnel and equipment in
Ukraine by Russian units based in the Arctic.
In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, the United States needs to
champion an agenda that advances our national interests and
devotes the required resources to the region. America's
interests in the Arctic will only increase in the years to
come. As other nations devote resources and assets to the
region to secure their interests, America cannot afford to fall
behind. Thank you.

Prepared Statement of Luke Coffey
July 18, 2023
Chairman Gimenez, Ranking Member Thanedar, and distinguished
Members of the committee. I am honored to speak before this esteemed
committee about strategic competition in the Arctic.
My name is Luke Coffey. I am a senior fellow at Hudson Institute.
The views I express in this testimony are my own and should not be
construed as representing any official position of Hudson Institute.
The Arctic region, commonly referred to as the High North, is
becoming more contested than ever before. The Arctic encompasses the
lands and territorial waters of 8 countries on 3 continents. Unlike the
Antarctic, the Arctic has no land mass covering its pole (the North
Pole), just ocean. The region is home to some of the roughest terrain
and harshest weather on the planet.
The region is also one of the least populated areas in the world,
with sparse nomadic communities and a few large cities and towns.
Regions are often very remote and lack basic transport infrastructure.
In Greenland, no two population centers are connected by a road.
Norway's Ny Alesund, located on the Svalbard archipelago, is the
world's most northerly permanently-inhabited place with a population of
only 40. Although official population figures are non-existent, the
Arctic Council estimates the figure is ``almost four million'',\1\
making the Arctic's global population about the size of Los Angeles.
Approximately half of the Arctic population lives in Russia.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

council.org/explore/topics/arctic-peoples/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The region is rich in minerals, wildlife, fish, and other natural
resources. Although exact figures difficult to know, in 2008 the U.S.
Geological Survey estimated that up to 13 percent of the world's
undiscovered oil reserves and almost one-third of the world's
undiscovered natural gas reserves are located in the Arctic.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ The USGS has not updated its estimate since 2008 and these
figures remain the most widely quoted. See: U.S. Geological Survey,
``Circum-Arctic Resource Appraisal: Estimates of Undiscovered Oil and
Gas North of the Arctic Circle,'' July 23, 2008, http://pubs.usgs.gov/
fs/2008/3049.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The melting of some Arctic ice during the summer months creates
security challenges, but also new opportunities for economic
development. Reduced ice will mean new shipping lanes opening,
increased tourism, and further natural resource exploration. However,
it will also mean a larger military presence with more actors than ever
before. This is not because there is a heightened threat of conflict in
the region. Instead, it is because many capabilities needed in the
Arctic, such as search and rescue, are more immediately, and at least
for now, more effectively, provided by the military and coast guard.
Operating in the Arctic is no easy task for the military or coast
guard. Equipment must be hardened for extreme cold weather. High-
frequency radio signals can be degraded due to magnetic and solar
phenomena. GPS can be degraded due to poor satellite geometry. The
United States has no deep-water port above the Arctic Circle. The first
deep-water port planned for Nome, Alaska will not be completed until
2030--and that is if the project remains on schedule. Some of Alaska's
shipping lanes have not been surveyed properly since Captain James Cook
sailed through in 1778. All of this is complicated by underinvestment
in the U.S. Coast Guard in recent years.
u.s. arctic security interests
The United States became an Arctic power on October 18, 1867, at
the ceremony transferring Alaska from Russia to the United States. At
the time this purchase was ridiculed and was known as ``Seward's
Folly''--named after the then-Secretary of State William Seward.
However, with a stroke of a pen, Seward ended Russian influence in
North America, gave the United States direct access to the northern
Pacific Ocean, and added territory nearly twice the size of Texas for
about 2 cents an acre along with 33,000 miles of new coastline. In his
retirement Seward was asked what his greatest achievement was. He said:
``The purchase of Alaska. But it will take another generation to find
it out.''\3\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the context of strategic competition, the United States has four
primary geo-political interests in the Arctic region:
(1) Ensuring the territorial defense of the United States.--This is
particularly true as it pertains to the growing ballistic
missile threat. In this regard our relationship with Canada is
key. This is also why it is important for the United States to
deepen its relations with Iceland and Greenland--both serving
essentially the forward operating bases of the North American
continent.
(2) Enforcing U.S. sovereignty in the region.--In the Arctic,
sovereignty equals security and stability. Respecting the
national sovereignty of others in the Arctic while maintaining
the ability to enforce one's own sovereignty will ensure that
the chances of armed conflict in the region remains low. This
is why investment in the U.S. Coast Guard is vital to America's
Arctic interest.
(3) Meeting treaty obligations in the Arctic region through the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).--Six of the world's
8 Arctic countries belong to NATO. Later this year, this will
increase to 7 after Sweden joins. However, NATO has no agreed
common position or policy on its role in the Arctic region.
This needs to change.
(4) Ensuring the free flow of shipping and other economic
activities in the region.--Economic freedom leads to prosperity
and security. With melting ice creating new economic and
shipping opportunities in the region it is in America's
interests that shipping lanes remain open in line with
international norms.
u.s. strategic challenges in the arctic
While the military threat in the Arctic remains low, U.S. policy
makers cannot ignore Russia's recent activities to militarize the
Arctic region or China's increasing diplomatic and economic role in the
region. Both directly impact America's ability to meet the 4
aforementioned geo-political interests.
Russia's Militarization
Russia is motivated to play an active role in the Arctic region for
three reasons:
(1) Low-risk promotion of Russian nationalism.--Going back to Peter
the Great's two Kamchatka Expeditions, the Arctic region has
held a special place in hearts and identities of the Russian
people. With nationalism on the rise in Russia, President
Putin's Arctic strategy is popular among the population. Focus
on the Arctic can also serve as a useful distraction for
Russia's other geo-political shortcomings, like in Ukraine. For
President Putin, the Arctic is an area that allows Russia to
flex its muscles without incurring any significant geopolitical
risk.
(2) The economic potential of the region.--Russia is also eager to
promote its economic interests in the region. Half of the
world's Arctic territory and half of the Arctic region's
population is located in Russia. It is well-known that the
Arctic is home to large stockpiles of proven, yet unexploited,
oil and gas reserves. The majority of these reserves is thought
to be located in Russia. In particular, Russia hopes the
Northern Sea Route (NSR) will become one of the world's most
important shipping lanes.
(3) Russia's security in the region.--Up until Russia's large-scale
invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, it invested heavily in
militarizing its Arctic region. In the past 15 years more than
20 military installations above the Arctic Circle have been
established or re-opened after being closed in the 1990's.
NATO's most recent Strategic Concept dated 2022 stated: ``In
the High North, its [Russia's] capability to disrupt Allied
reinforcements and freedom of navigation across the North
Atlantic is a strategic challenge to the Alliance.''\4\
According to the 2023 NATO Summit communique: ``Russia . . .
maintains significant military capabilities in the Arctic.''\5\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
China's Increasing Role
With the focus on what China is doing in the South China Sea, its
massive and questionable infrastructure investments in Africa, its
threatening actions against Taiwan, and its cover-up of the origins of
the COVID-19 virus, it is easy to overlook another aspect of Beijing's
foreign policy: the Arctic.
In the simplest terms, China sees the Arctic region as another
place in the world to advance its economic interests and expand its
diplomatic influence. As a non-Arctic country, China is mindful that
its Arctic ambitions in international Arctic institutions are naturally
limited--but this has not stopped Beijing from increasing its economic
presence in the region.
China's 2018 Arctic strategy offers a useful glimpse into how
Beijing views its role in the region.\6\ Running 5,500 words long in
the English language version, the strategy is littered with all the
Arctic buzzwords like ``common interests of all countries,'' ``law-
based governance,'' ``climate change,'' and ``sustainable
development.'' The irony is not lost on observers of the South China
Sea where China has shunned international norms to exert dubious claims
of sovereignty, or the fact that China is the world's largest emitter
of greenhouse gases.

content_281476026660336.htm.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Even though China's closest point to the Arctic Circle is more than
800 miles away, Beijing refers to itself as a ``near-Arctic
state''\7\--a term made up by Beijing and not found in the lexicon of
Arctic discourse. In fact, extending Beijing's logic to other countries
would mean that Belarus, Estonia, Germany, Ireland, Kazakhstan, Latvia,
Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, and the United Kingdom are also
``near-Arctic states.'' These are hardly the countries that one
imagines when thinking about the Arctic. As my Hudson Institute
colleague and former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said:
``There are Arctic states, and non-Arctic states. No third category
exists. China claiming otherwise entitles them to exactly nothing.''\8\

audience-tongue-lashing-china-russia-eve-arctic-council-ministerial.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
China is motivated be an Arctic actor for five primary reasons:
(1) New Shipping Routes.--China is unique in modern times in being
a continental power that is almost entirely dependent on the
sea for food and energy.\9\ New sea-lanes in the Arctic have
the potential to play an important role when it comes to
diversifying China's import dependencies.

the-importance-maritime-domain-awareness-the-indo-pacific-quad-
countries.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Economic Influence.--China sees itself as a global power, and
the Arctic is just another region in which to engage. China
hopes to complement its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)--a vast
trading network being constructed by China on the Eurasian
landmass and beyond--by investing in and constructing major
infrastructure projects along the emerging sea-lanes in the
Arctic.
(3) Scientific Research.--Whether it is for China's sea-based
nuclear deterrent, natural resource extraction, or commercial
shipping, research on polar high-altitude atmospheric physics,
glacial oceans, bioecology, and meteorological geology,
scientific research in the Arctic is important for China's
strategic interests. As a signatory of the 1920 Svalbard
Treaty, China is allowed to conduct scientific research on
Norway's Svalbard archipelago and has done so since 2004 at its
Arctic Yellow River Station located in Ny Alesund.
(4) Laying the Groundwork for Future Military Activity in the
Region.--Currently, China's military involvement in the Arctic
is limited. According to open-source reporting, the U.S. Coast
Guard has spotted the People's Liberation Army Navy in
international waters off the coast of Alaska in recent years.
However, there is no publicly-available evidence that the PLA
Navy has never sailed into waters above the Arctic Circle. The
Pentagon has warned ``that China could use its civilian
research presence in the Arctic to strengthen its military
presence, including by deploying submarines to the region as a
deterrent against nuclear attacks.''\10\

www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-military-arctic/pentagon-warns-on-
risk-of-chinese-submarines-in-arctic-idUSKCN1S829H.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
(5) Access to Minerals, Fishing, and Other Natural Resources.--
China also sees the Arctic region as a way to satisfy its
growing demands for energy and food. China is a significant
investor in Russian natural gas projects. There are on-going
talks between Moscow and Beijing for the construction of the
Power of Siberia 2 natural gas pipeline to complement the
existing Power of Siberia line. The dietary needs of China's
population can be met partly by increased fishing in the Arctic
region.
a role for nato?
The U.S. ability to meet national security objectives in the Arctic
is made possible (and easier) by the close collaboration with partner
nations in the region. Luckily for the United States, 6 of the other 7
Arctic countries are either treaty allies through NATO (Canada,
Denmark, Finland, Iceland, and Norway) or, in the case of Sweden, will
soon be in NATO.
Considering that most of the world's Arctic countries are in NATO,
one would expect that the Alliance would place a strong focus on the
region. This has not been the case. While there are training exercises
that take partially take place in Norway's Arctic region, NATO has no
agreed common position or policy on its role in the Arctic region.
Until recently, no official document from NATO even contained the word
``Arctic''. This began to change in 2022 when NATO's Strategic Concept
published that summer mentioned the ``High North''--a first for the
Alliance. The recent communique from the 2023 Vilnius Summit makes one
brief mention of the Arctic--the first time the Arctic was mentioned in
a summit communique in recent memory.
NATO has been internally divided on the role that the Alliance
should play in the Arctic. Norway has traditionally been the leading
voice inside the Alliance for promoting NATO's role in the Arctic. It
is the only country in the world that has its permanent military
headquarters above the Arctic Circle, and it has invested extensively
in Arctic defense capabilities.
Canada has likewise invested heavily in Arctic defense
capabilities. However, unlike Norway, Canada has stymied past efforts
by NATO to take on a larger role in the region. Generally speaking,
Canada is concerned that an Alliance role in the Arctic would afford
non-Arctic NATO countries influence in an area where they otherwise
would have none. As a sovereign nation-state, Canada has a prerogative
to determine what role, if any, NATO should play in Canada's Arctic
region. However, as a collective security alliance, NATO cannot ignore
the Arctic altogether, and the Alliance should not remain divided on
the issue. With Sweden's pending membership, this will mean that 7 out
of the 8 Arctic powers will be part of the same security alliance. From
a practical point of view, NATO now has no choice but to develop and
implement a policy in the region. This probably explains why recent
official NATO documents are starting to mention the region explicitly.
russia's invasion of ukraine impacting the arctic
There have been many unintended consequences resulting from
Russia's large-scale invasion of Ukraine last year. For example, the
war has threatened Ukraine's global grain exports leaving some
countries in Africa and the Middle East with the threat of food
insecurity. Russia is now reliant on Iran for weapons imports--
something unimaginable before the war. Global energy markets have been
impacted because of the war too. However, one area that has been
affected by the war but doesn't get much attention is the Arctic
region. There are four areas that have been impacted:
(1) The functioning of the Arctic Council.--The Arctic Council was
founded in 1994 by the 8 Arctic states (Canada, Denmark,
Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United
States) to cooperate in the region on non-military related
issues. Over the years, cooperation has taken place on search-
and-rescue operations, oil spill cleanup, and other
environmental issues.
Even after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, cooperation
continued inside the council. But since Russia's invasion of
Ukraine last year the Arctic Council has stopped functioning.
No meetings take place and day-to-day operations have stopped.
In May, Russia's 2-year-long chairmanship of the Arctic Council
transferred to Norway. Normally, there's a big summit and a lot
of diplomatic fanfare when a transfer takes place. Not this
time. Instead, Russia handed over the chair of the Arctic
Council to Norway during a low-key virtual meeting.
(2) New opportunities for China in the Arctic.--The impact of the
war in Ukraine on China's Arctic ambitions are two-fold. On one
hand, Western economic sanctions have created new opportunities
for Chinese firms. No doubt China will try stepping in to help
Russia. This will mean more cooperation between Moscow and
Beijing in the Arctic region. For example, in April, Russia and
China signed an agreement to increase coast guard cooperation
in the Arctic.\11\ There is also a lot of ambition regarding
energy cooperation between the two.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\11\ Thomas Nilsen, ``Russia's Coast Guard cooperation with China
is a big step, Arctic security expert says,'' The Barents Observer,
April 28, 2023, https://thebarentsobserver.com/en/security/2023/04/
russias-arctic-coast-guard-cooperation-china-big-step-expert.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the other hand, with the Arctic Council no longer functioning,
Beijing has lost one of its most important tools for influence
in the Arctic. Since 2013, China has been an observer member of
the Arctic Council and it uses this position to fund research
projects and exert influence in the Arctic region. Until the
Arctic Council resumes normal operations, China will have to
find other ways to play an active diplomatic role in the
region.
(3) Russia's ambitious plans for its Northern Sea Route are being
curtailed.--The Northern Sea Route runs from the Barents Sea to
the Bering Strait along the northern coast of Russia connecting
European with Asian markets. There are some who suggest that
the route could become a viable alternative--even a rival--to
the Suez Canal because it cuts transit time and distance from
Europe to East Asia considerably.
In some cases, this is true. Using Northern Sea Route certainly
makes a trip between northern European ports to northern Asian
ports considerably shorter than using the Suez Canal route. It
must be pointed out that this is not the case for southern
European ports like Genoa, Trieste, or Barcelona.
The Northern Sea Route is far from competing with the Suez Canal.
In 2021, the year before Russia's large-scale invasion of
Ukraine and the implementation of Western economic sanctions,
only 35 million tons of goods transited along that route. Of
this, only 2.75 million tons made the full journey between
Europe to Asia.\12\ This is .02 percent of the volume of goods
that transited through the Suez Canal during the same year.
During this period 86 ships transited the full Northern Sea
Route between Europe and Asia--equal to the number of ships
that pass through the Suez Canal every 36 hours.

35m Tons, Record Number of Transits,'' High North News, January 26,
2022, https://www.highnorthnews.com/en/cargo-volume-northern-sea-route-
reaches-35m-tons-record-number-transits.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
International sanctions against Russia have discouraged the use of
the route even more. Last year, not a single foreign ship used
the route to transport cargo--not even from China.\13\ Only 34
million tons of goods were shipped using the route and there
were no full transits linking Europe with Asia.\14\ Even with
the Russian government continuing to invest in the Northern Sea
Route, the possibility of it replacing Suez, or even
drastically increasing the volume of trade transported along
the route, seems remote.

lots-russian-traffic-no-international-transits-2022.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) An impact on Russia's overall military readiness in the
Arctic.--While Russia has not let the war against Ukraine stop
it from investing and its nuclear weapons modernization program
and infrastructure projects above the Arctic Circle, the
invasion has taken a toll on Russia's conventional armed forces
based in the Arctic region.
A good example of this is the 200th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade
stationed in Pechenga only miles for the border with Norway in
the Russian Arctic. This unit, specially trained and equipped
to fight in Arctic conditions, participated in the initial
large-scale invasion of Ukraine last year. According to media
reports, of the initial 1,400 troops it entered Ukraine with
only 900 survived.\15\ The loss of Russian armored vehicles,
main battle tanks, and other associated military hardware is
well-documented through open-source intelligence gathering.
Undoubtedly, this loss of equipment and personnel in Ukraine
will impact Russia's conventional military readiness in the
Arctic is ways not yet completely understood. With the main
focus of Russia's conventional armed forces being on the war in
Ukraine there is less focus and fewer resources available for
Russia's military in the Arctic region.

recommendations
Russia is reverting to its imperial ways, and China is expanding
its economic influence across much of the world. As new economic
opportunities and security challenges continue to manifest in the
Arctic, the United States must be prepared. The United States should:

Continue to invest in the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Navy
Arctic situational awareness capabilities.--The remote and
harsh conditions of the Arctic region make unmanned systems
particularly appealing for providing additional situational
awareness, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance.

Conduct Freedom of Navigation operations in the Arctic.--
Russia's dubious claim that the Northern Sea Route is an
internal waterway goes against international law and norms. The
United States should follow the lead of the French navy and
conduct Freedom of Navigation operations in the region in a way
that is in line with U.S. national interest and in accordance
with international law and norms.

Work with allies to develop a NATO Arctic strategy.--The
Alliance should agree to develop a comprehensive Arctic policy
to address security challenges in the region. This is
particularly important considering the entry of Finland and
Sweden into the Alliance.

Call for a NATO summit to be held above the Arctic Circle.--
This would bring immediate awareness of Arctic issues to the
Alliance. Perhaps the Norwegian city of Troms would be most
appropriate, since few cities above the Arctic Circle have the
required infrastructure to hold a major international gathering
like a NATO Summit.

Continue to raise awareness of China's questionable
ambitions.--China has declared itself a ``near-Arctic state''--
a made-up term that previously did not exist in Arctic
discourse. The United States should work with like-minded
partners in the Arctic to raise legitimate concerns about
China's ambitions in the region. So far, China's motivation in
the Arctic seems to be more about economics and less about
security but considering China's predatory economic behavior in
places like Africa, it is only reasonable to question China's
motivations in the Arctic.

Deepen relations with Iceland.--Not only is Iceland an
important NATO member, but it is also home to a very important
air base in the Arctic region. The Trump administration ended
the diplomatic sanctions that applied to Reykjavik by the Obama
administration over Icelandic whaling. The Biden administration
should continue to improve U.S.-Icelandic relations.

Deepen relations with Greenland.--Greenland is an autonomous
constituent country of the Kingdom of Denmark. Greenland has
competency over most policy areas, with the big exceptions
being foreign affairs, defense, and monetary policy--all of
which are still controlled by Copenhagen. The United States has
operated an important military base in Greenland since 1943. In
2020, the United States re-established a diplomatic presence in
the capital Nuuk--the first such presence on the island since
1953. The United States should ensure that it invests
adequately in the military infrastructure in Greenland and
deepen relations with Nuuk.

Consider establishing a U.S. diplomatic presence in the
Faroe Islands.--The Faroe Islands is an autonomous constituent
country of the Kingdom of Denmark located in the north Atlantic
about halfway between the United Kingdom and Iceland. Like
Greenland, the Faroe Islands has competency over most policy
areas, with the big exceptions being foreign affairs, defense,
and monetary policy--all of which are still controlled by
Copenhagen. While the United States does not maintain a
military base in the Faroe Islands, the country's geopolitical
significance is increasing. For example, in June, a nuclear-
powered U.S. submarine (the USS Delaware) visited the islands
for a port call--the first such visit by the U.S. Navy in the
Faroe Islands. With a population comparable to Greenland's, and
with growing geo-political importance, the United States should
consider establishing a diplomatic presence in the Faroe
Islands too.

Consider the use of Svalbard for any required scientific
needs under the terms of the 1920 Svalbard Treaty.--Due to its
location in the Arctic region and its particular environmental
conditions, Svalbard is very attractive for scientific
research. In the past, the Department of Defense has conducted
research there and it should consider doing so in the future if
the need arises. This is an excellent way for the United States
to ``fly the flag'' in a region with significant geo-political
importance.

Preparing for the future of the Arctic Council and
multilateral cooperation in the Arctic.--It is inconceivable
that the Arctic Council in its current form will function in
any meaningful way as long as Russia continues its aggression
against Ukraine. The 7 other Arctic states need to start
thinking about alternative structures and new ways of
cooperating in the Arctic region. The goal would not be to
replace the Arctic Council but instead to ensure that a
framework is created allowing important work to continue
without Russia. The United States should lead this effort.
conclusion
America's interests in the Arctic region will only increase in the
years to come. As other nations devote resources and assets in the
region to secure their national interests, America cannot afford to
fall behind. The United States needs to champion an agenda that
advances the U.S. national interest and devotes the required national
resources to the region. With the Arctic becoming increasingly
important in an era of strategic competition, now is not the time for
the United States to turn away from its own backyard.

Ms. Brimmer. Thank you, Chairman Gimenez and the Ranking
Member Thanedar and the distinguished Members of the
subcommittee for inviting me to testify today about strategic
competition in the Arctic.
With your permission, I will summarize my remarks that have
been submitted for the record.
The Arctic stands at the confluence of three phenomena:
shifting geopolitics, climate change, and the far-reaching
implications of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The Arctic is geographical, but is also conceptual. Just as
the words ``Indo-Pacific'' or the ``South China Sea'' connotes
strategic concepts, so too the Arctic takes on renewed
strategic importance. The Arctic is America's fourth coast,
meaning increased attention needs to be paid to the
interlocking strategic, economic, environmental, and social
concerns in the region.
I will begin by commenting on the geopolitics and the
changing institutions in the Arctic. As we've already noted in
this hearing, the geopolitics of the Arctic was dramatically
altered by the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Both
Finland and Sweden abandoned in Sweden's case 200 years of
neutrality to join America's most important in military
alliance and we hope they'll be members soon.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine not only enhanced NATO, it
also inadvertently stalled competition in one of the Arctic's
most distinctive multilateral organizations, the Arctic
Council. Founded in 1996 in the afterglow of the end of the
Cold War, the Arctic Council embodied the spirit of
cooperation. Decisions were made by consensus and the forum
focused on sustainable development and environmental issues. By
design, it did not focus on security.
Unusual for an intergovernmental body, the Arctic Council
also includes 6 permanent participant organizations
representing Arctic indigenous peoples. This special facility
for interaction is distinctive and should be preserved.
Cultural ties span current national borders.
At the time of the 2022 invasion of Ukraine by Russia,
unfortunately Russia happened to be holding the chair of the
Arctic Council. Obviously the other 7 paused relationships with
the Arctic Council. Norway is now chair and seeks to revitalize
cooperation in this body.
This strategic realignment in the Arctic builds on
political shifts that were already evident before the invasion.
Recent years witnessed the resurgence of great power
competition. The United States faces a rising power, China, and
the Russian Federation. Increasingly, countries outside the
Arctic have been active in the region. The one of greatest
concern, of course, is China. But that said, there are numerous
observers at the Arctic Council, including Japan, India, Italy,
the Republic of Korea, and Singapore, although they just joined
in 2013 a longer list of members of the observer group at the
Arctic Council.
But even before the war in Ukraine, Russia needed partners
for economic development. Indeed, the--Russia's need for
economic partners creates and opening for China. China invested
$90 billion in energy resources and most of those projects are
in Russia.
An increased activity by China and Russia in the Arctic is
a manifestation of another trend: great power competition in
global spaces. In many parts of the world, great powers and
assertive middle powers seek access to resources. Access to
areas beyond or at the edge of national jurisdiction is crucial
for success in this era of strategic and commercial rivalry.
Therefore, the protection of coastlines, waterways, safe
commercial transit, and management of marine resources is
increasingly important, placing greater demands on the Coast
Guard.
Fundamental to understanding the geopolitical and economic
issues in the Arctic is the phenomenon of climate change.
Global warming is occurring quickly in the Arctic. Climate
change is important to the geopolitics of the Arctic because it
changes access to oceans. Climate change also changes
livelihoods. Around 60 percent of Alaska Natives are challenged
by climate change.
In conclusion, to advance maritime security in an era of
strategic competition in the Arctic, the United States must
continue to deepen its commitment to make progress on building
a deepwater port in Nome, Alaska, continue the Polar Security
Cutter program, and work with the current chair of the Arctic
Council of Norway to sustain mechanisms that are value to
Americans who live in Alaska.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Prepared Statement of Esther D. Brimmer
July 18, 2023
Thank you, Chairman Gimenez, Ranking Member Thanedar, and Members
of the subcommittee, for inviting me to testify today about ``Strategic
Competition in the Arctic.''
The Arctic sits at the confluence of three phenomena: shifting
geopolitics, changing climate, and the far-ranging implications of
Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Arctic is geographical, the home of
almost 4 million people facing the impact of climate change that will
alter lives and livelihoods.\1\ It is also conceptual. Just as the
words ``Indo-Pacific'' or the ``South China Sea'' connote strategic
concepts, so too the ``Arctic'' takes on renewed strategic meaning. The
Arctic is ``America's Fourth Coast'' meriting increased attention to
the interlocking strategic, economic, environmental, and social
concerns in this region.\2\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Arctic Circle begins at 66.5N (north of the equator). Eight
countries have territory in the Arctic Circle: Canada, Finland,
Denmark, Iceland, Norway, the Russian Federation, Sweden, and the
United States. The end of the Cold War reduced political pressures in
the Arctic region. The spirit of the Norwegian concept, ``High North,
Low Tension'' prevailed. The strategic situation has mutated into a new
configuration. By 2023, renewed great power competition around the
world is manifest in the Arctic region.
The Arctic intensifies the effects of decisions made elsewhere. The
geopolitics of the Arctic were dramatically altered by the Russian
Federation's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Russia's invasion of Ukraine
fundamentally transformed the security calculations of two longtime-
neutral countries. As a result of Russia's actions, Nordic states
Finland and Sweden applied for membership in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO). Finland had been neutral since 1948 and Sweden had
been neutral since the Napoleonic era two centuries ago. Both abandoned
neutrality to seek the security of the world's most powerful military
alliance.
This expansion recalibrates politics within NATO. With the
accession of Finland, 6 (and with Sweden 7) of the Arctic countries are
formal allies. Finland was admitted in April 2023, bringing NATO an
832-mile land border with Russia. The upshot for the Arctic is that the
region transmutes from a region with 5 NATO allies, 2 strategically
neutral states, and the Russian Federation to a zone with potentially 7
NATO allies and the Russian Federation.
NATO is a defensive military alliance, but it is also a framework
for deep cooperation among the national security communities of the
member states. Henceforth, the Arctic will play a larger role in the
strategic operations, calculations, and exercises of America's most
important military alliance. The North Atlantic and Arctic would be
important for North American supplies flowing to European allies in a
crisis. The institutions of the alliance will increasingly embed Arctic
and High North topics into their work. For example, Allied Command
Transformation states, `` . . . the High North is an important priority
for NATO'' when explaining the addition of Arctic activities to its
projects preparing NATO members for future challenges.\3\ Presidential
time is valuable. The importance of the High North was exemplified by
President Joe Biden's trip to Helsinki for the United States-Nordic
Leaders' Summit after the July 11-13, 2023, NATO summit.\4\
Furthermore, Finland and Sweden are both members of the European Union,
making 2 more E.U. members also NATO members, which could alter E.U.
security discussions.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine not only enhanced NATO, it also
inadvertently stalled cooperation in one of the Arctic's most
distinctive multilateral organizations: the Arctic Council. Founded in
1996 in the afterglow following the end of the Cold War, the Arctic
Council embodies the spirit of cooperation; decisions are made by
consensus. The forum focuses on ``sustainable development and
environmental protection in the Arctic.''\5\ By design, the Arctic
Council does not address security issues. The Council has adopted 3
legally binding agreements: the Agreement on Cooperation on
Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue in the Arctic (2011), the
Agreement on Cooperation on Marine Oil Pollution Preparedness and
Response in the Arctic (2013), and the Agreement on Enhancing
International Arctic Scientific Cooperation (2017).\6\

Unusual for an intergovernmental body, the Arctic Council also
includes 6 Permanent Participants representing Arctic Indigenous
Peoples. This special facility for interaction is distinctive and
should be preserved. Cultural ties span current national borders.
Indigenous peoples have lived in the harsh climate of the Arctic for
over a thousand years; their expertise and perspectives can be relevant
as countries seek to understand climate change.
At the time of the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Russia happened to
hold the rotating chairmanship of the Arctic Council. As part of the
international response to the invasion, the other 7 members of the
Arctic Council paused cooperation with Russia in that body. Upon
assuming the 2-year chairmanship in May 2023, Norway sought to
revitalize cooperation in the Arctic Council articulating 4 priorities:
``the oceans; climate and environment; sustainable economic
development; and people in the north.''\7\ Another venue for
cooperation, the Arctic Coast Guard Forum remains dormant with Russia
holding the chairmanship through 2023.

This strategic realignment in the Arctic builds on political shifts
that were already evident before the invasion. Recent years witnessed a
resurgence of great power competition. The United States faces a rising
power, China, and the Russian Federation. Increasingly, countries
outside the Arctic have become more active in the region. China called
itself a ``near-Arctic'' state in its 2018 Arctic Policy White
Paper.\8\ In 2013, China, Japan, India, Italy, the Republic of Korea,
and Singapore became Arctic Council Observers, joining France, Germany,
The Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

Many countries and companies are interested in access to resources.
The Arctic is home to living and mineral resources. Managing access in
the fragile Arctic environment is challenging. Yet, agreements are
possible. Arctic countries share a concern about illegal, unreported,
and unregulated fishing that depletes delicate natural resources and
vulnerable wildlife. Canada, China, the Kingdom of Denmark (in respect
of the Faroe Islands and Greenland), Iceland, Japan, the Republic of
Korea, Norway, the Russian Federation, the United States, and the
European Union are parties to the Agreement to Prevent Unregulated High
Seas Fisheries in the central Arctic Ocean, which entered into force in
2021 and initially will be in force until 2037. The agreement would be
automatically extended for another 5 years as long as none of the
Parties object.\9\

In 2008, the U.S. Geological Survey estimated that 13 percent, or
90 billion barrels, of the world's undiscovered conventional oil
resources were in the Arctic.\10\ Most of these resources are in Alaska
and the Russian Federation. The Arctic plays an important role in the
Russian economy. About half of the Arctic area is Russian coastline.
Twenty percent of Russia's land mass is in the Arctic Circle and
includes large cities. Russia wants others to use (and pay to use) the
Northern Sea Route.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Even before the war in Ukraine, Russia needed partners for economic
development. Economic sanctions promulgated as part of the
international response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine foreclose
options for Russia.
Russia's need for investment opens a gateway for China to be more
involved in Arctic issues. High North News notes that China has
invested $90 billion in energy and resource projects in the Arctic over
the past decade, largely in Russia.\11\ China is Russia's leading trade
partner, as China is for 120 countries.\12\ China's investments in the
Arctic are related to its Belt and Road Initiative. Yet, patterns of
Chinese shipping were different in 2022. High North News reports that
whereas China's COSCO shipping company had been the largest non-Russian
operator along the Northern Sea Route (NSR), it did not send any ships
along the NSR in 2022. In 2022, of the 314 ships sailing along the
Northern Sea Route, only 36 were non-Russian-flagged vessels.\13\
Nevertheless, Chinese investment in Russia continues to grow. Chinese-
Russian trade rose to a ``record $190 billion'' in 2022.\14\ There are
European countries that still have economic links with Russia. European
Union countries' consumption of Russian LNG increased 50 percent since
sanctions started, mostly going to Belgium, France, and Spain.\15\

Increased activity by China and Russia in the Arctic is a
manifestation of another trend: great power competition in global
spaces. For over a century the United States has enjoyed command of the
seas and more recently air space and outer space. Access to sea routes,
airwaves, cyber space, and satellite information are all necessary for
modern economies to function, but also require using shared
international spaces that may be beyond or at the edges of national
jurisdiction. In many parts of the world great power and assertive
middle powers seek access to resources, some of which may be in or
under these global spaces. Access to the global commons and areas
beyond national jurisdiction is crucial for success in an era of
strategic and commercial rivalry. Therefore, protection of coastlines,
waterways, safe commercial transit, and management of marine resources
place extra demands on the United States Coast Guard.
Oceans are especially sensitive. At the center of the Arctic region
is the Arctic Ocean, which is beyond the jurisdiction of any country.
The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea creates the
international legal regime for oceans, including the Arctic Ocean. Each
Arctic country, including the United States, claims its 200-mile
exclusive economic zone. The United States is at a disadvantage because
it is not a party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the
Sea, which provides mechanisms for countries to claim more rights.
Canada, Russia, and Denmark (on behalf of Greenland) turned to one of
those mechanisms, the United Nations Commission on the Limit of the
Continental Shelf (CLCS) regarding their overlapping claims to the
Lomonosov Ridge under the Arctic Ocean. The CLCS made non-binding
recommendations in February 2023 about the extent of Russia's claim.
Further diplomatic or legal work will need to occur to settle the
borders.\16\

The Arctic, like other regions of the world, benefits from layers
of global governance. Even in an era of geopolitical upheaval,
cooperation on technical standards facilitates commercial, social, and
environmental interactions. The International Maritime Organization's
International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters (Polar Code),
which entered into force in 2017, provides important standards for
shippers operating in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. The terms of
the Polar Code are mandatory under both the International Convention
for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) and the International Convention
for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL).\17\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fundamental to understanding the geopolitical and economic issues
in the Arctic is the phenomenon of climate change. Global warming is
occurring in the Arctic possibly 3 times as fast as in the rest of the
world.\18\ Sea ice is frozen seawater. With less Arctic sea ice to
reflect sunshine away from the Earth, the planet will continue to heat
up. Furthermore, the Greenland ice sheet (which is frozen freshwater)
has lost ice for the past 25 years.

faster than the whole planet, study finds,'' National Public Radio,

is-heating-up-nearly-four-times-faster-than-the-rest-of-earth-study-f.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The on-going geopolitical shifts occurring before the invasion of
Ukraine were premised on climate change. Climate change is important to
the geopolitics of the Arctic because it changes access to the oceans.
The warming climate means that more areas of the Arctic are ice-free in
the summer, possibly opening opportunities for navigation. There could
be ice-free summers in the Arctic Ocean in the 2030's. Companies and
countries watch to see if navigation through the Arctic would be
viable, thereby shortening shipping routes and times between Asia and
Europe. Other observers counter that even with less ice, Arctic
navigation would still be difficult.
Climate change challenges livelihoods. Around 4 million people live
in the Arctic, and about 2 million of them are Russian; about 500,000
are Indigenous people. Around 60 percent of Alaska Native communities
are ``environmentally threatened'' by climate change. Conditions are
especially acute for Indigenous people who still hunt for sustenance.
Thin ice and altered animal migrations mean hunters must travel farther
for food. Migration patterns of birds and fish, and also caribou,
walruses, and whales have shifted, requiring people to extend the
hunting season. Warmer waters may entice fish usually found in lower
latitudes to move farther north. The changing climate also affects
companies' calculations. Shell ended offshore exploration in Alaska in
2015.
The Biden administration's October 2022 National Strategy for the
Arctic Region includes investments in the Arctic. To advance maritime
security in an era of strategic competition in the Arctic, the United
States must continue to deepen its commitment to:

Make progress on building a deep-water port in Nome, Alaska.

Continue the Polar Security Cutter program.

Work with the current chair of the Arctic Council, Norway,
to sustain mechanisms that promote human and environmental
well-being, including connections among Indigenous Peoples in
the Arctic region.

Chairman Gimenez. Thank you, Dr. Brimmer.
Members will be recognized by order of seniority for their
5 minutes of questioning. I recognize myself for 5 minutes of
questioning.
Mr. O'Rourke, how important are these icebreakers to
protect America's interests in the Arctic?
Mr. O'Rourke. I think most people would say that they are
central to the Coast Guard's ability to perform its missions in
the Arctic. The Coast Guard would not be able to do most of its
statutory missions in the Arctic without them. They aren't the
only thing that the Coast Guard would need to perform its
missions, and I mentioned some of the other things, the
aircraft, possible UAVs, improved shore facilities and
communications, but the icebreakers are central to that. As I
mentioned in my opening statement, they can be considered a
form of mobile infrastructure. So, when we talk about improving
U.S. infrastructure in the Arctic, the icebreakers can be
considered to be part of that.
Chairman Gimenez. Well, how many icebreakers does the
United States operate up there in the Arctic?
Mr. O'Rourke. The U.S. operational polar icebreaker fleet
is currently two ships: the heavy icebreaker, Polar Star, and
medium polar icebreaker, Healy.
Chairman Gimenez. So, one medium and one heavy?
Mr. O'Rourke. That's right.
Chairman Gimenez. How many does Russia operate?
Mr. O'Rourke. They have about 36 government-operated
icebreakers, including 6 heavys, 22 mediums, and 8 lights.
Those are the government-operated ones. They also have private-
sector polar icebreakers, 9 medium and 6 light.
Chairman Gimenez. I would think that----
Mr. O'Rourke. If you add all those together, that's 51.
Chairman Gimenez. Fifty-one. But I would figure that they
have a much bigger footprint on the other side of the Arctic in
terms of the miles that they have on the Arctic. Is that
correct or am I incorrect?
Mr. O'Rourke. That's right. They----
Chairman Gimenez. But not to this level, right? Not this
difference?
Mr. O'Rourke. Russia has about one-half of the Arctic
coastline. They also have 2 million people living above the
Arctic Circle. They have many Arctic towns and communities.
They use portions of the Northern Sea Route that runs along the
Russian coast as a marine highway to connect those towns to one
another. So, they have quite a lot of people and economic
activity. That's reflected in their icebreaker fleet.
Chairman Gimenez. How many of those icebreakers kind-of
operate in our sphere of influence, in our area, of theirs?
Mr. O'Rourke. Well, their icebreakers operate primarily in
their own Arctic waters, although they will occasionally send
icebreakers into the central Arctic, for example, in support of
taking measurements for their extended continental shelf
claims.
Chairman Gimenez. How many icebreakers do the Chinese have?
Mr. O'Rourke. The Chinese currently have 2 polar
icebreakers, one that they purchased from Ukraine, if I
remember right, the second one was indigenously built. A third
one is currently under construction. The 2 that are operational
have already made numerous cruises to the Arctic. In fact, one
of them, the new one, the Xue Long, has just started its most
recent cruise into Arctic waters.
Chairman Gimenez. What do you think that the PRC's aims in
the Arctic are? What are they after?
Mr. O'Rourke. That is a subject of conversation and
curiosity and concern among numerous observers. Part of it is
economic. Some of it may relate to mining and fishing. Some of
it is geopolitical. Some of it may reflect their desire to be a
world power and their view that world powers need to be active
in the polar regions, including both the Arctic and the
Antarctic. The exact mix of China's motivations for its
activities in the Arctic and what their end goals may be are a
matter of discussion. Those may have shifted as a consequence
of Russia's war in Ukraine and the impact that has had on the
Arctic in terms of what Mr. Coffey mentioned, for example, and
providing more opportunity for China to cooperate with Russia,
as Russia seeks to respond to its diplomatic isolation in the
Arctic from the other 7 Arctic states.
Chairman Gimenez. In order for the Coast Guard to conduct
its mission, how many icebreakers does the Coast Guard need?
What kind of mix is it that you----
Mr. O'Rourke. The Coast Guard has testified that their new
fleet mix analysis indicates a need for a total of 8 to 9.
That's an increase over the previously envisaged total of 6
that included 3 heavys. So, now we're looking at 8 to 9,
presumably still including 3 heavys.
Chairman Gimenez. Fair enough. Final one observation is
that the Chinese, the PRC, has fishing fleets around the world.
I said also on the Select Committee on China we are going to be
looking at those activities. Apparently they are raping the
oceans, OK. So, my concern would be the same, they would try to
do the same thing in the Arctic region. So, maybe that is part
of the reason, too, why they want access to those fisheries up
in the Arctic region.
Mr. O'Rourke. Yes. China's world-wide fishing activities
are a growing concern, including what is referred to as IUU
fishing, illegal, unreported, unregulated fishing. As
conditions in the Arctic change, fish stocks may be migrating
further north. So, we have a dynamic situation of China
possibly being interested in northern fish stocks and the exact
locations of those fish stocks moving further northward in
response to warming waters.
Chairman Gimenez. Thank you. My time is up.
I now recognize the gentleman from California, Mr. Garcia.
Mr. Garcia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to our
witnesses. Thank you all for being here.
I just wanted to note that as our planet warms, obviously,
and sea levels rise due to climate change, the Arctic is also
melting at an unprecedented rate. The Arctic we know is
warming, melting several times faster than other regions across
the world. We know that this change is opening up new
challenges for all, particularly here in the United States, and
certainly opportunities for our adversaries to capitalize on.
The Arctic is also a case study in not only how climate
change impacts us globally--it certainly impacts our way of
life--but also impacts our national security. It is also, of
course, an economic issue. I represented the Ports of Long
Beach when I was mayor for 8 years, representing the ports
right now, largest container seaport in the United States, the
Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles. So, I know that there is
also trade implications when it comes to the Arctic and the
dangers around national security and economic security.
Now, 40 percent of our Nation's cargo go through the Ports
of Long Beach and Los Angeles. Our Nation's economic prosperity
depends on our ability to remain adaptive in this changing
maritime environment.
Dr. Brimmer, I wanted just to ask from an economic growth
standpoint, do you agree that the Arctic is also critical to
U.S. economic interests, both in terms of new commerce and
trade?
Ms. Brimmer. Thank you very much for your question, if I
may follow up on, particularly that indeed recognizing the
importance of port facilities is crucial to the economic health
of the United States, as you mentioned, particularly the Ports
of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Indeed, as we look at changing
dynamics, we see the importance of other regions, and I would
note particularly the Arctic.
Although we commented on the size of the coastline to the
Russian Federation, we know that there are significant
resources in the Arctic. The management of those will require
careful planning for years in the future. Managing future fish
stocks, managing other natural resources will be important.
Indeed, because of the rapid pace of climate change, we will
see increasing pressures for greater navigation through the
Arctic. But that will still be difficult even if we have
important resources that we all support in order to make it
possible to travel in that area. There will continue to be a
challenge and that will be important for the United States.
Mr. Garcia. Great. Thank you. So, we also have, of course,
national security issues here. So, the world is rapidly
changing. Our adversaries are quickly evolving with that
change. It is certainly essential to our national interests and
our security of our allies in the United States that we are
meeting this important moment.
Now, we have concerns that our operational capacity and our
competitiveness in the Arctic is falling behind both Russia and
China. I think that has been mentioned already here today. So,
the Coast Guard obviously needs the tools to operate in this
new landscape. As it has been mentioned, it has been discussed
also here, Russia has upwards of 40 operational icebreakers
while China is mobilizing their commercial shipping capacity.
You just obviously mentioned also the increasing that is
happening around fishing as well around the Arctic. The United
States, however, is still operating with just two polar
icebreakers. It is the same two icebreakers that we know that
we roughly had about 60 years ago.
Also, Dr. Brimmer, from a NATO perspective, with Finland
and Sweden's ascension to NATO, am I correct that the Arctic
presents a unique opportunity for us to strengthen our global
alliances with the other 6 Arctic NATO nations, particularly
around global civility and economic prosperity?
Ms. Brimmer. Yes, sir, indeed, this is a remarkable moment
for NATO, America's most important military alliance. Indeed,
the arrival of Finland brings with us a highly competent
country with expertise in the High North, which will be
extremely important. Of course, it also brings a land border
with the Russian Federation and Finland of over 800 miles. But
it also brings us expertise in the High North.
This will be increasingly important. Ironically, we're
having to go back to look at maps that were so familiar during
the Cold War. We're talking again about the Greenland-Iceland-
UK gap, that area in the North Atlantic which would be
important if there ever had to be resupply for Europe from
North America.
So, indeed, there's both importance strategically, yet this
is an opportunity for NATO to deepen its cooperation, drawing
on the expertise of its existing and new members in the defense
of our democracies.
Mr. Garcia. Thank you. I wanted with the time we have left,
Dr. Brimmer, in 2017, there was a bipartisan task force on
Arctic imperatives that of course you helped lead. You made it
clear, and I want to quote: ``that the U.S. needs to increase
its strategic commitment to the region or risk leaving its
interests unprotected.'' Now, the task force identified several
key goals around the Arctic. How do you think we are doing as a
country meeting these goals with the remaining time that we
have?
Ms. Brimmer. Sir, I would say our grade is only about a C+
at this point. We have made important developments since that
report in that now there is funding for the Polar Security
Cutters, which is extremely important, as my colleagues have
pointed out, that the United States has interests in the Arctic
and the Antarctic. However, we will need increased investment
in infrastructure and in diplomatic support for these new
obligations.
Mr. Garcia. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Chairman Gimenez. The gentleman's time has expired. I now
recognize the gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. Higgins.
Mr. Higgins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ma'am, gentlemen,
thank you for appearing before us today.
I had the great honor of sitting next to Don Young for 6
years, the Congressman that represented Alaska for so long, so
many decades. When I came to Congress in 2017, Don favored me,
sort-of put his arm around me and helped me navigate through
the complexities of this bizarre realm. I came to call him
friend. I have always respected my elder and Don shared great
wisdoms from his decades of serving the American people and the
people of Alaska.
So, I would like to jump into, Mr. O'Rourke, I am going to
discuss during my time of questioning the significance of the
Polar Security Cutter program and building icebreakers because
Don told me on several occasions that it was one of the most
important tasks that we could complete. He considered it legacy
stuff to get that done. It was so important that America had
presence and dominance in that technology and we were very much
falling behind our potential adversaries in the Arctic
regarding navigation.
We discussed climate change. Don made it clear. Don had
been a tugboat captain during the course of his life. He
understood the waters. He said there is always going to be ice.
So, regardless of climate change, it is not going to become the
Caribbean up there. So, you need icebreakers. The nature of the
ice may change, but we need vessels that can navigate
effectively with 21st Century technologies through Arctic
waters.
Mr. Chairman, I am going to be citing from, and therefore I
would like to submit for the record, the Congressional Research
Service report entitled ``Coast Guard Polar Cutter Security
Cutter Program Background and Issues,'' updated July 10, 2023,
to be submitted for the record, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Gimenez. So ordered.*

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr. Higgins. Thank you. Regarding the fiscal year 2024
procurement request, I fully support it. Mr. O'Rourke, I want
to clarify that because the significance of this program has
been made clear to me for 7 years now. I have very high
confidence in the Louisiana shipbuilder, Bollinger, who has
inherited that program with the purchase of the originally
contracted shipbuilder.
So, let's jump into the 2023 GAO report. May I do that with
you, Mr. O'Rourke? You are familiar with that report?
Mr. O'Rourke. My testimony was the June report from this
year that reported on the design completion for the ship.
Mr. Higgins. OK. They are related. I am referencing a
report from April of this year, which studied the development
of the program through September 30 of last year.
Mr. O'Rourke. Right. Mm-hmm.
Mr. Higgins. As of last year in September, here are some
quotes from the GAO reported. They stated that, ``Design
immaturity and the shipbuilder's inexperience working with the
specialized steel needed for hull construction remained the
program's top risk.'' They stated that, ``Oversight of the
program was hampered due to some shipbuilder's deficiencies.''
This was the nature of the program, I am just trying to
clarify, before the current shipbuilding contractor purchased
the program and the responsibility of completing it. Is that
correct?
Mr. O'Rourke. That's right 'cause their data was prior to
the shipyard sale.
Mr. Higgins. Roger that. So, in my remaining little bit
less than a minute, Mr. O'Rourke, please explain to America and
the committee just how important this program is and how
significant Congress' support for that program is for the
future stability of our Nation and indeed peace and prosperity
throughout the Western Hemisphere and beyond.
Mr. O'Rourke. Mm-hmm. Yes, I'd be happy to do that. I will
say that I attended any number of hearings over the year where
Representative Young was up on the dais, so I remember him very
well as well.
The Coast Guard will tell you that the PSC program is one
of its top two acquisition priorities, along with the Offshore
Patrol Cutter program. So, it doesn't get any higher than that.
Although two of the PSCs are now fully funded, we are in the
process of funding the third. The program of record includes at
least three PSCs. So, this year's funding request supports the
continued funding for that third ship.
As I mentioned earlier with the Chairman, these polar
icebreakers are central to the Coast Guard's ability to perform
its various statutory missions up in the Arctic, not just
icebreaking, although icebreaking clearly is quite important,
but the other 8 missions as well that are on the books for the
Coast Guard to perform up there.
Mr. Higgins. Roger that. Thank you, Mr. O'Rourke.
Mr. Chairman, I yield.
Chairman Gimenez. The gentleman's time has expired. Do you
require additional time?
Mr. Higgins. I have an additional question, Mr. Chairman.
Go to a second round.
Chairman Gimenez. Now, we are going through a second round.
I recognize myself for a second round. I yield my time to the
gentleman from Louisiana.
Mr. Higgins. Sir, if I could, Mr. Chairman, I would like to
shift to Russia. I think it is important that we acknowledge
the presence of Russia in the Arctic is historically reflective
of their Arctic territory that they hold. I believe there is on
the line of 4 million residents, human beings living in the
Arctic area, the designated area, and over half of those are
citizens of Russia. Their landmass, I believe they have over
1,500 miles of coastland or I don't exactly recall, but it is a
lot, much more, maybe 15,000 miles of coastland.
So, when you consider the entire weave of coast, the point
is that Russia has a right to a presence in the Arctic as
opposed to China. I think it is important, and I would like you
all to potentially address this, I think it is important that
the United States work with Russia regarding securing trade
routes and navigation routes that are emerging, as technology
for vessels emerge, and as the nature of Arctic ice changes. We
do not want Russia to partner with China, which we are
beginning to witness. This is a concern to me.
So, beginning with Mr. O'Rourke, if you could comment, and
then we will go to Mr. Coffey and Dr. Brimmer.
Mr. O'Rourke. Yes. I'll just make two quick points. One
would be to reinforce what I said earlier, that Russia's sense
of being diplomatically isolated from the 7 other Arctic states
as a consequence of the war in Ukraine has encouraged Russia to
increase its cooperation with China in the Arctic. That is
creating new opportunities for China in the Arctic that are
above those that they were already pursuing.
The other thing I'll note is that even though the war in
Ukraine has disrupted the operations of the Arctic Council and
has led to Russia's diplomatic isolation in other ways from the
other 7 Arctic states, there are still forms of cooperation
that continue, even in this situation. For example, the United
States and Russia continue to cooperate in the regulation of
sea traffic through the Bering Strait, in the performance of
the agreement that the two countries reached about the
regulation of that sea traffic in 2018. So, there is some
limited degree of cooperation under way between us and Russia,
even in this larger situation.
Mr. Higgins. Mr. Coffey.
Mr. Coffey. Thank you, Mr. Higgins. As a Arctic power, as
an Arctic state, as you alluded to, Russia has every right, and
it's Moscow's prerogative to deploy military forces, construct
military bases wherever it so chooses to, as long as it's on
the territory internationally recognized as being part of the
Russian Federation.
Where the concern lies is when you look at what Russia has
done in other regions around the world on its periphery,
whether it's in the Caucasus, South Caucasus in particular, in
Syria, of course with Ukraine. That's when there's a concern
that Russia might try something in the Arctic.
In terms of the idea of----
Mr. Higgins. Let me just interject. We concur that Russian
military presence is a threat world-wide. We are specifically
discussing the Arctic region. I ask you to stay focused on that
because it is a unique international challenge, the Arctic
region.
Mr. Coffey. Yes. As long as Russia maintains its military
forces inside the borders recognized as being part of the
Russian Federation, it's their prerogative to do what they want
with them. The concern will become when they decide to use
these forces outside of the borders of the Russian Federation.
In terms of the notion of cooperating with Russia, I don't
think this is a--in any meaningful sense, in the Arctic or
otherwise, I don't think that this is geopolitically possible
right now. There is a growing relationship between Beijing and
Moscow. But Beijing is very much the senior partner and Russia
is the junior partner.
I know, Mr. Higgins, you asked me to stay restricted to the
Arctic, but often these geopolitical issues are interconnected.
That is why a strong Ukraine will equal a safer and more secure
Taiwan. As China's junior partner, anything we do to weaken
Russia will indirectly weaken China. China is watching how we
respond to Ukraine because they have their eye on Taiwan. A
stronger Ukraine could perhaps deter China from doing something
in Taiwan.
Then, ultimately, this comes back to the Arctic----
Chairman Gimenez. My time has expired. We need to move on.
Sorry.
Right now, I recognize the gentleman from California, Mr.
Garcia.
Mr. Garcia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks again to our
witnesses.
I just wanted to also just follow up. The Arctic is--
obviously, we talked a little bit about the economic impacts,
there is climate impacts. We also know obviously national
security impacts, which we have discussed.
The Arctic is also home, of course, to people. Four million
people, as we know, inhabit the Arctic region today, many of
them also indigenous groups.
Dr. Brimmer, how does the U.S. Coast Guard and other
organizations serve the safety and well-being of those that
call the Arctic home?
Ms. Brimmer. Thank you very much for the question because,
indeed, out of the 4 million people who live in the Arctic,
about 500,000 of them are indigenous peoples. Indeed, those
include our fellow citizens in the great State of Alaska.
I would like to say that, indeed, that the Coast Guard
provides important search and rescue for people who are working
on the coast lines. As the coast lines change, there is greater
challenge for those, including those who are still subsistence
hunters, that it is important to have the infrastructure to
support the well-being of people who actually live in the
Arctic.
If I may combine this point with the earlier conversation
about the role of international organizations that support
people in the region, the Arctic in essence has layers of
international organizations. I will note that whatever the
future of the Arctic Council, the ability to bring together
indigenous people, including those in Alaska, is an important
support for those people. Whatever the venue is, that's an
important structure to help with human well-being and human
security.
Mr. Garcia. Also, as far as the Arctic Council, what role
does indigenous groups, indigenous peoples play in kind of the
international cooperation, you know, within the Arctic Council?
After Dr. Brimmer, if anyone else wants to also answer, that
would be great.
Ms. Brimmer. Indeed, the Arctic Council was unusual among
international organizations, in that it actually has a
structure for nongovernmental participation. There are 6 groups
associated with indigenous peoples that are part of the Arctic
Council. Four of those groups include people in Alaska. So,
they actually have an opportunity to speak and participate in
the activities of an international organization, which is
unusual and something that is of value to Americans in the
State of Alaska.
Mr. Garcia. Mr. Coffey, do have any additional comments on
that?
Mr. Coffey. No, only that I concur that regardless of the
future of the Arctic Council, there has to be some mechanism
that can help address the legitimate concerns and needs of the
indigenous peoples of the Arctic region.
Mr. Garcia. Great. Thank you. I yield back.
Chairman Gimenez. The gentleman yields back.
I recognize the gentleman from Louisiana again. Mr.
Higgins, do you have any additional questions?
Mr. Higgins. I would like to give Dr. Brimmer an
opportunity to respond to my line of questioning regarding the
significance of some level of cooperative engagement between
the United States as a heavy presence in the Arctic with the
geographically and population density-dominant international
presence in the Arctic, which is Russia, as opposed to allowing
Russia to develop a relationship in the Arctic with China. Dr.
Brimmer, would you respond to that line of questioning?
Ms. Brimmer. Thank you, sir, for the opportunity to respond
to that important question. If I may, I will highlight
particular points.
The first is that, of course, the United States and the
Russian Federation share important duties of search and rescue,
particularly in the Bering Strait. Indeed, that is one of our
oldest international principles, is search and rescue. So, both
countries take that very seriously.
Second, I will say that it is beneficial for the United
States to work with Russia in international bodies, such as the
International Maritime Organization, which is responsible for
the Polar Code that actually governs the requirements for ships
in the region. That's an important structure.
The third is to say that the Arctic Ocean itself, the
center, is the High Seas. So, in addition to the important
activities we've talked about in terms of our territorial
waters and our extended economic zone, there's actually a
portion that is beyond all national jurisdiction. Again, we
need to work with the Russian Federation and the other Arctic
countries in bodies that manage the High Seas.
Finally, to say that the expansion of NATO is extremely
important in this area, where it'll be important that the
United States works with its long-standing allies in the
Arctic, such as Norway and our new allies, such as Finland and
we hope Sweden. Because that work in the Arctic will
increasingly take up planning and strategic time for NATO as a
whole. Thank you.
Mr. Higgins. Thank you, Dr. Brimmer.
Mr. Coffey, I am going to give you an opportunity to
comment on the significance of the Coast Guard Polar Security
Cutter program, if you would, good sir.
Mr. Coffey. Yes. It is a key component of America's ability
to enforce its own sovereignty in America's Arctic region and
to protect our sovereignty from foreign adversaries. It is one
component of many that the Coast Guard will use to complete its
mandated missions, but it is important. Thank you.
Mr. Higgins. Thank you, sir. Thank you all for being here
today.
Mr. Chairman, I yield.
Chairman Gimenez. The gentleman yields.
I now recognize the gentleman from California, Mr. Garcia.
Mr. Garcia. I yield back.
Chairman Gimenez. The gentleman yields.
I now recognize the gentlelady from Florida, Ms. Lee.
Ms. Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate you holding
this important hearing.
All of our witnesses, we appreciate you for being here
today. The Arctic's growing strategic importance has made it
imperative that America is prepared to confront the unique
challenges and opportunities that this region presents. Your
experience and expertise is appreciated here today.
Mr. Coffey, I would like to begin with you and return to
the questions that you were engaged in with Mr. Higgins. In
particularly, you commented on some of the, I believe, common
interests in Russia and China in that region. I was interested
in your perspective on whether there is an area where the
interests of Russia and China in the Arctic diverge.
Mr. Coffey. Well, thank you for that question. As I alluded
to, Russia is very much the junior partner in this
relationship. One of the consequences of international economic
sanctions against Russia is that Russia has looked for other
markets and China has swooped in to take advantage of the
situation. Much of the energy that was once exported to Europe
is slowly finding its way to other places, including China, and
at below-market rates. So, China understands that it's in a
position to benefit in the maximum manner from its engagement
with Russia right now.
Right now, Russia is so dependent on China that I cannot
see a situation in the near future where Russia would become a
strategic competitor against China, certainly not one where
Russia would align with us to counter China or try to go
against China. In fact, I think it would be completely
impossible for the United States to engineer such an outcome to
the point that we shouldn't even try. We should acknowledge
that China and Russia will be our main strategic competitors in
the Arctic region, and we should develop and prepare our
national security architecture under that assumption.
Ms. Lee. Do you anticipate or foresee any scenario where
Russia could attempt to impede our access to the Northern Sea
Route, the United States or other countries?
Mr. Coffey. Well, international sanctions has actually
impeded the use of the Northern Sea Route. If you look at the
data from last year, not a single cargo ship, foreign cargo
ship, used the route. Not a single ship of any flag made the
full journey from Asia to Europe.
Russia has claimed that a lot of the Northern Sea Route is
internal waterways and that certain fees must be paid in order
to use this route. Then, of course, you are reliant on Russian
search and rescue and Russia's icebreaking capabilities, and
that also incurs cost.
So, right now, I wouldn't say that, you know, Russia is,
you know, preventing any internationally-flagged ship from
using the route. They either make it difficult or the
geopolitical circumstances, in this case economic sanctions,
make it cost-prohibitive.
The French have actually conducted freedom of navigation
operations, the French Navy has, up along the Northern Sea
Route. As far as I know, that is the only NATO country that has
done such a thing. But certainly, the United States would be
within its rights to do so. But whether or not right now would
be the right time for that is a matter for policy makers.
Ms. Lee. Mr. O'Rourke, I would like to bring you into this
conversation. What additional insight or perspective would you
add to what you have been hearing on this subject?
Mr. O'Rourke. Well, one of your earlier questions was about
a divergence of interests, if any, that exists between China
and Russia in the Arctic. There is potentially a latent one,
one in the background that may become more in the foreground at
one point. That concerns the Arctic Council.
China in the past has raised questions about the Arctic
Council as the correct institution or forum for Arctic
governance because they are more on the outside of that than
Russia is. Russia is one of the 8 voting states of the Arctic
Council. So, there's a potential for the two countries to
develop different viewpoints regarding the continuation of the
Arctic Council as the primary international forum for Arctic
governance.
The other thing I will mention is regarding the Northern
Sea Route, the Russian legislature has been active. They have
passed a new law regarding their regulation of the Northern Sea
Route that may put Russia more directly at odds with the U.S.
legal position regarding those claimed internal waters. Whereas
in the past we may not even have had a basis for having a
freedom of navigation operation because there was no excessive
claim regarding government ships, that may have changed now
with the passage of that new Russian law. So, that is another
situation that is worth watching.
Ms. Lee. Thank you. With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Chairman Gimenez. The gentlelady yields back.
Does anybody have any other questions? I will now recognize
the gentleman from California, Mr. Garcia.
Mr. Garcia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to go
back. So, the Biden-Harris administration's national strategy
for the Arctic region, which was published, of course, just
last year, is a vital step in creating a cross-agency plan for
the Arctic as it relates to the United States.
I wanted to start off by asking, Mr. O'Rourke, several
Arctic strategies have been developed in recent years by the
White House, DOD, Homeland Security, and the Coast Guard. Not
all have been fully implemented yet. So, how useful do you
think these Arctic strategies are? How would you characterize
the status of implementation?
Mr. O'Rourke. I think they're useful as a statement of
goals. They, in some cases, may be somewhat aspirational. If
you say that a strategy is something that has to reconcile
ends, ways, and means, then these documents, like many other
strategy documents that come out of the Executive branch, may
not actually pass the test of being a strategy in that regard,
of reconciling ends, ways, and means and setting priorities.
But they are useful in terms of identifying interests and
identifying lists of goals to be pursued and lines of effort
for attaining those goals.
Mr. Garcia. Thank you. Dr. Brimmer, what steps do you think
the Coast Guard should take to ensure that its Arctic
strategies align with the national strategy for the Arctic
region?
Ms. Brimmer. Thank you very much for the question. I think
it's important that in addition to the support for the
investments we've been discussing for the Coast Guard that they
continue an important relationship between the Coast Guard and
the State Department and the Defense Department is also
important. Indeed, the Coast Guard actually helps extend
American diplomacy by the work that it does with other
countries, both in the Arctic and around the world. So, I think
that's important to continue.
The types of structures that are important are interagency.
I will say that back when I was heading the International
Organizations Bureau, we used to say we were interagency before
it was fashionable. One of the great strengths of the United
States is the ability to integrate military, economic,
diplomatic, and other forms of power. That has to have an
interagency component, which means that resources such as the
Coast Guard and the Department of Homeland Security needs to
also work closely with our diplomatic community as part of
projecting America's interests internationally.
Mr. Garcia. Also, Dr. Brimmer, last, what key efforts and
metrics should the Coast Guard include when planning for its
own implementation of the national strategy?
Ms. Brimmer. Some of the things that should be considered
indeed are the types of challenges that the Coast Guard faces
because America faces them. One of them is first, of course,
defending sovereignty on our coastlines and other waterways.
But also, it means economic defense, such as guarding against
the illegal, underreported, and underregulated fishing as
another example in our maritime resources. So, those types of
considerations also need to be a part of planning for the Coast
Guard on its mission. Thank you.
Mr. Garcia. Thank you. I yield back.
Chairman Gimenez. The gentleman yields back.
Anybody else have any other questions?
Seeing none, I want to thank the witnesses for their
valuable testimony and for the Members for their questions.
Members of the subcommittee may have some additional
questions for the witnesses. We would ask the witnesses to
respond to these in writing, pursuant to committee rule VII(D).
The hearing record will be open for 10 days.
Without objection, this subcommittee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
