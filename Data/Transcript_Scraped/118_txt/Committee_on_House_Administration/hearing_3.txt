OPENING STATEMEMT OF HON. BRYAN STEIL, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM
WISCONSIN, CHAIRMAN, COMMITTEE ON HOUSE ADMINISTRATION

Chairman Steil. The Committee on House Administration will
come to order.
I note that a quorum is present.
Without objection, the Chair may declare a recess at any
time.
Thank you, Ranking Member Morelle and Members of the
Committee, for meeting today to adopt our Oversight Plan for
the 118th Congress.
Oversight and accountability matter. Following our first
Committee hearing with the now former Architect of the Capitol,
we know that, when we work together in a nonpartisan way, we
can deliver results for the American people.
With such a strong start right out of the gates, I am
excited to adopt this Oversight Plan to ensure that we keep the
momentum going.
Our Committee has an opportunity to help rebuild the
people's House by bringing robust oversight to all of our
legislative branch entities. We will start by making the House
more open, accessible, and transparent.
This means fully returning to a pre-COVID-19 posture across
the entire campus and creating more opportunities for the
American people to engage with Congress.
Further, Congress must be more responsible with how we are
spending taxpayer dollars. This includes bringing greater
transparency and accountability to the House operations to
ensure the legislative branch is strong enough to keep the
other branches accountable, all while being efficient with our
own resources.
To aid that strength, it is time to modernize Congress. By
coordinating among other legislative branch entities, we can
offer more modern and efficient support services for all
congressional offices, both in D.C. and the District, which, in
turn, will help all Members better serve people back home.
We must also invest in our workforce to ensure we are
providing the American people with the highest, most
professional level of service.
Finally, we have the great task of building a more
resilient House. Whether it is cybersecurity or physical
security, we will establish a path forward to address
outstanding inspector general recommendations and all
recommendations from post-January 6th security assessments, and
doing so will strengthen the overall security of the House so
Members and staff can focus on their legislative mission and so
Americans can safely and reliably access their government.
Our Committee has broad jurisdiction over federal
elections. Our role is limited, though. We must uphold our
Federalist principles. We will provide oversight over the
Federal Election Commission and Election Assistance Commission.
I also look forward to working with state and local
officials, as well as key stakeholders. We will highlight what
works and what some states can do better. This will ultimately
improve voter confidence in our elections. We must also
exercise Congress' constitutional responsibility over
Washington, DC, by implementing key election integrity tools
following years of poorly run elections.
At the Committee on House Administration, we have the
opportunity to make Congress better and restore faith in our
elections. This is our blueprint to do so.
I look forward to working together to continue delivering
results for the American people.
I now recognize the Ranking Member, Mr. Morelle, for
opening remarks.

OPENING STATEMEMT OF HON. JOSEPH MORELLE, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM
NEW YORK, RANKING MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON HOUSE ADMINISTRATION

Mr. Morelle. Good morning, all. I want to thank the
Chairman for calling this meeting and ensuring the Committee
follows the new requirements of House Rule X
Previously the text of the rule required consultation with
the Committee's minority when developing authorization and
oversight plans. Although that requirement was eliminated at
the beginning of this Congress, I do appreciate the opportunity
to provide the minority's views of the plan, and I appreciate
the thoughtful input from my Democratic colleagues in
developing these views.
As I mentioned in my opening statement during our
organizing meeting, the House Administration is a small but
impactful Committee, and I think I concur with the Chair about
this. The House rules task us with a number of important
legislative and oversight functions, and I hope that we can
continue to work toward a bipartisan agreement with fulfilling
many of the responsibilities, but there will be times where the
Chair and I and our Members just fundamentally disagree.
One major area of disagreement is the role we play in the
oversight of federal elections. The Constitution gives the
Congress and the House rules give this Committee the ultimate
authority over such elections. One aspect of the Oversight Plan
provides that we will review the 2022 election.
I welcome that opportunity. This examination will be
important as we continue to explore ways to ensure future
federal elections are free from misinformation, disinformation,
intimidation, and systemic voter disenfranchisement. I look
forward to working with my colleagues to protect the integrity
of the electoral process while safeguarding the absolute right
to vote. I don't think there is a more fundamental right
necessary for a functioning democracy.
Despite our philosophical disagreements and differences, we
can also find a great deal of common ground, and I think much
of that common ground is represented in the plan we are going
to adopt today.
We agree that the House should be efficient, modern, and
resilient, and we agree in fostering strong, productive
relationships with our institutional partners and legislative
branch agencies to achieve this end. The plan is more than just
a roadmap. It memorializes the priorities of the Committee and
is an important tool for the American people to hold us
accountable.
I think I speak for all Committee Members when I say I
welcome this accountability.
Again, thank you for the opportunity to address the
Committee, and I yield back, Mr. Chair.
Chairman Steil. I thank the Ranking Member.
As noted, Committee Resolution 118-10, the proposed
Oversight and Authorization Plan, has been distributed to
Members in advance.
Without objection, the resolution is considered as read and
open for amendment at any point.
[The resolution 118-10 follows:]
[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Chairman Steil. Does any member wish to be recognized to
discuss the draft Authorization and Oversight Plan?
Seeing none, are there any amendments?
If not, I move that Committee Resolution 118-10 be adopted.
All those in favor, signify by saying aye.
All those opposed, say nay.
The ayes have it, and the resolution is adopted.
Without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid on the
table.
I ask unanimous consent that the Committee adopt Resolution
118-09, authorizing the approval of a consultant contract
agreement between Stephen McMillin and the Committee on the
Budget.

Each Member will have 5 legislative days to insert
additional materials into the record or to revise and extend
their remarks.
If there is no further business, I thank the Members for
their participation.
Without objection, the Committee stands in adjournment.
[Whereupon, at 10:07 a.m., the Committee was adjourned.]

[all]
