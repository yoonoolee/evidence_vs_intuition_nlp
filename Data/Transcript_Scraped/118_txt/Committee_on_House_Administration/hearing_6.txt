Committee on House Administration,
House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.

The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 11:53 a.m., in
room 1310, Longworth House Office Building, Hon. Bryan Steil
[Chairman of the Committee] presiding.
Present: Representatives Steil, Loudermilk, Griffith,
Murphy, Lee, Carey, D'Esposito, Morelle, Sewell, Kilmer, and
Torres.
Staff present: Tim Monahan, Staff Director; Caleb Hays,
Deputy Staff Director, General Counsel, Acting Parliamentarian;
Hillary Lassiter, Chief Clerk; Janet Schwalb, Deputy Staff
Director of Advice & Guidance and Operations; Cade Alcock,
Assistant Clerk; Jamie Fleet, Minority Staff Director; Khalil
Abboud, Minority Deputy Staff Director; Matthew Schlesinger,
Minority Oversight Counsel; Owen Reilly, Minority Professional
Staff Member; Eddie Flaherty, Minority Chief Clerk; and Andrew
Garcia, Minority Staff Assistant.
The Chairman. The Committee on House Administration will
come to order. My attempt to scare Mr. Murphy, I think, was
successful.
We can't let you pass in our presence, because otherwise a
quorum would not be present. I do note that a quorum is
present, and, without objection, the Chair may declare a recess
at any time.
The meeting record will remain open for 5 legislative days
so members may submit any material they wish to be included
there.
I thank the Ranking Member, Mr. Morelle, and all members of
the Committee for participating in last week's two-part hearing
on committee funding. It took a lot of coordination over the
course of 2 days, spanning nearly 7 hours. In the end, we heard
from almost every Committee Chair and Ranking Member on their
proposed budgets and goals for the 118th Congress.
This is one of our core committee responsibilities, and I
thought it was a huge success. Yet prior to last week, the last
time committee funding went through regular order was during
the 115th Congress.
I find that unacceptable. Transparency and accountability
should be the standard, not the exception. As Chairman, it is
my priority to restore regular order as part of our commitment
to making the People's House open and accessible.
Now that we have provided each committee with the
opportunity to justify their budget requests, our next
responsibility is to set the funding levels. This is no easy
task.
As we learned last week, each committee plays a vital role
in Congress and collectively touches every aspect of American
life. From our national security and the border to our nation's
schools and workforce, each committee is tasked with serving
the American people.
As we are considering each budget, we have a responsibility
to ensure every committee has the necessary resources to
succeed and effectively execute their mission. However,
taxpayers have also entrusted us the responsibility of being
good stewards of their hard-earned dollars. That is why today's
markup is vital.
I anticipate that after today, additional resources will be
needed by the Judiciary Committee, which will be handled
through the committee reserve allocation process.
With the majority of the House's work conducted in
committees, this process ensures that committees are
accountable to the American people. In turn, we can restore the
American people's trust in this institution while making the
House more open, accessible, and transparent.
I now recognize the Ranking Member, Mr. Morelle, for the
purpose of providing an opening statement if he wishes.
Mr. Morelle. Thank you. I do want to thank you, Mr.
Chairman, for calling this business meeting of the Committee on
House Administration as it continues to do the important
organizational work necessary on behalf of the House.
Today, the committee will consider a variety of things,
most of which we have reached agreement on, and I am grateful
for that, namely committee resolutions to provide allowances
for committees to send official mail, hire paid interns, and a
new formula to determine the Members' Representational
Allowance that considers the unique makeup of each
congressional district.
These measures are critically important to the
institutional capacity and representational duties of the
House, and I support them.
We will also report a primary expense resolution that will
fund committees. This resolution was informed by the series of
hearings which you mentioned, Mr. Chairman, in this Committee
last week.
I again want to thank the Chairs and the Ranking Members
that appeared before us in this committee room to talk about
the work of their committees, the importance of the work, and
to justify their requests.
As I said in my opening statement last week, committee
funding is historically a bipartisan and collaborative
enterprise, and I am grateful and happy to see that continues
with this resolution.
We will also formally consider House Administration's views
and estimates for Fiscal Year 2024, which, somewhat curiously,
we will be doing without the benefit of having yet seen the
President's budget, which will be released, as I understand,
tomorrow.
Nevertheless, my colleagues on this side of the aisle and
on this side of the dais continue to support the historic and
worthwhile investments the Administration has made in America's
present and future, particularly in those agencies within this
committee's jurisdiction. That support is reflected in our
minority views which we have submitted.
Like the Authorization Oversight Plan the Committee adopted
last week, views and estimates are an important memorialization
of our priorities. I appreciate the opportunity to provide
House Administration Democrats' perspective. I am grateful to
you for that and certainly happy that we have reached, I think,
agreement. We hopefully will receive support for the
resolutions before us.
With that, I want to thank you, and I will yield back.
The Chairman. I thank the Ranking Member.
I will note that I share the frustration that we are being
forced to act before the President's budget is released. It is
frustrating, I think, to many of us in the House that the
President's budget is over a month late and counting. We look
forward to receiving the President's budget. I share your
frustration that we are forced to act prior to the President's
budget being released.
I now call up and lay before the Committee H. Res. 197, the
Committee Funding Resolution.
Without objection, the first reading of the resolution is
dispensed with.
[The Resolution follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

The Chairman. I now recognize myself for the purpose of
offering an amendment in the nature of a substitute.
Without objection, the reading of the amendment is
dispensed with and the substitute will be considered as
original text for the purposes of further amendments.
[The amendment follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

The Chairman. Are there any members who wish to speak on H.
Res. 197?
Are there any members who wish to offer an amendment?
If not, the question now occurs on the amendment in the
nature of a substitute.
All those in favor, say aye.
All those opposed, nay.
The ayes have it and the amendment is agreed to.
Without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid on the
table.
Hearing no objection, I move that the Committee Report H.
Res. 197, as amended, to the House favorably.
The question is now on the motion.
All those in favor, say aye.
All those opposed, no.
In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it and the
motion is agreed to.
I now call up Committee Resolutions 118-11, 118-12, 118-13,
118-14, to be considered en bloc.
Without objection, the reading is dispensed with and the
resolutions are considered read and open for amendment at any
point.
[The resolutions offered en bloc follow:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

The Chairman. Resolution 118-11 distributes the 2023
legislative year allowance of $2.6 million among each committee
for the compensation of interns.
Resolution 118-12 allocates the Official Mail Allowance to
each committee.
Resolution 118-13 adopts a revised formula to calculate the
Members' Representational Allowance.
I would like to thank Omar Awan, Enrique Bouchot, and John
Clocker at the CAO for their hard work on this revised formula.
Resolution 118-14 approves the Committee's budget views and
estimates.
I will now recognize Ranking Member Mr. Morelle if he would
like to give a statement regarding these resolutions.
Mr. Morelle. I am fine, Mr. Chairman. I will yield back.
The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Morelle.
Does any other member wish to be heard regarding the
resolutions?
Seeing none, I ask unanimous consent that these resolutions
be considered en bloc.
Hearing no objection, I ask unanimous consent that the
Committee adopt the en bloc resolution.
Hearing no objection again, the resolutions are adopted.
Without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid upon
the table.
Pursuant to House Rule XI, clause 2(l), I ask that the
committee members have the right to file supplemental,
additional, minority, and dissenting views, without objection.
Also without objection, staff is authorized to make any
necessary technical and conforming changes.
No other business before us, this meeting is adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 12:01 p.m., the committee was adjourned.]

[all]
