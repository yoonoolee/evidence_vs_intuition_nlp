OVERSIGHT OF ICE DETENTION FACILITIES: EXAMINING ICE CONTRACTORS'
RESPONSE TO COVID-19

----------

Monday, July 13, 2020

U.S. House of Representatives,
Committee on Homeland Security,
Subcommittee on Border Security,
Facilitation, and Operations,
Washington, DC.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:03 p.m., via
Webex, Hon. Kathleen M. Rice [Chairwoman of the subcommittee]
presiding.
Present: Representatives Rice, Payne, Correa, Torres Small,
Green, Clarke, Thompson (ex officio), Jackson Lee, Barragan,
Richmond, Higgins, Lesko, Joyce, Guest, and Rogers (ex
officio).
Also present: Represntative Neguse.
Miss Rice. The Subcommittee on Border Security,
Facilitation, and Operations will come to order.
Today this subcommittee meets to examine the response to
COVID-19 by 4 of the private contractors responsible for
managing facilities in the U.S. Immigration and Customs
Enforcement detention network.
As coronavirus cases continue to spike Nation-wide, we must
ensure that the contractors our Government relies on are taking
every step they can to minimize the spread of COVID-19 among
workers and detainees.
For fiscal year 2020, Congress appropriated approximately
$3.1 billion for more than 45,000 single adults and family ICE
detention beds and other custody operations. Over 80 percent of
these beds are operated daily by private contractors, some of
whom are at this hearing today. That is a large amount of
taxpayer money, which is funding a historically high number of
detention beds, and it demands oversight and accountability.
Detention facilities must be held to a high standard at all
times, but in this moment it is of vital importance. Yet, over
the past few months, it is clear that ICE and its contractors
have not taken this outbreak seriously and have not treated it
aggressively enough.
More than 3,000 detainees, 280 contractors, and at least 45
ICE employees assigned to detention facilities have now tested
positive for COVID-19. Sadly, we have lost at least 2
detainees, a potential third today in the State of Florida, and
5 contractors due to complications from the coronavirus after
exposure at detention facilities.
Despite these horrific losses, ICE is continuing normal
operations and contractors are following in lockstep. ICE
continues to transfer detainees between facilities and
contractors continue to accept them.
Further, there is overwhelming evidence that these
transfers have likely contributed to multiple COVID-19
outbreaks inside of ICE detention facilities across the United
States. We have also read reports and heard from current and
former employees that guidance issued by the 4 companies
represented here today suggested rationing personal protective
equipment.
While documents provided to the committee show that
management at a few facilities are attempting to practice
social distancing, the clearest way to prevent the spread of
this disease in these facilities is to pursue alternatives to
detention and release those detainees who pose no threat to
communities.
The high risk of exposure to COVID-19 at these facilities
is further exacerbated by inadequate medical care. Prior to the
pandemic, health services provided in detention facilities were
severely lacking and proved to be the source of most complaints
by detainees.
So it is no surprise that the current public health crisis
has only compounded that situation. Some facilities are
reportedly waiting days or weeks to test individuals, including
the most vulnerable detainees.
The bottom line is that much more needs to be done to stop
the spread of the coronavirus at these facilities. To protect
the health of both detainees and the American people, guidance
to facility personnel must be clear and explicit. Transfers
between facilities must be stopped immediately and adequate
medical care must be provided.
COVID-19 does not distinguish between U.S. citizens and
noncitizens and neither should we in our approach to protect
against it. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today
about what additional steps they will take to address this
pressing issue going forward.

I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today about what
additional steps they will take to address this pressing issue going
forward.

Miss Rice. The Chair now recognizes the Ranking Member of
the subcommittee, the gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. Higgins,
for an opening statement.
Mr. Higgins. Thank you, Madam Chair. It is wonderful to
join you in this meeting today on this very important topic,
and I thank the witnesses for being here today.
I further sincerely appreciate Chairman Thompson opening
the hearing room to Members to conduct official business. As
you know, it is my humble opinion that we should be conducting
our important oversight and legislative missions here in the
District of Columbia in person, and I look forward to the
return of regular order.
Let me state that I find it disappointing that the Majority
did not invite ICE to a hearing that focuses on ICE. ICE could
update us on the preventive measures they have taken to address
COVID-19, the implementation of CDC and prevention
recommendations, and further guidance they provided to
detention facility contractors who will be joining us today.
Under President Trump's administrative direction, ICE
activated its pandemic work force protection plan in January of
this year in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. That plan
provides an additional layer of safety measures on top of ICE's
performance-based National detention standards.
ICE also convened a working group of medical professionals,
disease control specialists, detention experts, and field
operators to identify further steps to protect detainees. As a
result, the populations of ICE dedicated to the detention
facilities were reduced to 70 percent capacity. The CDC
recommendation is 75 percent.
This reduction included the review of nearly 34,000
detainees in custody Nation-wide to identify those with high
risk of severe illness potentially due to COVID-19. As a
result, more than 900 detainees who posed a low risk to public
safety were released. We can all agree that these are
unprecedented times, and while I commend ICE for going above
and beyond CDC guidance there is certainly more that needs to
be done.
As of July 7, 3.7 percent of those in ICE custody or 835
individuals have tested positive for COVID-19. However, today
in a hearing where we will heavily discuss the agency's
response to COVID-19 and the threat thereof, ICE was not
invited to testify.
ICE should be here to update us on what further measures
are taken to address COVID-19, what additional improvements
could be made. ICE should be here to tell us what issues have
arisen and how they have overcome them or not. ICE should be
here to answer questions about the new information we received
from these contractors as a result of the Chairman's very
professional document production request.
ICE should be before us today, but they are not here. Quite
frankly, today's hearing topic is--I respectfully submit is
outside our committee's jurisdiction, with this witness panel
making it quite a stretch. Today we have the presidents and
CEOs from 4 Government contractors who have to respond to
repeated document production requests and testify before a
committee with tertiary jurisdiction at best.
Any legislation related to this topic, immigration
detention and immigration laws, would not be referred to this
subcommittee. On its face, it seems the purpose of this hearing
is perhaps politically driven. Perhaps it is important to get
the message out. I agree with the substance of what we seek,
Madam Chair and Mr. Chairman, respectfully. I just--I believe
ICE should be here to speak for themselves.
We create an ever-moving goal post for hard-working Federal
employees and contractors who are simply doing their jobs,
abiding by the laws as prescribed by Congress. The truth is
nearly half of those in ICE custody on this day have final
orders of removal, nearly half. The majority of individuals
still in custody have either criminal convictions or charges
pending ranging from aggravated assault to homicide.
These crimes committed in the United States are not taken
lightly and they shouldn't be, yet some of my colleagues across
the aisle seem to prefer that anyone detained by ICE should be
released no matter what crime that individual has committed or
how much of a public safety risk they represent.
It is completely righteous for us to question ICE's
treatment and response to COVID-19, but let us not go too far.
I hope we can cut through politics. The Chairwoman and I have
attempted to do so in the past. We shall continue that endeavor
today. I look forward to speaking and listening.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I yield back.
[The prepared statement of Ranking Member Higgins follows:]
Statement of Ranking Member Clay Higgins
July 13, 2020
Thank you Madam Chair, and thank you to the witnesses for being
here today.
I appreciate Chairman Thompson opening the hearing room to Members
to conduct official committee business. We should be conducting our
important oversight and legislative missions here in Washington.
Hopefully we will return to regular order as soon as possible to get to
work for the American people.
First let me state, that I find it disappointing that the Majority
did not invite Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to update us
on the preventative measures they've taken to address COVID-19, the
implementation of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
recommendations, and further guidance they've provided to detention
facility contractors.
Under the Trump administration's direction, ICE activated its
pandemic workforce protection plan in January of this year in response
to the COVID-19 outbreak.
That plan provides an additional layer of safety measures on top of
ICE's Performance-Based National Detention Standards.
ICE also convened a working group of medical professionals, disease
control specialists, detention experts, and field operators to identify
further steps to protect detainees.
As a result, the populations of ICE-dedicated detention facilities
were reduced to 70 percent capacity. The CDC recommendation is 75

agency's response to COVID-19, ICE was not invited to testify.
ICE should be here to update us on what further measures they're
taking to address COVID-19 and what additional improvements can be made
in the future.
ICE should be here to tell us what issues have arisen and how
they've overcome them.
ICE should be here to answer questions about the new information we
received from these contractors as a result of the Chairman's document
production request.
ICE should be here before us today, but they weren't invited.
Quite frankly today's hearing topic is outside our committee's
jurisdiction, with this witness panel making it even more of a stretch.
Today we have the Presidents and CEOs from 4 Government contractors
who have to respond to repeated document production requests and
testify before a committee with tertiary jurisdiction at best.
Any legislation related to this topic, immigration detention, and
immigration laws would not be referred to this committee.
On its face it seems the purpose of this hearing is to further the
radical leftist narrative on open borders, abolishing ICE, Government
contractors, and defunding Federal agencies charged with securing the
homeland as we've heard time and time again from some of my colleagues
across the aisle.
It creates ever-moving goal posts for hard-working Federal
employees and contractors who are simply doing their jobs; abiding by
the laws prescribed by Congress.
The truth is, nearly half of those in ICE custody today have final
orders of removal.
The majority of individuals still in custody have either criminal
convictions or charges pending ranging from aggravated assault to
homicide to rape.
These crimes committed in the United States are not to be taken
lightly, yet some of my colleagues across the aisle don't want anyone
to be detained by ICE no matter what crime that individual has
committed or how much of a public safety risk they represent.
I hope we can cut through the politics during our questioning
today, and I hope next time the Majority actually invites the Federal
agency they are critiquing so we get all the facts.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I yield back.

Miss Rice. I want to thank the Ranking Member and also just
add that it appears that DHS components are referring to an OMB
guidance about avoiding remote hearings, which is why I believe
they would not respond.
But I would be more than happy to put the question directly
to them, but that is apparently what we have been informed,
that they are refusing to participate based on the guidance of
OMB in any remote hearings. But I thank you for raising that
issue, Mr. Ranking Member.
Members are reminded that the subcommittee will operate
according to the guidelines laid out by the Chairman and
Ranking Member in their July 8 colloquy.
With that, I ask unanimous consent to waive committee rule
8(a)2 for the subcommittee during remote proceedings under the
covered period designated by the Speaker under House resolution
965.
Without objection, so ordered.
Without objection, Members not sitting on the subcommittee
will be permitted to participate in today's hearing.
The Chair now recognizes the Chairman of the full
committee, the gentleman from Mississippi, Mr. Thompson, for an
opening statement.
Mr. Thompson. Thank you very much, Madam Chair.
Good afternoon to all the Members present. I am glad to
have this opportunity to speak with our witnesses about this
important topic, immigration detention contractors' response to
COVID-19.
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought illness and death to
communities across our country, with more than 135,000
Americans losing their lives to coronavirus. My home State is
not exempt. Over 1,200 of my fellow Mississippians have
tragically succumbed to the pandemic, and cases continue to
increase.
This suffering has fallen disproportionately on minority
communities, who often lack access to adequate health care.
Those who reside in congregate settings, including detention
facilities, are also particularly vulnerable.
Even before the pandemic, many ICE detention facilities had
a troubled record, with numerous complaints lodged about health
and safety issues, poor living conditions, and inadequate
inspections. These issues, combined with the risk of infection
in any crowded space, can lead to outbreaks inside detention
facilities.
By the most recent reporting, thousands of ICE detainees
across more than 70 detention facilities have tested positive
for COVID-19. This unfortunately includes 35 detainees at the
Karnes Family Residential Center in Karnes City, Texas, which
is operated by the GEO Group. This situation cannot continue.
ICE and its contractors must do their part to slow the spread
of COVID-19 in the interest of saving lives and protecting our
country.
I thank the witnesses for their replies to my April 29
letter requesting information on how they are mitigating the
spread of COVID-19 in their facilities. However, I would note
the productions have only been partially responsive.
I hope today to get a clear commitment from each company to
be more transparent about their practices and what they are
seeing in their facilities during this public health crisis.
ICE has been publicly reporting on the numbers of affected
detainees and Federal employees, but a major gap in this
reporting remains the number of contract personnel who have
tested positive for COVID-19. The public deserves to know this
information.
The DHS inspector general also recently issued an initial
report informed by surveys distributed to facilities across
ICE's detention network. Those surveys allowed facilities to
self-assess their preparedness and response to the pandemic,
but there appeared to be a disconnect between issued guidance
and implementation of that guidance.
Similarly, my staff found serious implementation gaps when
reviewing the documents each of your companies provided in
response to my request. We have seen public reporting and heard
from whistleblowers concerned with how ICE private contractors
are managing this situation.
I ask for unanimous consent to enter into the record a
letter from the Government Accountability Project, which
represents multiple whistleblowers who are alarmed by the
LaSalle Corrections operations at the Richwood Correctional
Center in Louisiana.

Re: Whistleblower Disclosures on COVID-19--Private Contractors
Mismanaging ICE Detention Facilities Are Endangering Public Health and
Safety.

Dear Committee and Subcommittee Chairpersons and Ranking Members:
Government Accountability Project submits this letter for the record to
summarize information from whistleblowers concerning mismanagement of
COVID-19 issues by LaSalle Corrections (LaSalle), a private company
contracted by U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Immigrations
and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to operate immigration detention
facilities.
Government Accountability Project is a global leader in
whistleblower advocacy and protection. Our lawyers have represented
whistleblower employees for over four decades, employees who, among
other things, have exposed government and corporate illegality, waste,
fraud, abuse, and serious dangers to public health and safety.
We currently represent multiple whistleblowers who have raised the
alarm about health threats posed to workers, immigrants, and the public
by the spread of COVID-19 in ICE detention. This letter summarizes
evidence provided by our clients detailing ongoing gross mismanagement,
dangerous practices, and compliance failures that has exacerbated, and
continues to exacerbate, the spread of COVID-19, posing imminent
dangers to the health and safety of staff, detainees, their families
and friends and the public.
Specifically, problems identified by whistleblowers at Richwood
Correctional Center (Richwood) in Louisiana, operated by LaSalle,
illustrates how mismanagement at detention centers accelerate the
current public health crises. To date, whistleblowers report that at
least 15 officers and 72 detainees have been infected with COVID-19,
two officers have died and at least four hospitalized detainees have
been placed on ventilators. These deaths and illnesses were likely
caused by LaSalle mismanagement.
The information here was provided to us by two groups of
whistleblower clients: (i) DHS's own medical subject-matter experts in
detention health who have continued to warn DHS and Congress about ICE
detention facilities being ``tinder boxes'' for the spread of COVID-19;
and (ii) staff who are either are or were employed at Richwood from the
onset of the pandemic through today.
a. whistleblowers: dhs's subject-matter medical experts on detention
health
Government Accountability Project represents Drs. Scott Allen and
Josiah ``Jody'' Rich, Nationally-recognized experts in detention
health. They are physicians and subject-matter experts employed by the
Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) within DHS. Dr. Allen
has inspected multiple immigration detention facilities across the
country over the past 6 years. He also serves as the court-appointed
monitor overseeing medical care for jails in Riverside County,
California. Dr. Rich specializes in infectious disease and public
health. He has provided care at the Rhode Island Department of
Corrections for decades and is currently caring for hospitalized
coronavirus-infected patients.
Drs. Allen and Rich began raising alarms about COVID-19 to CRCL in
late February 2020 and again in mid-March. They alerted DHS leadership
and others to the imminent risk to the health and safety of ICE
detainees, staff, and the public caused by detaining people in
congregate settings like ICE and other DHS detention facilities. They
wrote to Congress on March 19, 2020,\1\ and Dr. Allen testified before
the Senate Judiciary Committee on June 2, 2020.\2\

In their disclosures they reported:

Infectious diseases, like COVID-19, spread rapidly in
congregate settings.

Transport of detainees typically occurs in congregate
settings.\3\ As Dr. Allen told the Senate last month, ``Jails,
prisons, and detention facilities are not islands--in fact,
they are more like bus terminals with people coming and going.
New arrestees and detainees arrive every day, in fits and
spurts, sometimes arriving in large groups. Immigrants are
transferred regularly throughout the detention system, with
staff accompanying them as escorts. They are released without
warning at court and immigrants are dropped at bus stations and
airports. Officers and staff come and go, 3 shifts a day. And
the virus can easily move back and forth by means of the
asymptomatic ``silent spreaders'' who carry the virus but do
not have symptoms.''\4\

Asymptomatic spreaders, including children, pose risks as
carriers of infection, which can then spread the virus to older
family members or those in other high-risk categories who may
be a higher risk of serious illness.

Social distancing, which is essential to slow the spread of
the coronavirus to minimize the risk of infection and to try to
reduce the number of those needing medical treatment from
overwhelmed local health care providers and facilities, is an
oxymoron in congregate settings. Because of the concentration
of people in a close area with limited options for creating
distance between detainees, workers and immigrants are at very
high risk for an outbreak of infectious disease. This then
creates an enormous public health risk, not only because
disease can spread so quickly, but because those who contract
COVID-19 with symptoms that require medical intervention will
need to be treated at local hospitals, thus increasing the risk
of infection to the public at large and overwhelming treatment
facilities.

Dozens of immigration detention centers are in remote areas
with limited access to health care facilities. Many facilities,
because of the rural locations, have only 1 on-site medical
provider. If that provider gets sick and requires being
quarantined for at least 14 days, the entire facility could be
without any medical providers at all during a foreseeable
outbreak of a rapidly infectious disease.\5\

\5\ Data from the COVID Prison Project shows that prison
populations test substantially higher than the general population in
many States. See Erin McCauley, ``COVID-19 Case Watch May 27, 2020,''
COVID Prison Project Blog (May 30, 2020), available at https://
covidprisonproject.com/blog. Similarly, a new study in the Journal of
Urban Health shows that optimistically, 72 percent of individuals in
ICE detention are expected to be infected by day 90, with nearly 100
percent infected under more pessimistic conditions; the study further
shows that COVID-19 outbreaks among a minimum of 58 ICE facilities (52
percent) would overwhelm ICU beds within a 10-mile radius. ``Modeling

Even in the best circumstances, the provision of medical
care in correctional and detention facilities is inconsistent
and inadequate. While some do a very good job in providing
care, others perform poorly.\6\

Drs. Allen and Rich made a number of recommendations to Congress:

Robust Testing is Essential.--For every one detainee
identified and isolated using symptom-based screening, several
more pass in, and eventually out of, the facility without
symptoms.\7\ Testing must be done aggressively to isolate
infected individuals, monitor them and break the chain of
transmission as early as possible.\8\

earlier and more extensively, it would have ``confirmed'' and faced
additional pressure to respond to the many more infected persons in its
custody.'')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Significant Reduction of Populations in Detention is Both
Possible and Necessary to Protect the Public Health.--
Populations must drop to create space for distancing and
separation. Because all those in immigration detention are
civil, not criminal, detainees,\9\ and because ICE has complete
discretion to control the size of that population,\10\ where
detention is associated with greater risk of harm due to
outbreak and spread of the virus within the facility and to the
community, the detention of civil detainees who represent low-
to-no risk of criminality simply cannot be justified.\11\ This
is particularly true of continuing to hold children in
immigration detention, a practice which already carries high
risk of serious harm to their long-term physical and mental
health,\12\ risks which are only heightened by COVID-19.

Data Collection and Data Sharing is Critical, and Currently
Inadequate.--To date, correctional and detention facilities
have largely been omitted from National, State, and local COVID
response plans, with no correctional health experts appointed
to the White House Coronavirus Task Force,\13\ and different
States issuing reopening guidelines that fail to account for
often dramatically disproportionate infection rates in prisons
and detention facilities.\14\ Further, data collection and
sharing is inconsistent and frequently nontransparent, making
assessments of the spread of COVID-19 difficult and likely
underestimated.\15\ Data should be freely shared back and forth
between facilities and public health authorities in real time
to best support effective containment efforts. Because
infection can spread both ways--from facility to community and
from community to facility--both intake screening, release
planning, and release execution needs to accommodate COVID-19
containment strategies developed through collaboration between
ICE, correctional and detention facilities, public health
authorities, correctional health professionals, and post-
release service providers.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Drs. Allen's and Rich's warnings to Congress on March 19, 2020 and
Dr. Allen's more recent written testimony to the Senate Judiciary
Committee on June 2, 2020 highlight several important points:
(1) DHS had knowledge from its own medical experts in detention
health since at least late February 2020, and more widely since
March 20, 2020,\16\ that immigration detention facilities posed
a uniquely high risk of spread of COVID-19 to workers,
immigrants, and the public;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\16\ Catherine Shoichet, ``Doctors warn of `tinderbox scenario' if
coronavirus spreads in ICE detention,'' CNN (March 20, 2020), available
at https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/20/health/doctors-ice-detention-
coronavirus/index.html.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) The congregate nature of immigrant detention makes compliance
with detention standards related to medical care and CDC
guidelines both critical and difficult.--Social distancing,
adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), frequent
handwashing, and sanitizing the frequently-shared surfaces of
dorms, door handles, and other common areas are uniquely
challenging in detention settings, which is why other settings,
like schools and nursing homes, have focused on closures and/or
population reduction;
(3) The steady rotation of ICE and contractor staff for work
shifts, and frequent transfers of immigrant detainees between
facilities and for deportation through airports, dramatically
exacerbates the spread of COVID-19;
(4) Failures to adequately test and report infections of both
detainees and all ICE and ICE-contractor staff puts worker,
detainee, and the public's health at greater risk.
b. whistleblowers: richwood staff
Reports from whistleblowers we represent, who are current or former
detention officers at Richwood, further corroborate the concerns voiced
by Drs. Allen and Rich.
The Federal whistleblower laws, specifically 41 U.S.C.  4712,
protect employees of Federal contractors, like LaSalle, who make
protected disclosures of misconduct, gross mismanagement, abuses of
authority, and specific dangers to public health and safety. Our
clients, who wish to remain anonymous, have already made, or expect to
make such disclosures to DHS OIG. They have also reported their
concerns to LaSalle management.
The disclosures include:
Lasalle Has Concealed the Nature and Extent of COVID-19
Whistleblowers currently believe at least 15 officers and 72
detainees are or have been sick with COVID-19. Two officers died in
April. Detainees are or have been on ventilators. LaSalle management
has not disclosed or acknowledged the deaths. As a result, morale has
and is suffering, and staff fear they are at risk of contracting COVID-
19.
LaSalle Is Not Following COVID-19 Guidance
ICE has issued guidance for its operations on COVID-19.\17\ CDC has
done the same, specifically focused on detention and correctional
facilities.\18\ They call for the use of personal protective equipment
(PPE), including face masks, by staff.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\17\ ``ICE Guidance on COVID-19,'' available at https://
www.ice.gov/coronavirus. In addition, ICE detention facilities are
bound to follow the Performance-Based National Detention Standards
(PBNDS), which state that ``Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) guidelines for the prevention and control of infectious and
communicable diseases shall be followed.'' Immigration and Customs
Enforcement, PBNDS 2011, Medical Care, Section 4.3, available at
https://www.ice.gov/doclib/detention-standards/2011/4-3.pdf.
\18\ CDC, ``Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease
2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities'' (March 23,
2020), available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/
downloads/guidance-correctional-detention.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our clients report that the guidance has not been followed. For
example, on March 11, 2020, the Governor of Louisiana declared a public
health emergency due to COVID-19.\19\ However, Richwood management
prohibited staff from wearing face masks until the week of April 8,
2020. By that time, several detainees and staff were infected with
COVID-19.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\19\ Available at https://gov.louisiana.gov/assets/ExecutiveOrders/
25-JBE-2020-COVID-19.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Similarly, 2 days after the Governor's declaration, Richwood's
health service administrator held a staff meeting, where he said COVID-
19 was not a big deal, erroneously it was no worse than the flu.
Moreover, he said that that employees who had not bothered to get flu
shots now had no right to complain about the need for extra COVID-19
precautions.
The CDC guidelines also state that staff should be able to stay
home if they are sick and where possible they should be allowed to work
from home. The guidelines provide that staff who are at higher risk of
contracting COVID-19 be should have their duties revised to reduce that
risk.
But LaSalle has in place at Richwood policies and procedures which
effectively contravene CDC guidance. For instance, sick and at-risk
staff were not allowed to use their personal leave in order stay away
from the facility for their own protection. Staff suspected of
suffering from COVID-19 who had been tested were required to report for
work until such time as they tested positive tests, notwithstanding the
known high unreliability of the tests. Staff who did not show up for
work because of fear of COVID-19 infection were not paid.
Mismanagement Has Produced an Unsafe Work Environment
Our clients report inadequate sanitation supplies and PPE at
Richwood, which they believe has caused staff to get sick. They feel
unsafe at work.
The situation is as bad if not worse for detainees. Our clients
report that mask use was not being required around COVID-positive
detainees. The situation led to detainees threatening a hunger strike
because the officers were not wearing masks.
Staff Shortages and Retaliation
COVID-19 illnesses have caused an on-going staff shortage that
requires staff to work 12 hours per day, 7 days per week, with no time
off. Such an exhausting schedule necessarily increases the risk of
accidents and other serious incidents putting staff, detainees, and the
public at further risk.
Our clients have also reported they suffered retaliation after
raising health and safety concerns with Richwood management. They have
been fired or have been forced to quit. At least 10 staff were fired
under the guise of not passing a new background check.
Improper Mixing of Sick and Healthy Detainees
Our clients report that sick and healthy detainees have been held
together in a variety of communal settings, including during frequent
transport. Practices and procedures have made the situation worse. For
instance, Richwood drivers were reprimanded for wearing PPE and
cleaning their vehicles. Whistleblowers also reported that COVID-19-
positive and symptomatic detainees are transported with asymptomatic
staff and detainees, and that small vehicles rather than larger buses
are often used to transport detainees.
Deporting Infected Detainees
According to one whistleblower, detainees who tested positive for
COVID-19 were deported by plane and LaSalle transported them to the
Alexandria Staging Facility (ASF) in the same vehicle as healthy
detainees. A whistleblower said that when the airline complained,
Warden DeBellevue justified the risk by alleging that the infected
patient's test results were a ``false positive.'' ICE reported on their
website that ICE Air brought U.S. citizens and residents back to the
United States during the outbreak on the same aircraft used to deport
immigrants.\20\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\20\ As of April 10, 2020, ICE Air flew over 1,000 U.S. citizens
home amid the pandemic on the return leg of removal flights. https://
www.ice.gov/news/releases/ice-air-has-flown-over-1000-us-citizens-home-
amid-covid-19-pandemic.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Although ICE has a policy to screen deportees for temperature
checks, a whistleblower reports that the temperature gauges used were
inaccurate and that LaSalle staff were ordered to turn on the air
conditioning to maximum to ``freeze them out'' so the detainees will
not be refused for deportations. LaSalle and Richwood medical ordered a
whistleblower to write down a made-up temperature on the medical
transfer summary. A whistleblower reports that some deportees had a
temperature of 102 degrees Fahrenheit and the demand to manipulate the
temperature reading by ``freezing them out'' lowered it to 98.6 degrees
so they could travel (internal temperatures were not taken;
temperatures were taken from the foreheads of the deportees).
Finally, COVID-19 detainees have also been improperly housed in the
same building assigned to detainees suffering from tuberculosis. We
have been informed that while COVID-19 detainees were quarantined in a
separate building in Richwood, detainees with tuberculosis were placed
in the same setting (some had been misdiagnosed as COVID-19), creating
a potential disease bomb where detainees could potentially contract 2
extremely dangerous diseases. CDC Guidelines are clear: COVID-19 cases
should be placed isolated in a separate environment from other
individuals and cohorting, and should only be practiced if there are no
other available options. Applicable detention standards further specify
that detainees with tuberculosis are also to be kept in isolation. We
have been informed LaSalle had other available options.
Detainees Were Not Adequately Tested
According to CDC guidelines, after being infected with COVID-19,
individuals should test negative in 2 consecutive respiratory specimens
collected at least 24 hours apart, of if they are not tested, they must
be free from fever for 72 hours without fever-reducing medication and
have improved symptoms before they can return from medical isolation.
According to our clients, nurses said the detainees were never
retested before they were returned back to the dorms after testing
positive. They were simply sent back to the dorms after 14 days and
never retested. At least three detainees tested negative, returned to
Richwood no longer in isolation, and then returned to the hospital
because they still had COVID and they ended up in the intensive care
unit at the hospital.
Sanitary Guidelines Not Followed
CDC Guidelines for detention facilities require surfaces to be
disinfected--especially in common areas--several times each day.\21\ We
have been informed that this practice is not being followed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\21\ CDC, ``Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease
2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities'' (March 23,
2020), available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/
downloads/guidance-correctional-detention.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
According to a whistleblower, the dorms were only sanitized once a
day ``if they had time,'' though dorms were required to be cleaned
every 3 hours or 4 times per shift. Concerns were raised to Warden
DeBellevue about the lack of cleaning of the common areas; there was no
response from the Warden. A week later the safety officer issued a
cleaning schedule, but reported to one of the whistleblowers that he
couldn't get the officers or the trustees to clean after implementing
the schedule.\22\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\22\ Trustees are prisoners with a criminal record who, on good
behavior, are allowed to work. They were responsible for cleaning the
facilities and for serving food to the detainees. It's worth noting
that approximately 3 trustees who were serving food to immigrant
detainees tested positive for COVID-19 and then were removed from the
food service duties and then quarantined. LaSalle officers were asked
to serve food to detainees after that.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
We appreciate the oversight the House Committee on Homeland
Security's Subcommittee on Border Security, Facilitation & Operations
is conducting on this issue at its upcoming July 13, 2020 hearing,
Oversight of ICE Detention Facilities: Examining ICE Contractors'
Response to COVID-19, and hope that our clients' whistleblower
disclosures support urgent efforts needed to address the on-going and
imminent dangers to worker, immigrant, and public safety posed by the
spread of the coronavirus in ICE detention.

Mr. Thompson. The Government Accountability Project also
represents subject-matter experts who are employed by DHS to
advise on detention health issues but whose input seems to have
been ignored. The letter describes extremely concerning
mismanagement that no doubt has made the crisis unfolding in
ICE detention facilities that much worse.
This is not the end of this committee's oversight of
conditions at ICE detention facilities during COVID-19. Even
before the pandemic, the committee was actively examining
persistent problems at those facilities. That work will
continue. Today I urge each one of ICE's detention contractors
to be more aggressive in their response to COVID-19.
I also hope that as the tragic public health crisis
continues that ICE will use its discretion and maximize the use
of alternatives to detention program, which the GEO Group has
managed for years, to limit the spread of COVID-19 in
detention.
I urge our witnesses to re-examine how they have approached
the problem of COVID-19 within their facilities and to continue
their engagement with us to improve these conditions.
Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. I yield back.
[The statement of Chairman Thompson follows:]
Statement of Chairman Bennie G. Thompson
July 13, 2020
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought illness and death to communities
across our country, with more than 135,000 Americans losing their lives
to the coronavirus. My home State is not exempt. Over 1,200 of my
fellow Mississippians have tragically succumbed to the pandemic, and
cases continue to increase.
This suffering has fallen disproportionately on minority
communities, who often lack access to adequate health care. Those who
reside in congregate settings, including detention facilities, are also
particularly vulnerable. Even before the pandemic, many ICE detention
facilities had a troubled record, with numerous complaints lodged about
health and safety issues, poor living conditions, and inadequate
inspections.
These issues, combined with the risk of infection in any crowded
spaces, can lead to outbreaks inside detention facilities. By the most
recent reporting, thousands of ICE detainees across more than 70
detention facilities have tested positive for COVID-19. This
unfortunately includes 35 detainees at the Karnes Family Residential
Center in Karnes City, Texas, which is operated by the GEO Group. This
situation cannot continue.
ICE and its contractors must do their part to slow the spread of
COVID-19 in the interest of saving lives and protecting our country. I
thank the witnesses for their replies to my April 29 letters requesting
information on how they are mitigating the spread of COVID-19 in their
facilities. However, I would note the productions have only been
partially responsive.
I hope today to get a clear commitment from each company to be more
transparent about their practices and what they are seeing in their
facilities during this public health crisis. ICE has been publicly
reporting on the numbers of affected detainees and Federal employees,
but a major gap in this reporting remains the number of contract
personnel who have tested positive for COVID-19. The public deserves to
know this information.
The DHS inspector general also recently issued an initial report
informed by surveys distributed to facilities across ICE's detention
network. Those surveys allowed facilities to self-assess their
preparedness and response to the pandemic, but there appeared to be a
disconnect between issued guidance and implementation of that guidance.
Similarly, my staff found serious implementation gaps when
reviewing the documents each of your companies provided in response to
my request. We have seen public reporting and heard from whistleblowers
concerned about how ICE private contractors are managing this
situation.
I ask for unanimous consent to enter into the record a letter from
the Government Accountability Project, which represents multiple
whistleblowers who are alarmed by LaSalle Corrections' operations at
the Richwood Correctional Center in Louisiana. The Government
Accountability Project also represents subject-matter experts who were
employed by DHS to advise on detention health issues but whose input
seems to have been ignored. The letter describes extremely concerning
mismanagement that no doubt has made the crisis unfolding in ICE
detention facilities that much worse. This is not the end of this
committee's oversight of conditions at ICE detention facilities during
COVID-19.
Even before the pandemic, the committee was actively examining
persistent problems at these facilities. That work will continue. Today
I urge each one of ICE's detention contractors to be more aggressive in
their response to COVID-19.
I also hope that as the tragic public health crisis continues that
ICE will use its discretion and maximize the use of the Alternatives to
Detention Program, which the GEO Group has managed for years, to limit
the spread of COVID-19 in detention. I urge our witnesses to re-examine
how they have approached the problem of COVID-19 within their
facilities and to continue their engagement with us to improve these
conditions.

Miss Rice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
The Chair now recognizes the Ranking Member of the full
committee, the gentleman from Alabama, Mr. Rogers, for an
opening statement.
Mr. Ranking Member, you need to unmute.
Mr. Rogers. How is that?
Thank you, Madam Chairman. I want to thank Chairman
Thompson again for the use of the committee room.
During this Congress the Majority has made it a habit of
declining to invite or refusing to accommodate critical
Government fact witnesses. Today is no different. We reached
out to DHS to find out why they weren't here, and they said
they didn't know about the hearing until we called them last
week.
Now, the Majority failed to invite ICE to answer questions
about its detention policies. I am increasingly concerned that
this is a concerted tactic to avoid having experienced senior
officials from DHS at our hearings to counteract increasingly
left-wing narratives.
On the subject of today's hearing, I remind the Majority
that just last year they called the migrant surge at the border
a fake emergency, even as the crisis reached its peak. On the
subject House Democrats waited more than a year-and-a-half to
vote on a much-needed emergency funding for the border crisis,
and what they did send came up short. Not one single dollar for
Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention capacity was
included.
ICE requested over $300 million to modernize and improve
its detention and capacity to meet the spike in demand, and the
Majority didn't send a dime. Meanwhile, Customs and Border
Protection was forced to release migrants straight into border
communities. Is it the goal of the Majority? I don't know.
It is becoming increasingly clear that calls for open
borders are seeping into the mainstream Democratic Party
platform. Contractors, like the ones before us today, have
helped meet the Government's detention needs. They are often
derided for simply partnering with the Federal Government to
carry out the laws of this land. These contracts have existed
under both Democrat and Republican administrations.
During the COVID-19 crisis, ICE and its detention partners
have worked together to reduce the number of individuals in
custody. They have taken measures that go beyond CDC guidance
to adapt to the new safety protocols and cleaning procedures.
They have also provided safe accommodations for those with
final removal orders or criminal convictions whose release
would endanger our communities.
The border crisis and COVID-19 crisis are two sides of the
same coin. I question how the Majority can continue to neglect
its duty to fund ICE last year and again this year. The border
crisis and its lack of funding foreshadows the COVID-19 health
crisis. Willfully underfunding ICE to make a political point to
the base of the Democrat Party will have profound impacts on
migrants drawn here by our broken immigration systems.
Failing to invest in agencies that enforce our immigration
laws has broad consequences. I hope the Majority will
ultimately realize their continued efforts to defund ICE have
lasting consequences before we have a repeat of this hearing
again next year.
Thank you. With that, Madam Chairman, I yield back.
[The statement of Ranking Member Rogers follows:]
Statement of Ranking Member Mike Rogers

Thank you, Madam Chair.
I want to thank Chairman Thompson for the use of the committee
room.
We wish all Members were here with us today.

have worked together to reduce the number of individuals in custody.
They have taken measures that go beyond CDC guidance to adapt to
new safety protocols and cleaning procedures.
They've also provided safe accommodations for those with final
removal orders or criminal convictions whose release would endanger our
communities.
The border crisis and the COVID-19 crisis are two sides of the same
coin.
I question how the Majority can neglect its duty to fund ICE last
year and again this year.
The border crisis and its lack of funding foreshadows the COVID-19
health crisis.
Willfully underfunding ICE to make a political point to the base of
the Democratic party will have profound impacts on migrants drawn here
by our broken immigration system.
Failing to invest in agencies that enforce our immigration laws has
broad consequences.
I hope the Majority finally realizes their continued efforts to
defund ICE have lasting consequences before we have to repeat this
hearing again during the next crisis.
Thank you, I yield back.

Miss Rice. Thank you, Mr. Rogers.
I will now welcome our panel of witnesses.
Our first witness is Mr. Damon Hininger, the president and
chief executive officer of CoreCivic. Mr. Hininger joined the
company in 1992 as a correctional officer based in Kansas and

STATEMENT OF DAMON T. HININGER, PRESIDENT AND CEO, CORECIVIC

Mr. Hininger. Thank you and good afternoon. Chairwoman
Rice, Ranking Member Higgins, and Members of the subcommittee,
my name is Damon Hininger, and I am the president and CEO of
CoreCivic.
For over 35 years, CoreCivic has worked with our Federal
and State partners to provide safe, respectful, and humane
environments for those individuals housed at our facilities. I
have been with the company for more than 28 years. I began my
career as a correctional officer with the company in
Leavenworth, Kansas, where I was born and raised.
After starting as a correctional officer, I have worked in
nearly all areas of corrections. My experience in our
facilities informs my actions every day. At CoreCivic we take
seriously our responsibility to ensure that people entrusted to
our care are safe and treated in a humane manner.
The COVID-19 global pandemic is an unprecedented situation
that has presented challenges to every corrections system in
America, public or private, just as it has for other
organizations such as hospitals and nursing homes where
individuals are housed together or share common accommodations.
During this time, our No. 1 priority is the health and
safety of those entrusted to our care, our employees, and our
communities. Throughout the company's history, we have
implemented industry best practices to handle the potential
spread of infectious diseases.
Since the pandemic began, we have worked quickly to execute
the guidance of the CDC and our partners. I believe these
practices and the measures CoreCivic has implemented in our
facilities have prevented further transmission of COVID-19.
Beginning in February, we started monitoring the
development of COVID-19 nationally and in our facilities. In
March, we activated our emergency operations center, or EOC,
which functions 24 hours a days, 7 days a week.
The EOC serves as a central point to help coordinate our
response and support our facilities. Coordination and
communication across the company has been critical, and the
guidance from the CDC and our partners has evolved over time as
we have learned more about COVID-19.
We also formed a COVID-19 task force comprised of senior
operations and medical leaders to monitor the pandemic and
develop facilities-specific response and medical action plans.
We quickly pushed out guidance on good hygiene practices. At
our facilities our staff works constantly to educate those in
our care about how to combat the spread of COVID-19.
Consistent with the CDC's recommendations, our staff are
required to wear masks, and we provide masks to both our staff
and detainees in our ICE facilities. These masks are replaced
as necessary, and we have an adequate supply of masks stocked
at our facilities.
CoreCivic also screens all individuals and employees before
entry to our facilities. These screenings include temperature
and COVID-19 symptom checks.
The realities of the pandemic have required us to make
certain operational changes at our facilities. For example,
working closely with our Government partners, we suspended in-
person visitation in March. Following the guidance of the CDC
and ICE, CoreCivic separately houses from the general
population any detainee who tests positive for COVID-19 or who
is exposed to a positive case.
We have also adjusted how we serve meals and provide other
services to promote social distancing and reduce the risk of
transmission. Our staff understands that while these steps are
necessary to stop the spread of the virus, these changes can be
stressful to the detainees and their families.
To address this, we have provided additional virtual
communication through phones and other means, including adding
additional free call minutes. Where it is safe to do so, we
have preserved detainee activities. We hold town hall meetings
to share information with detainees, answer their questions,
and listen to their concerns. CoreCivic's website has a
dedicated section for families with information about CDC
guidance and visitation.
The health and well-being of our nearly 14,000 CoreCivic
employees is a top priority. We recognize that reporting to
work during a global pandemic can be stressful for our
employees. We expanded paid leave to those who have to miss
work for COVID-19-related reasons.
We offer accommodations to employees who may face an
elevated risk of complications from COVID-19 and wish to take
extended leave.
To recognize CoreCivic employees' service during the
pandemic, each facility employee, including part-time
employees, received a $500 hero bonus and additional time off.
COVID-19 continues to threaten our Nation and affect
Americans in every region and working in every industry. We
continue to work every day to reduce the risk of transmission,
care for those who live and work in our facilities, and make
every effort to improve our practices and procedures.
I thank you for the opportunity to testify today and look
forward to your questions.

Prepared Statement of Damon T. Hininger
July 13, 2020
Chairwoman Rice, Ranking Member Higgins, and Members of the
subcommittee, my name is Damon Hininger, and I am the president and
chief executive officer of CoreCivic, Inc. For over 35 years, CoreCivic
has worked with our Federal and State partners to provide safe,
respectful, and humane environments for those individuals housed at our
facilities. I have been with the company for more than 27 years; I
began my career as a correctional officer with the company in
Leavenworth, Kansas, which is where I was born and raised. I have
worked in nearly all areas of corrections, including in the commissary,
the laundry room, compliance, transportation services, and as a
training manager.
My experience in our facilities informs my actions every day. At
CoreCivic, we all take seriously our responsibility to ensure the
people entrusted to our care are safe and treated in a humane manner.
I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the work CoreCivic performs
in partnership with its Federal, State, and local partners and how our
company has responded to the COVID-19 global pandemic. The COVID-19
global pandemic is an unprecedented situation that has presented
challenges to our company just as it has for other organizations, such
as hospitals and nursing homes, where individuals are housed together
or share accommodations. Despite these challenges, I believe the
measures CoreCivic has implemented in our facilities have prevented
further transmission of COVID-19.
about corecivic
CoreCivic was established in 1983 to help address critical problems
in United States correctional institutions. Since its founding, the
company has provided correction and detention management services to
local, State, and Federal facilities, including the Federal Bureau of
Prisons (``BOP''), the United States Marshals Service (``USMS''), and
United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (``ICE'') (and its
predecessor agencies). In addition to providing fundamental residential
services, CoreCivic's correctional, detention, and reentry facilities
offer a variety of rehabilitation and educational programs, including
basic education, faith-based services, life skills and employment
training, and substance abuse treatment. We currently operate 50
correctional and detention facilities, 43 of which we own and manage
and 7 of which we manage but are owned by our Government partners. With
respect to ICE, we currently operate 16 detention centers.
I am proud of the hard work of our nearly 14,000 employees across
23 States to ensure proper, respectful treatment for the people
entrusted to our care. Their job is difficult and challenging. Often,
individuals placed in our care have just completed an arduous,
emotional, and physically draining journey. They arrive with little--
and frequently without any records or documented medical history. In
response, our staff works tirelessly to provide them with safe
quarters, medical assistance, appropriate food, and overall support.
After accepting these individuals into our care, our staff provides a
number of services and programing opportunities. Each year, individuals
at CoreCivic facilities across the country earn High School Equivalency
Certificates, achieve trade certifications for professions, engage in
religious services, obtain pro bono legal representation, receive
medical care, and undergo addiction treatment and mental health
counseling.
Each CoreCivic facility adheres to a detailed set of Government-
mandated standards and CoreCivic has a strong compliance history and
commitment to transparency. We invest a substantial amount each year in
perfecting our compliance and quality assurance efforts, including our
pre-employment training and routine, annual training for our nearly
14,000 employees. CoreCivic is subject to inspections and oversight
from a number of parties, as required by our contracts. All audits,
whether they be by Federal agencies, local government departments, or
third-party accreditors, add a unique level of scrutiny and complexity.
At ICE facilities, for example, our employees are in frequent contact
with ICE personnel. ICE has unimpeded access to review and monitor our
compliance and has personnel on-site in our facilities.
On top of these efforts, we operate our own Quality Assurance
program where we audit and assess our performance and compliance with
our contracts. Each facility has at least 1 full-time Quality Assurance
Manager whose job it is to assess compliance with the contracts and
accreditation standards. The inspection team for CoreCivic not only
evaluates for compliance with ICE detention standards but also
CoreCivic's own policies and procedures. We have a long history of
unannounced Quality Assurance visits to our facilities, and we have
continuously worked to enhance and improve our internal inspections
program. We are not perfect every day, but we make every effort to
correct any problems. I take very seriously my responsibility to make
sure that our facilities are safe, compliant, and frequently monitored.
response to the covid-19 global pandemic
COVID-19 has created extraordinary challenges for every corrections
and detention system in America, public and private. CoreCivic has
worked closely with its Government partners, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (``CDC''), and State health officials to respond
to this unprecedented situation appropriately and thoroughly for our
staff, the well-being of those entrusted to our care, and our
communities.
Preventing and addressing infectious diseases to protect the health
and safety of those who reside and work at CoreCivic facilities has
long been a part of correctional facility operations. At ICE facilities
in particular, CoreCivic staff has experience managing and treating
communicable diseases, as the populations in these facilities typically
have not received the kind of medical care and vaccinations that we
have in the United States, and are therefore at greater risk of
carrying certain infectious diseases. CoreCivic is required to adhere
to applicable standards established by ICE and other CoreCivic partners
to respond to the threat of infectious disease at CoreCivic facilities.
These standards, which CoreCivic implements and is audited against by
its Government partners, have formed the basis for CoreCivic's
preparation and management of the COVID-19 global pandemic. For
example, the Performance-Based National Detention Standards 2011
(Revised December 2016) (``PBNDS'') Part 4.3(II)(10) mandates that CDC
guidelines be followed to prevent and control the spread of infectious
and communicable diseases. Part 4.3(V)(C) requires that facilities have
infection control plans that address the management of infectious and
communicable diseases, including procedures for ``screening,
prevention, education, identification, monitoring and surveillance,
immunization (when applicable), treatment, follow-up, [and] isolation
(when indicated) . . . .'' When necessary, these plans provide for
reporting to the appropriate Government agencies.
In addition to following these and other standards, CoreCivic has
taken numerous company-wide steps in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In February, CoreCivic began monitoring the development of COVID-19,
both Nationally and throughout its facilities. On March 18, we
activated our Emergency Operation Center (``EOC''), functioning 24
hours a day, 7 days a week, from our Facility Support Center (corporate
headquarters), to assist our facility leadership team in managing
COVID-19. Our EOC, which uses software employed by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency for emergency response, serves as a central
point to identify and direct resources needed, such as Personal
Protective Equipment (``PPE''), tracks and analyzes cases, holds
regular conference calls with our facilities, and collects and shares
data to assist in making informed decisions. The role of the EOC in
coordinating the response to the pandemic by our facilities has been
particularly important as the CDC guidance and recommendations, as well
as the recommendations of our partners, have evolved over time and as
we have learned more about COVID-19.
Consistent with the recommendations of the CDC and following the
guidance of our Government partners, including the ICE COVID-19
Pandemic Response Requirements, CoreCivic also has implemented measures
to combat the spread of COVID-19 in our facilities. We have distributed
signage, posters, and educational packets to facility staff to inform
them and the detainees about the symptoms of the disease and promote
enhanced hygiene practices to prevent its transmission. Our staff
actively encourages these best practices, including social distancing
when possible, regular handwashing, respiratory etiquette (coughing or
sneezing into a sleeve or tissue), and avoiding touching one's face.
The company also provides masks to detainees in our ICE facilities and
includes instruction on how to wear them properly in order to reduce
the chance of transmission. Masks are replaced as necessary. CoreCivic
regularly provides soap to detainees free of charge, and replenishes
soap as needed and upon request. In the event of any positive cases,
CoreCivic separates detainees who test positive for COVID-19 from the
general population. Detainees who test positive are isolated or housed
with other detainees who have tested positive. Detainees exposed to a
positive case are quarantined with other detainees who have also been
exposed and are monitored for any symptoms. CoreCivic also adjusts meal
schedules and services to promote social distancing and, if necessary,
delivers meals to detainees to reduce contacts that may lead to COVID-
19 transmission.
In addition to educating staff and those in our care about hygiene
practices, CoreCivic screens all employees before entry to prevent the
spread of COVID-19. These screenings include temperature checks and
questions designed to identify possible COVID-19 symptoms or potential
exposure. If a staff member exhibits symptoms of, or indicates exposure
to, COVID-19 during the screening, a human resources (``HR'')
representative is notified, and the staff member is designated for a
necessary leave of absence. In addition to these screenings, if an
employee calls out sick with COVID-19-like symptoms, H.R. managers will
contact the employee telephonically to discuss the employee's symptoms
to determine whether the employee should refrain from returning to work
until he or she has recovered or is determined not to have contracted
COVID-19. By taking these precautions with staff before they enter the
facilities, and sending home those with symptoms of or likely exposure
to COVID-19, CoreCivic aims to prevent situations where staff who are
symptomatic, or believe they have been exposed to COVID-19, enter its
facilities and risk infecting other employees or detainees. The company
requests that employees who test positive for COVID-19 or who
experience COVID-19 symptoms inform their supervisors and H.R. managers
and refrain from returning to work until the appropriate time following
the guidance of a health care professional.
With respect to medical care, the ICE Health Service Corps is
responsible for providing at 6 of CoreCivic's ICE facilities;\1\ at the
remainder, CoreCivic is responsible for providing medical care.
CoreCivic has drafted and implemented a Coronavirus Plan for each
facility, procured COVID-19 test kits, and strengthened the medical
intake process to identify those at high risk of contracting COVID-19.
As recommended by the CDC, CoreCivic provides medical staff who are
treating patients infected with COVID-19 with PPE, including N95
respirators, face shields, gloves, and gowns. Within the facilities we
operate on behalf of ICE, CoreCivic or ICE Health Service Corps staff
are responsible for caring for detainees diagnosed with COVID-19; in
the event that hospital care is indicated, CoreCivic arranges transport
for those detainees to a medical facility for further treatment or
calls an ambulance.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ The ICE Health Service Corps provides medical care at the
Elizabeth Detention Center, Eloy Detention Center, Houston Processing
Center, T. Don Hutto Residential Center, Otay Mesa Detention Center,
and South Texas Family Residential Center.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The health and well-being of the nearly 14,000 CoreCivic employees
is a top priority. We recognize that reporting to work during the
global pandemic can be stressful for our employees and we have taken a
number of steps to protect their health and support them during this
uncertain time. Early in our response, CoreCivic suspended all non-
essential business travel, shared guidance with employees regarding
COVID-19, and distributed information to the families of our employees.
To accommodate employees during this time, CoreCivic expanded its paid
leave policies to employees who have to miss work for COVID-19-related
reasons. CoreCivic also makes accommodations for employees who may face
an elevated risk of complications from COVID-19 and employees who wish
to take extended leave for COVID-19-related reasons. To recognize
CoreCivic employees' service and dedication during this unprecedented
time, CoreCivic has provided every CoreCivic facility employee,
including part-time employees, with a $500 ``Hero Bonus'' and
additional time off in recognition of their efforts to respond to
COVID-19. In addition, CoreCivic distributes masks to employees and
mandates their use when inside a facility to protect themselves and the
health and safety of those entrusted to our care.
In addition to our efforts to promote the well-being of our
employees, we understand that the individuals placed in our care and
their families are concerned about the spread of COVID-19. The pandemic
has presented detainees and their families, like much of the world,
with unprecedented circumstances. Detainee health and safety is our top
priority, and CoreCivic suspended visitation in order to reduce the
risk that COVID-19 may enter CoreCivic facilities. While we recognize
this deprives detainees of crucial social and familial interaction, we
have aimed to facilitate additional virtual communication through
phones and other means. In addition, CoreCivic has worked with our
partners to provide additional free call minutes, and has scheduled
video sessions for detainees and their counsel in many facilities.
CoreCivic facilities have also taken steps on a facility-by-facility
basis to preserve activities for detainees in a safe manner. We have
also held numerous town halls to convey information to detainees and
listen to their concerns. CoreCivic's website has a dedicated section
for the families of those in our care to visit to, among other things,
provide resources, answer frequently asked questions, convey CDC
guidance, and deliver updates on visitation changes.
Throughout this time, CoreCivic has continued to prioritize
compliance and monitor its facilities. While the company is not able to
conduct on-site inspections of all its facilities as it did before the
pandemic, we believe that continued internal audits and inspections are
critical to our ability to maintain compliance and meet our partners'
requirements. We have continued to provide technical assistance to our
facilities and adjusted our Quality Assurance practices to carry out
certain monitoring and auditing functions remotely. Our senior
operations managers and executive team have continued to visit our
facilities during the pandemic to ensure compliance with COVID-related
guidance.
conclusion
COVID-19 continues to threaten our Nation and affect more and more
Americans in every region and working in every industry. The inherent
nature of our work means thousands of CoreCivic employees are on those
front lines every day. I am immensely proud of our CoreCivic staff who
work daily to protect and care for those in our facilities. The
challenges we have faced have been unprecedented and our company has
worked continuously to respond to the requirements of our partners and
adjust our operations as we learn more information about the virus. I
believe CoreCivic's efforts and the steps we have implemented have
helped to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, and we will continue to
do all we can to protect our staff and those entrusted to our care.

Miss Rice. Thank you. Thank you for your testimony.
I now recognize Mr. Zoley to summarize his statement for 5
minutes.

STATEMENT OF GEORGE C. ZOLEY, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, THE GEO GROUP

Mr. Zoley. Chairman Thompson, Chairwoman Rice, Ranking
Member Rogers, Ranking Member Higgins, and distinguished
Members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to
testify.
I was born in 1950 in Florina, Greece, located on the
northwestern border of the country in a house with no plumbing
or electricity. Also in the house where I was born were Greek
soldiers who were spending the night resting from fighting
communist partisans from Yugoslavia and Albania.
Fortunately, in 1953 my family received approval to
immigrate to the United States where we traveled by ship
landing in New York City and where we were processed through
Ellis Island. We settled in Akron, Ohio, where I learned to
speak English and began my education that eventually took me to
Kent State University in 1968 and 1969.
My own immigrant story has shaped the core values that have
guided my entire life and career, which include the principle
of never placing profit above the value of people.
I am chairman and CEO and founder of the GEO Group which I
established 1984. Four of our 9 board of directors are either
female or members of a minority group. We have 23,000 employees
in locations in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia,
and South Africa.
Sixty percent of our employees are members of a minority
groups reflecting our company's diversity. Ninety-three percent
of our employees who work in our secure services division earn
$15 an hour or more.
Now I would like to address some things that our company
does not do. We don't manage any shelters or facilities for
unaccompanied minors. We don't manage any facilities with chain
link fencing in housing areas. We don't play a role in who is
assigned to a facility under our management. We don't lobby for
stricter criminal justice or immigration laws.
In my written submission, I have chronicled the numerous
company steps taken to fight COVID-19 virus, but here I will
only summarize our response. We believe we have acted quickly
and effectively to protect the health of those in our care and
our employees.
I am pleased to report that there have been zero COVID-19
deaths in GEO-managed facilities for ICE. Further, there is
only 1 detainee and 1 employee who are presently hospitalized.
In early February, we began posting information throughout
our facilities on the importance of social distancing, proper
hand washing, and sanitation practices. COVID-19-specific
cleaning supplies and hygiene products have been continuously
available at all housing units. All detainees and employees are
supplied with masks.
High-risk residents are identified and placed in separate
housing units with specialized health care protocols. Improved
social distancing has been made possible to our ICE facilities
operating at less than 50 percent occupancy.
We have an on-going COVID-19 testing program for residents
and employees which will expand in September when we expect to
receive 45 Abbott COVID-19 test machines. We will continue to
apply best practices to improve our effectiveness in fighting
this virus.
This concludes my opening remarks. I appreciate the
opportunity.

Prepared Statement of George C. Zoley
July 13, 2020
i. introduction
Chairman Thompson, Chairwoman Rice, Ranking Member Rogers, Ranking
Member Higgins, and distinguished Members of the subcommittee, thank
you for the opportunity to testify.
My name is George Zoley and I am the founder, chairman, and chief
executive officer of The GEO Group (or GEO), established in 1984.
It is an honor to appear before you today to tell you about the
heroic efforts of our front-line employees who have courageously fought
the coronavirus (COVID-19) head-on to ensure those entrusted to our
care are safe, protected, and provided access to medical care to
minimize the spread of this virus and improve the prospects of
recovery.
I want to thank those employees and their families for all they do
day-in and day-out in support of our client's mission, their community,
and our country.
This statement addresses 5 main topics:
First, I provide information about the history of our company and
address our values, accountability, varied work, and successful
initiatives.
Second, I describe how GEO's health care services are structured
and managed. This strong foundation has enabled the company to respond
quickly to the significant challenges posed by COVID-19.
Third, I outline the exhaustive steps that we have been taking
since January 2020 to fight COVID-19. This work includes developing
plans, policies, and guidance in accordance with the guidelines of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. Immigration
and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and other relevant authorities;
educating and raising awareness among detainees and staff about the
spread and prevention of COVID-19; providing personal protective
equipment (PPE) to staff and detainees, along with training about PPE
use; implementing separation protocols, initiating screening for COVID-
19 symptoms; and managing COVID-19 testing.
Fourth, in accordance with our commitment to transparency, I
provide select COVID-19 statistics for our ICE facilities.
Finally, I highlight the strong diversity of our company.
ii. geo history
For more than 30 years, The GEO Group has been a trusted service
provider to Federal, State, and local government agencies in the United
States. We deliver quality management and care for secure institutions,
ICE processing centers, and community reentry facilities. We also
create and provide technology that supports alternatives to detention.
Over the years, our company has evolved to become a leading
provider of offender rehabilitation, post-release services, and
community-based programs. Our 3-decade long journey has been driven by
a daily pursuit of operational excellence across all our service lines.
We recognize that pursuing excellence requires frequent
introspection and a commitment to taking steps to improve upon what we
do every day. This commitment led us to invest in a regional operating
structure approximately 2 decades ago, bringing the daily oversight of
our facilities closer to our clients, and ensuring that we are able to
respond as quickly as possible to any challenges that may arise in the
delivery of our services. Today, our 3 regional offices are comprised
of numerous subject-matter experts who provide direct oversight for our
secure facilities across the United States.
Our commitment to continuous improvement and accountability also
led us to pursue third-party accreditation for all our U.S. secure
facilities, and in many instances above and beyond our contractual
requirements, as well as, all applicable non-secure community reentry
facilities. This independent accreditation is based on standards set by
leading organizations such as the American Correctional Association,
the National Commission on Correctional Health Care, and The Joint
Commission, among other entities. Today, all, but our 6 newest, U.S.
secure facilities are accredited by the American Correctional
Association, with an average accreditation score of 99.6 percent.
We are particularly proud of our commitment to improve the lives of
those entrusted to our care in State correctional facilities by
providing rehabilitation and reentry programs that can reduce
recidivism, prepare individuals to contribute to our Nation's
workforce, and help them reintegrate into society. Our GEO Continuum of
Care (CoC) integrates enhanced offender rehabilitation, including
cognitive behavioral treatment, with post-release support services to
address basic community needs, including housing, transportation, food,
clothing, and job placement assistance. This innovative program began
as a pilot at one GEO facility in 2015 and received the ``Innovation in
Corrections'' award from the American Correctional Association just 3
years later in 2018.
GEO's 2020 annual funding commitment in support of the CoC program
at 19 facilities, is approximately $13.5 million, representing
approximately 10 percent of GEO's net income. The implementation of our
GEO Continuum of Care has led to an increase in the number of GED/High
School Equivalency degrees, vocational training certifications, and
substance abuse treatment completions awarded annually throughout our
facilities. These efforts reflect our company's aspiration to
continually improve our services.
Contrary to what has been reported by the media, individuals, and
groups who oppose the private sector's role in providing services to
ICE, we have never managed any shelters or facilities housing
unaccompanied minors. We do not manage any Border Patrol holding
facilities along the U.S. Southwest Border. We do not manage any
facilities with tent structures or chain-link fencing in housing areas,
and we do not play a role in advocating for, or against, criminal
justice or immigration laws. As a company, we will never take part in
any of these activities.
iii. geo services provided to ice
We respect the right of all persons to have a safe and humane
living environment, and our commitment to this right is unwavering.
This commitment calls for us to follow many sets of client standards
that define and proscribe the daily operation of our facilities and
programs. We think it is important to point out the difference in
staffing for immigration detention at GEO's ICE processing centers,
versus that of GEO's State correctional facilities that we operate on
behalf of criminal justice agencies. The additional staffing at GEO's
ICE processing centers is necessary to comply with the immigration
detention standards that were heavily revised under President Obama's
administration and that remain in effect.
Overall facility staffing at GEO's ICE processing centers is
approximately 30 percent more than that of GEO's State correctional
facilities. This difference is the result of the numerous requirements
from ICE, versus the requirements from our State partners. ICE requires
the additional staffing to provide more services and transportation
support for ICE detainees. Health care staffing at GEO's ICE processing
centers is approximately 117 percent more than that of GEO's State
correctional facilities. The additional health care staffing is
required by ICE to provide a high-level of treatment for detainees who
have numerous health and mental health needs due to arriving from
countries with limited health care services. GEO is also implementing
electronic health records and virtual visits, with medical and mental
health providers, to further improve its health care services to ICE.
The health care needs of the individuals in our care are often
significant. Those needs can include acute or chronic health care
conditions and mental health issues. However, according to statistics
from the U.S. Department of Justice, the mortality rate in State
correctional facilities averages 256 per 100,000 inmates. In the
Federal prison system, the average mortality rate is 225 per 100,000
inmates. By comparison, the mortality rate at ICE processing centers is
significantly lower at less than 3 per 100,000 detainees.
Under the programmatic supervision of ICE's Immigration Health
Services Corps (IHSC), GEO staff are often responsible for the health
care at our facilities. In other locations, we subcontract with a
health care company to provide medical care to ICE detainees.
GEO health care services are under the oversight of the GEO Health
Care Division located in our corporate headquarters in Boca Raton,
Florida. The division is led by a chief medical officer with 4 decades
of experience in clinical medicine. He is supported by 12 subject-
matter experts in correctional health care, dental services, mental
health services, quality control, administration, and off-site health
care claims management, as well as clinical care support.
Our Healthcare Division monitors staff vacancies, clinical
outcomes, special incidents, clinical encounters, outside patient care,
medication management, and updates to clinical guidelines. For all
facilities at which GEO itself provides health care services, local
oversight and support is provided through one of GEO's 3 regional
offices, located in Charlotte, North Carolina; San Antonio, Texas; and
Los Angeles, California.
Each regional office has a regional director of correctional health
services, and each regional director is supported by up to 3 regional
managers of correctional health services. GEO strives to ensure that
health care staff, including medical, nursing, dental, and mental
health professionals, are available to every individual in our care.
The facility health care staff fulfill their clinical and
administrative responsibilities by working with our security staff, to
address any health situation that may arise. Our security staff are
also trained to manage an urgent/emergent health situation when health
care staff may not be immediately available, in accordance with GEO's
policies and well-defined procedures. Initial screening for medical,
mental health, and dental care is to be completed as soon as possible
after intake, and generally within 12 hours of reception at our
facilities. Those who are identified as most seriously ill are
prioritized for immediate clinical evaluation.
As required by ICE's detention standards, we provide full health
care exams to be conducted by a qualified physician, nurse
practitioner, physician assistant, or registered nurse within 14-
calendar days following admission. Based on the results of the full
medical examination, diagnostic and therapeutic plans for any
identified conditions are developed.
All individuals in our care have coordinated 24/7 access to health
care services. They are given the opportunity to submit oral or written
health care requests at any time. These requests are then picked up
each day by health care staff and are reviewed and prioritized by
qualified health care professionals.
All individuals in our care have the right to refuse or question
the health care they are receiving through an established grievance
process. This process is an important component of our Quality
Improvement program. Once a grievance has been submitted and reviewed,
the issues raised are evaluated and immediate corrective action is
taken if warranted. Face-to-face interviews are often recommended, so
problems can be resolved effectively and promptly. The grievance
process is carefully explained to all individuals in our care.
Suicide risk assessment and prevention is an important objective of
ICE's detention standards. Accordingly, our suicide prevention program
is clearly defined in policies and procedures, and serves to minimize
the occurrence of a suicide by reducing risk and self-destructive
individual behaviors. We take our responsibility to provide prompt and
comprehensive health and mental health care to everyone in our care
seriously, as evidenced by the policies, practices, and professional
guidelines we follow in our facilities. Professional guidelines include
those established by the American Correctional Association, the
National Commission on Correctional Health Care, and the Joint
Commission.
iv. geo's response to covid-19
Based upon existing infectious and communicable disease protocols,
in mid-January 2020 the GEO Group (GEO) began its expansive planning
processes to ensure we were taking a proactive approach to properly
prepare for the potential spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
in our facilities. The GEO Group initiated a multidisciplinary Incident
Command-type posture from our Corporate Headquarters to promote and
sustain awareness and readiness to fight the COVID-19 Virus. The
following bullets highlight our actions:

In February GEO focused heavily on an ``Awareness &
Educational'' campaign, providing ever-changing updates from
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to all
facilities which highlighted the importance of social
distancing, proper handwashing, and sanitation practices. This
information was posted throughout our facilities to include
staff work areas and detainee living areas.

GEO continuously played educational videos on big screen TVs
in detainee living areas at all GEO facilities. Additionally,
leadership staff conducted frequent educational town hall
meetings with all detainees using translation services and
provided continued staff education daily at shift briefings as
well as all meetings with staff.

Even before CDC guidance was issued, GEO took significant
steps to prevent the spread of the virus.

In February, GEO's chief medical officer provided
comprehensive technical guidance in a policy titled Coronavirus
(COVID-19) Management that outlined the treatment and
containment approach for COVID-19 based on the latest
information provided by the CDC.

GEO's corporate operations and medical staff developed the
framework for a Unified Pandemic Plan specific to COVID-19 to
promote consistency in our responses company-wide.

On February 26, 2020, GEO's chief medical officer issued a
Memorandum advising field staff of forthcoming COVID-19
Guidance and Emergency Plans to be utilized for the screening
and prevention of COVID-19. The Memorandum also included
informational materials from the Center of Disease Control
(CDC) to be posted throughout the facilities.

On February 27, 2020, updated health care policies were
shared with all GEO facility health service administrators.

On February 28, 2020, the COVID-19 Emergency Response Plan
was disseminated to all facility administrators who implemented
it by March 6 and immediately began ``table-top'' emergency
preparedness exercises, even before there was a pandemic
declaration.

GEO began temperature screening of all new arrivals in the
sally ports before they entered the facility. If an
individual's temperature exceeded 100 degrees, he or she was
placed in medical isolation and referred for additional medical
attention.

In early March 2020, GEO's chief medical officer opened up a
robust dialog with the leadership of ICE's Immigration Health
Services Corps (IHSC) on how to best respond to COVID-19.

To promote containment, in early March, GEO began
encouraging our clients to suspend social visiting to mitigate
outside exposure to the individuals entrusted in our care. As
of March 13, 2020, all clients had suspended social visiting.

In March 2020, all staff and visitors entering facilities
were required to complete a COVID-19 screening questionnaire
and submit to a forehead temperature check prior to being
admitted into a facility.

In March 2020, GEO implemented modified detainee movement in
all facilities to assist in isolating and containing any
potential exposure.

On March 13, 2020, a COVID-19 monitoring process was
implemented to track critical data points.

On March 20, 2020, daily command center COVID-19 meetings
were initiated from our corporate office with GEO's 3 regional
offices.

On March 23, 2020, the CDC issued initial interim guidance
specific to Corrections and Detention entitled ``Interim
Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-
19)''.

In March 2020, GEO issued guidance directing staff with a
high risk of exposure to an infected or likely infected
detainee to wear the following PPE:

Nitrile disposable gloves

N95 disposable filtration respirator

Disposable gown

Eye protection/face shield.

In March 2020, COVID-19 information was posted in vital
areas of our facilities, such as the front entrance, visiting
areas, restrooms, health services unit, housing units,
Restrictive Housing Unit, and staff break rooms. Facilities
ensured that detainees remained informed via town hall meetings
and staff were informed by using the following venues to
emphasize the important role of prevention: Shift briefings,
meetings with staff and department heads.

In March 2020, the chief medical officer and executive VP,
human resources, promulgated guidance regarding how employees
should return to work and the approval procedures required for
employees who had previously tested positive for COVID-19.

In March 2020, we increased our supply of food at each
facility to an 8-week supply. We also created an option to
extend that supply to add an additional 3 months.

In March 2020, the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration suspended, temporarily the requirement for
annual N95 respirator fit testing due to the global shortage of
N95 respirators.

In March, Corporate Health Services began publishing a
periodic STOP COVID-19 newsletter to facilities administrators,
health services administrators, and GEO's leadership to provide
educational information and to enhance communication efforts
for the safety and well-being of the facility staff and
population.

As a company, we ensured staff received proper training on
the use of PPE and in early April, consistent the CDC's updated
guidance, GEO provided surgical masks to all staff, who were
strongly encouraged to use them.

On April 6, 2020, Chief United States District Judge Ricardo
S. Martinez stated in a court ruling that ``there is
substantial evidence before the court of robust measures at the
Northwest [ICE] Detention Center to prevent an outbreak of
COVID-19, to contain one should it occur, and generally to
provide for the safety of the detainees housed there during the
pandemic.'' Judge Martinez noted that ``the measures
implemented by the NWDC generally track the recommendation of
the DHS's medical subject-matter experts.''

On April 10, 2020, GEO complied with the ICE/ERO Directive
regarding COVID-19 Pandemic Response Requirements, which
included reducing populations to approximately 75 percent to
promote better social distancing.

In April 2020, PPE (face masks, eye protection, and gloves)
were issued to all staff. In addition, all detainees were
issued face masks in enough quantities to replace used masks 3
times per week. To ensure proper care and usage of PPE,
training was provided to all staff and detainees.

Also in April, we began identifying high-risk detainees,
placing them in separate housing groups, and establishing
additional protocols for temperature testing and more frequent
access to the health care unit.

On May 4, 2020, intake testing was initiated at the
Alexandria Transfer Center in Louisiana for those identified
countries requiring the testing for COVID-19.

On May 5, 2020, at ICE's request, the Joe Corley and Karnes
Family Residential facilities started to use an Abbott COVID
testing device on detainee/residents who ICE was planning to
remove.

On May 21, 2020, a representative from the Florida
Department of Health visited the Broward ICE facility due to
the ``spike'' of positive COVID-19 cases as reported in the
local media. She expressed how impressed she was with the
obvious efforts staff had made to address the COVID-19 crisis
and preventive measures to prevent its spread inside the
institution.

Since May 27, 2020, all new persons arriving at the Adelanto
ICE Processing Center are administered a COVID-19 test upon
arrival and housed separately from general population detainees
until cleared by medical staff.

On June 2, 2020, the Aurora ICE Processing Center initiated
saturation COVID-19 testing of all detainees. The testing was
completed on June 16, 2020. The testing was conducted in
coordination with the Denver metropolitan area's Tri-County
Health Department.

June 2, 2020, the Northwest ICE Processing Center initiated
saturation COVID-19 testing of all detainees. The testing was
performed by the ICE Health Services Corps (IHSC) and was
completed in 1 day.

June 3, 2020, the Aurora ICE Processing Center commenced
voluntary COVID-19 testing of all staff. The testing was also
conducted in coordination with the Tri-County Health Department
and was completed on June 24, 2020.

June 4, 2020, all new commitments to the Northwest ICE
Processing Center are administered a COVID-19 test upon arrival
and were housed separately from general population detainees
until cleared by ICE's IHSC.

On June 4, 2020, intake testing was initiated at the
LaSalle, Louisiana ICE Processing Center, as well as, the
Montgomery Processing Center.

On June 10, 2020, the South Texas ICE Processing Center
initiated intake testing.

On June 17, 2020, the Northwest ICE Processing Center
commenced voluntary COVID-19 testing of all staff. The testing
was conducted by the Washington State Department of Health and
was completed on June 18, 2020.

On June 22, 2020, the Karnes Family Residential facility
started saturation testing of residents and staff. Testing of
residents was completed on June 22, 2020. Staff testing was
completed on June 29, 2020.

We have conducted this significant work pursuant to our
client's requirements, applicable health care guidelines, and
through the engagement of our stakeholders. For example, on
June 22, 2020, the South Texas ICE Processing Center conducted
a tour for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. In attendance
were:

Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-TX 20th District)

Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX 28th District)

Rep. Sylvia Garcia (D-TX 29th District).

On June 23, 2020, intake testing was initiated at the
Broward, Florida; Folkston, Georgia; Pine Prairie, Louisiana;
and South Louisiana ICE Processing Centers. Also, South
Louisiana initiated mass testing.

On June 25, 2020, the Montgomery Processing Center started
detainee mass testing and completed it on June 29, 2020.

On June 25, 2020, the Karnes Family Residential Center
started testing upon arrival.

On June 26, 2020, the Louisiana Department of Health,
partnering with the Louisiana National Guard, began offering
COVID testing for the Alexandria and LaSalle facility staff.
The Broward and South Louisiana facilities initiated mass staff
testing.

Beginning on June 26, 2020, all new commitments to the
Aurora ICE Processing Center are administered a COVID-19 test
upon arrival and are housed separately from general population
detainees until cleared by medical staff.

Beginning June 29, 2020, all new commitments to the Mesa
Verde ICE Processing Center are administered a COVID-19 test
upon arrival and are housed separately from general population
detainees until cleared by medical staff.
v. covid-19 statistics (geo ice facilities)

As of July 7, 2020, we have conducted 4,629 tests with the
following results: 4,018 negative results, 611 positive results
and 208 refusals, out of approximately 35,000 detainees who
either entered or departed from one of our facilities in the
last 4 months.

As of this writing, there are no ICE detainees that are
hospitalized.

As of this writing, there have been no ICE detainee deaths
from COVID-19.

As of July 7, 2020, there have been 130 confirmed COVID-19
cases among GEO's staff who work at ICE facilities. This
represents 3 percent of the GEO ICE staff, who total 3,735
employees.

There is only 1 GEO staff member from an ICE facility in the
hospital at this time.

No GEO employees who work at an ICE facility have died from
COVID-19.
vi. geo's diverse workforce
In all areas of our business, GEO has strived to achieve wider
racial, ethnic, age, and gender diversity. Across our organization,
under-represented minorities--which include African Americans, Hispanic
and Latino, Asian, Pacific Islander, Native Hawaiian and Native
American/Alaskan--currently account for 60 percent of our total U.S.
employee workforce. Women make up over half our workforce in the United
States. Minorities comprise 38 percent of GEO's corporate workforce in
the United States, 68 percent of our U.S. security staff, and 28
percent of those serving in management positions as directors or above.
GEO Group's employee population is also diverse in age. Of new hires in
2018, 37 percent were under age 30, 49 percent were between ages 30 and
50, and 27 percent were age 50 and older.
Additionally, we exceed all requirements in support of small,
disadvantaged, or minority-owned businesses in the local communities we
serve. Over 23 percent of our company's Federal subcontracting dollars
have been to these types of businesses. In 2019, GEO spent close to $79
million on supplies and services provided by small disadvantaged
businesses and women-owned businesses, an increase of approximately 12
percent from 2018.
GEO is also dedicated to employing Veterans, who comprise 11
percent of our current U.S. workforce, as well as supporting Veteran-
owned businesses for which we spent approximately $13 million on
supplies and services in 2019.
We are particularly proud that, during these difficult and
challenging times, we have maintained full employment for all of our
employees and helped support the communities in which they live and
work.
vii. summary
COVID-19 has created and continues to create an unprecedented
challenge for every citizen of our great country and we mourn for those
we have lost to the pandemic.
The GEO Group has worked very aggressively with our clients,
various health authorities and the local community to curb the spread
of the coronavirus. We continue to adapt and remain vigilant as we
learn more about this contagion. We stand steadfast and take very
seriously our responsibility to care for every person who has been
entrusted to us.
I thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today and look
forward to answering any questions you may have.

Miss Rice. Thank you, Mr. Zoley. Thank you for your
testimony.
I now recognize Mr. Marquardt to summarize his statement
for 5 minutes.

STATEMENT OF SCOTT MARQUARDT, PRESIDENT AND CEO, MANAGEMENT &
TRAINING CORPORATION (MTC)

Mr. Marquardt. Thank you for the opportunity to appear in
today's hearing. My name is Scott Marquardt, and I am the CEO
of Management and Training Corporation. I would like to share
my company's experiences responding to COVID-19 in the 5
detention facilities we operate in California, New Mexico, and
Texas.
Since the start of this pandemic, our top priority has been
to take actions that protect the detainees and our staff from
this virus. MTC began in 1981 as an operator of residential job
corps centers. We provide low-income youth with academic
instruction and technical training as well as wraparound
services, including food, shelter, medical care, mentorship,
and job placement.
We have made a positive difference in the lives of hundreds
of thousands of vulnerable youth. In 1987, MTC took our job
corps knowledge and experience and began operating correctional
facilities with the goal of helping incarcerated individuals
change their lives and reducing recidivism.
In 2006, MTC began providing services to another vulnerable
population, the men and women detained pending immigration
proceedings. MTC again adopted the job corps model of support,
service, training, and respect.
MTC-operated detention facilities provide access to health
care, legal, programming, and faith-based services in safe,
clean, and secure facilities.
As of today, there are a total of 6 active COVID cases at
our facilities. COVID-19 has proven to be highly contagious,
and medical guidance has been fluid since the start of this
pandemic. We have acted with urgency to implement the guidance
from ICE, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and
State and local health departments.
We have a deep concern for the people at our facilities,
and our highest priority is the safety of our staff and
detainees. We are responsive to evolving Federal, State, and
local guidelines. We currently screen all new entrants to our
facilities by placing them in a 2-week quarantine. We test
individuals who are symptomatic or have had contact with
someone with COVID-19. Individuals who test positive are placed
in medical isolation and provided with care.
Employees and those entering the facility are screened
prior to entry. Staff and detainees receive training to
identify symptoms and to help them understand prevention
behaviors like hand hygiene, cough etiquette, social
distancing, and mandatory mask-wearing procedures. Cleaning and
sanitation is enhanced, and social distancing practices are in
place.
We have learned a lot about containing the spread of COVID-
19 the past few months. While there still is a lot that we and
the entire medical community don't know, there are some things
that guide us.
First, testing is a good management tool that gives us
important information to act on. It is not a panacea. Changing
behavior is the difference maker.
Frequently educating detainees and staff on prevention
behaviors is essential. Limiting movement of detainees into
facilities and having space to isolate, cohort, and quarantine
help significantly. Stopping in-person visits except for legal
visits and screening those entering the facility make a
difference.
Finally, cleanliness and good sanitation and insistence on
social distancing, mask wearing, and hand washing is critical.
We will continue to evaluate and apply lessons learned in
managing COVID-19 at our facilities.
I would like to close by thanking the people who work day
in and day out on the front lines of this pandemic, risking
their own lives to keep the men and women in our care safe and
healthy. It is the officers, doctors, nurses, counselors,
chaplains, food service workers, facility administrators, they
are heroes and we couldn't have managed this unprecedented
pandemic without them.
Thank you for allowing me to speak about our shared
interests in successful outcomes for the people in our
detention facilities.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Marquardt follows:]
Prepared Statement of Scott Marquardt
July 13, 2020
Chairwoman Rice, Ranking Member Higgins, and Members of the
committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you and
participate in today's hearing. My name is Scott Marquardt, and I am
the president and CEO of Management & Training Corporation (MTC).
COVID-19 has been an aggressive and unprecedented pandemic that has
impacted all of our lives. I would like to share my company's
experiences responding to COVID-19 in the detention facilities we
operate. We have taken extensive efforts to protect the detainees in
our care, the staff who serve them, and the communities in which we
operate.
mtc was founded to help vulnerable populations succeed
I would like to start by sharing with you who MTC is and the values
we espouse. MTC began in 1981 as an operator of residential Job Corps
centers. We provide low-income youth an academic education and
technical training that leads to career that can sustain families and
improve future employment opportunities. Our success is enhanced by a
holistic approach that includes providing food, shelter, medical care,
recreation, mentorship, and job placement assistance. Ultimately, our
goal is to change the trajectory of disconnected youth, helping them
gain the education and skills needed for career and personal success.
MTC continues to operate Job Corps centers across the country. MTC has
made a positive difference in the lives of hundreds of thousands of
vulnerable youth.
In 1987, using the expertise we developed in operating residential
Job Corps centers, MTC began providing services to another vulnerable
population: The men and women in correctional facilities. Our focus was
and continues to be rehabilitation through programs designed to meet
the criminogenic needs of those whom we serve. In each of the
facilities we operate, we have adopted our Job Corps model, providing
extensive support, training, and rehabilitative programming. The key to
our success is building a culture based on respect and humane
treatment. All of our correctional institutions are held to the highest
standards in providing clean and well-maintained facilities, quality
and timely health care, and programs that are effective in preparing
people for reentry.
In 2006, MTC began providing services to yet another vulnerable
population--the men and women detained pending immigration proceedings.
MTC again adopted the Job Corps model of support, service, training,
and respect. Our facilities prioritize providing access to legal,
health, and faith-based services, providing programming, and ensuring
detainees have a safe, clean, and secure environment. We build a staff
culture that promotes respect and empathy.
MTC currently operates 5 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
(ICE) detention facilities in California, New Mexico, and Texas:

Imperial Regional Detention Facility, located in Calexico,
California, has capacity for 782 detainees. Currently, 276 are
detained in that facility. (35.3 percent)

The Bluebonnet Detention Center in Anson, Texas, has
capacity for 1,000 detainees. Currently, 337 are housed at this
facility. (33.7 percent)

Otero County Processing Center, located in Chaparral, New
Mexico, has capacity for up to 1,089 detainees. Currently, 415
are housed in this center. (38.1 percent)

El Valle Detention Facility, located in Raymondville, Texas,
has capacity for 1,000 detainees. Currently, 333 are housed in
this center. (33.3 percent)

IAH/Polk Detention Center, located in Livingston, Texas, has
capacity for up to 1,052 detainees. Currently, 162 are house in
this center. (15.4 percent)
Individuals at these MTC-operated facilities are there for short
periods of time while they await immigration hearings or deportation.
During their brief stay, MTC provides access to medical care, legal
services, programming, and recreation. At each of these 5 facilities,
individuals live in open-bay housing units with dorms that can
accommodate up to 100 individuals, depending on the unit. As of July 9,
2020, there are 3 active COVID-19 cases among the 5 detention
facilities. Two of these cases are located within the Otero County
Processing Center, and one is located at the El Valle Detention
Facility.
At all of the facilities and campuses where we operate and provide
services, MTC staff are trained on our company philosophy, which is
BIONIC ``Believe It Or Not, I Care.'' It is an operational philosophy
that encourages staff to respect and show genuine care for each other
and particularly for the individuals that they serve.
preserving lives is mtc's first priority during the pandemic
At MTC, our primary mission is to positively impact individuals,
their families, and the community. Since the start of this pandemic,
our top priority has been to take actions that protect the detainees,
guests, and our staff from this virus.
MTC has worked closely with ICE and State and local health
departments to respond to COVID-19. As the CDC and medical community's
understanding of this novel coronavirus has evolved, ICE Health Service
Corps (IHSC) and the local Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO)
field offices have provided on-going guidance to our facilities. MTC
has implemented all guidance at each of our facilities along with the
oversight and direction of our corporate medical director.
MTC has also worked tirelessly to adhere to the guidance provided
by the CDC for ``correctional and detention facilities''. We have taken
action to prepare each facility for COVID-19, prevent the spread of the
virus, and manage any cases of the virus as directed by ICE and
recommended by the CDC.\1\

Facilities. Retrieved from https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
mtc has established and maintained communication with key agencies
It has been vital for us to communicate regularly with ICE, the
State and local health departments, and local and State elected
officials. We have provided proactive updates to local and State
elected officials about the impact of COVID-19 at our ICE facilities,
and we have shared daily updates with ICE.
To work effectively with ICE, each MTC detention facility has
completed a Detention Oversight Unit (DOU) COVID-19 ``Facility
Checklist'' and has provided that checklist to ICE as required. This
checklist allowed facilities to provide ICE documented responses to key
questions surrounding the facility's preparation and preventative
approach to the spread of COVID-19. MTC-operated immigration detention
centers also provide ICE a daily COVID Tracking Report. This inclusive
report includes information regarding cases among detainees and staff.
Each MTC facility also coordinates testing with the State and local
health department and works closely with those departments to track and
monitor any positive cases of COVID-19.
february 2020: mtc took early steps to prepare for threats from covid-
19
As the COVID-19 virus gained attention, MTC followed early IHSC
``interim reference sheet'' dated January 31, 2020, and received
February 3, 2020, that also referenced the CDC guidelines to prepare
for this pandemic at all MTC-operated facilities. In February, IHSC
continued to send facilities materials and we implemented an intake
screening process for new entrants who had traveled to Mainland
China.\2\ Operators were initially instructed to screen detainees
entering facilities to determine if those individuals had traveled to
mainland China or had close contact with an infected individual within
the previous 14 days. Symptomatic individuals were given a mask and
placed in medical isolation. Those with potential exposure were to be
placed in quarantine for 14 days in order to watch for known COVID-19
symptoms.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ IHSC. (2020, February 10). Interim Reference Sheet on 2019--
Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Version 2.1.

This initial screening protocol was implemented at the MTC-operated
facilities. By the end of February, the intake screening process
expanded to identify individuals who had traveled through any
geographic area experiencing wide-spread community transmission.\3\

At this time, medical experts were not in agreement whether the
general population should wear masks. On February 29, 2020, as an
example of the confusion, the U.S. Surgeon General recommended that
citizens should not be concerned with wearing masks.\4\

march 2020: mtc implemented comprehensive changes based on initial
understanding of covid-19
By March, facilities were already screening for COVID-19 during
each intake process and monitoring the on-going updates regarding the
symptoms and epidemiology of COVID-19. Throughout March, ICE provided
extensive, frequent communication to facility administrators with
detailed directions for preventing COVID-19 from spreading at
facilities and to manage any cases or potential cases. In March, the
CDC also published guidelines specifically targeting correctional and
detention facilities.
This guidance did not include a requirement for cloth masks for all
staff and detainees. In March, and even into April, medical experts
still debated the value of face masks. The World Health Organization
(WHO), posted mask guidelines, on April 6, 2020, indicating that
``there is currently no evidence that wearing a mask (whether medical
or other types) by healthy persons in the wider community setting,
including universal community masking, can prevent them from infection
with respiratory viruses, including COVID-19.'' The WHO also indicated
that it did not support the ``wide use of masks by healthy people in
the community setting'' and that ``medical masks should be reserved for
healthcare workers.''\5\

MTC Provided Staff and Detainee Education
On March 5, 2020, IHSC distributed information regarding the
importance of hand hygiene and cough etiquette.\6\ Our administrators
used this information to train staff. Staff reviewed the symptoms of
COVID-19 and methods for preventing its spread. Similar trainings
occurred for detainees during town halls. During these meetings,
administrators and medical personnel impressed upon individuals
important and relevant topics such as the contagious nature of the
virus, review of the symptoms, and good hand hygiene, appropriate cough
etiquette, methods for social distancing, and ways to request medical
support.

preventative behaviors, such as hand hygiene, cough etiquette, and
social distancing.

Facilities posted both English and Spanish CDC flyers and posters
containing educational information regarding hygiene, coughing
etiquette, and how COVID-19 is spread (see ``Attachment A: Every MTC-
Operated Detention Facility Has Posted Signage in Multiple Locations to
Educate Detainees on Preventing the Spread of COVID-19'').
Medical Personnel Determined If Testing for COVID-19 Was Necessary
In a March 6, 2020 update, ICE indicated that when symptoms were
present in an intake interview, medical providers were instructed to
determine if testing was necessary and were ``strongly encouraged to
test for other causes of respiratory illness, including infections such
as influenza.''\8\

MTC Implemented an Incident Command System
On March 11, 2020, each MTC-operated detention center activated an
Incident Command System (ICS). Each ICS aligned with guidelines
provided by Federal Emergency Management Agency.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\9\ FEMA provides ICS information and resources at https://
training.fema.gov/emiweb/is/icsresource/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Facilities used the ICS to identify and organize resources,
establish clear lines of communication, manage the response to this
emergency, and provide transparent communication with community
officials. Within each facility's ICS, the first tactical priority was
establishing and preserving a safe environment for staff and detainees.
Each facility's ICS included action plan objectives that addressed
potential issues with staffing and prepared necessary operational
logistics, such as ensuring we had adequate food, medicines, cleaning
supplies, and sanitation supplies. In developing the ICS, each facility
identified medical isolation and quarantine spaces. Each facility's ICS
also established a command team at the facility, which tracked and
monitored any incidents.
As part of this initial preparation process, MTC facilities ordered
additional hand sanitizer, thermometers, soap, cleaning supplies, and
personal protective equipment. Facilities also planned to work with
State and local health departments for any testing needs although
testing availability was limited throughout March 2020 (see
``Attachment B: MTC Facilities Provide Hand Sanitizer to Staff and
Detainees'').\10\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
MTC Implemented Staff Screening
In conjunction with each facility's ICS, administrators began
screening staff for COVID-19 when they arrived at work each day. This
started as a verbal screening that looked for: (1) COVID-19 symptoms or
(2) contact with someone with a laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19.
Each facility added a temperature check, monitoring staff for fevers of
100.4 degrees or above. Those with COVID-19 symptoms or potential
contact with COVID-19 were sent home, and directed to contact their
primary care physician. If a staff member developed symptoms while at
work, he or she was also sent home. Upon notification that a staff
member was positive for COVID-19, the individual's work space, as well
as common areas, were sanitized. The facilities also conducted a
contact investigation, and any staff identified as having close contact
with the infected individual was sent home from work. This daily
screening process for all employees has continued throughout the course
of the pandemic (see ``Attachment C: Staff Undergo a Daily COVID-19
Screening Prior to Entering A Facility'').
MTC Enhanced Cleaning and Sanitation Practices
On March 12, 2020, IHSC listed actions that facilities should take
to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. These actions included
cleaning equipment, disinfecting items which were frequently touched by
multiple people, increasing the cleaning of common areas, disinfecting
exam rooms between each patient, and ensuring adequate EPA-approved
disinfectants were available.\11\

ICE Suspended Social Visitations
On March 13, 2020, 2 days after MTC activated each facility's ICS,
ICE suspended all social visitations to facilities.\12\ The ERO field
offices also distributed flyers that each facility posted at its main
gate or lobby. These posters listed COVID-19 symptoms and informed
visitors that anyone with these symptoms would not be allowed in the
facility. MTC facilities started encouraging non-contact visits,
providing increased phone and video conferencing opportunities to
detainees. We met with detainees in town hall settings and communicated
this new requirement which impacted visitation.

suspension of social visitation at all its detention facilities due to
COVID-19''.

ICE and the CDC Provided Additional Guidance on Best Practices for
Cleaning Facilities
On March 21, 2020, ICE provided best practices for responding to
COVID-19 to each facility administrator. These best practices
identified EPA-approved cleaning products and additional guidelines for
cleaning the facilities.\13\ Consistent cleaning guidelines were also
provided by the CDC on March 23, 2020.\14\ These guidelines included:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\13\ ICE. (2020, March 21). COVID-19 Best Practices for Detention
Facilities.
\14\ CDC. (2020, March 23). Interim Guidance on Management of
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention
Facilities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cleaning and disinfecting frequently-touched surfaces and
objects, particularly in common areas, several times a day.

Cleaning shared equipment, such as phones, keyboards,
radios, service weapons, keys, and handcuffs several times per
day.

Using household cleaners and EPA-registered disinfectants.
Our facilities immediately worked to align cleaning practices with
the CDC and ICE guidelines. MTC placed hand sanitizer in common areas.
Individuals were provided access to hygiene items such as soap and
paper towels. Cleaning crews, staff, or detainees, used Environmental
Protection Agency-registered, hospital-grade disinfectants to
frequently clean high-touch surfaces and any shared equipment. These
crews or any other individuals increased the cleaning of housing units,
classrooms, recreation areas, kitchen, cafeteria, and other areas where
individuals gather. On a daily basis, MTC provides cleaning supplies
for detainees to clean their personal living spaces (see ``Attachment
D: MTC Provides Cleaning Supplies to Detainees'').
MTC Implements ICE Guidance on Removing Someone from Medical Isolation
On March 21, 2020, ICE shared COVID-19 best practices, which
included criteria which should be met prior to an individual leaving
isolation.\15\ MTC implemented into practice this guidance:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\15\ ICE. (2020, March 21). COVID-19 Best Practices for Detention
Facilities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The individual needed to be free from fever for 72 hours
without the use of fever-reducing medications.

The individual's symptoms have improved or cleared.

The individual has tested negative in at least 2 consecutive
respiratory specimens collected at least 24 hours apart.

At least 7 days have passed since the date of the
individual's first positive COVID-19 test and has had no
subsequent illness.
MTC Implemented Social Distancing Guidelines Provided by the CDC and
ICE
March 23, 2020, the CDC provided guidance to detention and
correctional facilities regarding social distancing in these
settings.\16\ Practicing social distancing can be challenging in
congregate settings, such as the open bay dorms in the detention
facilities. However, MTC implemented social distancing measures in
accordance with the ICE and CDC guidelines. Guidelines included
enforcing increased space between individuals in common areas, choosing
recreation spaces where individuals can spread out and stagger
schedules in those spaces, staggering meals times or providing meals
inside housing units or cells, limiting group activities to small
groups with space, reassigning bunks for greater distance, and
evaluating medical support to reduce potential contact with others. We
quickly implemented these guidelines.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\16\ CDC. (2020, March 23). Interim Guidance on Management of
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention
Facilities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
We reassigned bunks to provide more space between individuals and
arranged bunks so individuals sleep head to foot to increase the
distance between them. We also reviewed and modified scheduled
movements to minimize the mixing of individuals from different housing
areas (see ``Attachment E: MTC Facilities Use Social Distancing to
Limit the Spread of COVID-19'').
CDC Provided Guidelines on COVID-19 Screening, Testing, and Medical
Isolation
The CDC guidance provided to detention and correction facilities on
March 23, 2020, included directions on screening, testing, and
isolating individuals to prevent the spread of COVID-19. These
directions aligned with previous guidance from ICE. The CDC directed
medical staff to ``evaluate symptomatic individuals to determine
whether COVID-19 testing is indicated.''\17\ The CDC also directed
facilities to work with the State, local, or Tribal health departments
to access testing supplies and services.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\17\ CDC. (2020, March 23). Interim Guidance on Management of
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention
Facilities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
MTC facilities have adhered to these guidelines. Our medical staff
screen and care for all those with signs of infection, and we
quarantine those with possible exposure to the virus. Individuals are
quarantined in individual rooms where possible. When the need for
quarantine exceeds the availability of our individual rooms, we
designate a housing unit and cohort those in quarantine in a separate
unit.
When an individual does test positive for COVID-19, the individual
remains isolated under medical care. This medical isolation also uses
designated medical isolation rooms. If necessary, we can use a
cohorting approach and designate a housing unit to medically isolate
positive cases.
Upon identifying that an individual has COVID-19, staff sanitize
all living and common areas the individual had contact with. We also
conduct contact tracing to identify those who have been in contact with
the infected individual. Finally, those in the individual's previous
housing unit are isolated from other populations.
Mitigating Spread of COVID-19 During Transport
MTC recognizes the risk of spreading disease when transferring
detainees and has established procedures to mitigate that risk at our
detention centers. All transfers are screened for COVID-19 symptoms
immediately upon arrival. Symptomatic individuals are promptly isolated
under medical care. Non-symptomatic individuals are placed in
quarantine, so they can be monitored for 14 days before placement in
the general population.
MTC Followed CDC Guidance on PPE
The CDC's guidance on March 23, 2020, also included recommended PPE
for infection control.\18\ MTC provided medical personnel with face
masks, N95 respirators, eye protection, disposable medical gloves,
disposable gowns, and face shields. On March 31, 2020, ICE sent
additional guidance for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE)
by medical personnel. Non-medical providers were encouraged to use
other barriers to cover the mouth and nose, preserving PPE for medical
staff.\19\ We are closely monitoring PPE inventories at the facility
level and overall at the corporate office to ensure adequate supplies
are on hand for staff and detainees.

Transmission (ICE).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
MTC has adhered to CDC guidelines to determine the distribution of
PPE and hygiene supplies. In any circumstances when ICE guidelines are
more stringent, MTC adopts the more stringent guidelines in an attempt
to increase the protection for staff and detainees. MTC does not
require, nor have we ever required, any forms prior to the distribution
of these supplies. Instead, we have provided PPE and other supplies
whenever they are needed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.
Screening Processes for COVID-19 Among Detainees, Staff, and Visitors
Continued to Change
On March 31, 2020, IHSC provided revised screening guidelines,
which eliminated travel-based screening and instead screened new
arrivals based only on symptoms and on contact with any individuals
known to have a laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19.\20\ Each
facility revised its screening instrument in alignment with the
guidance provided by IHSC.

april 2020: mtc adapted practices based on the latest guidelines for
preventing and managing covid-19
Throughout April, ICE continued updating and clarifying practices
around medical isolation, PPE, social distancing, education, and masks.
ICE also focused on identifying populations that were particularly
vulnerable to COVID-19. Communication between ERO field offices and
administrators occurred multiple times per week. ICE also requested
that each facility complete a DOU checklist detailing current COVID-19
preparation levels, preventative practices, and case management steps.
Facilities reported daily on any cases and provided comprehensive
reporting on checklists bi-weekly.
MTC Implements ICE Guidance to Determine When Someone Could Leave
Medical Isolation
On April 1, 2020, IHSC described 2 methods for determining when
facilities could discontinue precautions for an individual: Test-based
or non-test-based strategies. The test-based strategy included the
resolution of fever without medications, improvement in respiratory
symptoms, and negative results of 2 consecutive nasopharyngeal swab
specimens collected at least 24 hours apart. The non-test-based
strategy included 3 days without a fever (without the use of
medications), improvement in respiratory symptoms, and 7 days since the
symptoms first appeared.\21\

ICE Partnered with Contractors to Identify Populations with Greater
Vulnerability to COVID-19
On April 4, 2020, ICE field offices reached out to the
administrators at each of our facilities requesting a list of
individuals who were at higher-risk for serious illness from COVID-
19.\22\ Using the categories identified by the CDC, our medical team
identified those who were pregnant or those who had delivered in the
last 2 weeks, individuals over 60 years old, and individuals of any age
having chronic illnesses which would make them immuno-compromised,
including but not limited to blood disorders, chronic kidney disease,
compromised immune system, endocrine disorders, metabolic disorders,
heart disease, lung disease, neurological and neurologic and
neurodevelopment conditions. ICE used this information to make
determinations about the potential release of those who were at higher
risk from COVID-19.

ICE Reduced the Population in Facilities to Allow for Greater Social
Distancing
On April 10, 2020, ICE reiterated the CDC's early guidance on
social distancing. ICE further indicated that efforts would be made to
reduce the population to at least 70 percent capacity to provide
greater social distancing capabilities.\23\ Currently, the MTC-operated
detention facilities run under capacity, which allows for greater
social distancing measures. Currently none of our facilities has a
capacity over 38.1 percent.

MTC Posted Educational Materials Throughout Facilities
On April 16, 2020, ICE provided flyers and posters containing
educational information about COVID-19 for facilities to post in common
areas. Posters were available in multiple languages, and all MTC
facilities displayed the provided educational materials.
Staff and Detainees Received Cloth Face Masks
Early in April, ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) shared
mandatory requirements for all facilities to adopt. The requirements
instructed facilities to gather PPE for medical personnel and acquire
cloth face masks for staff and detainees. These cloth masks were to be
worn by symptomatic individuals, as well as by any detainees with
confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 outside of an individual's
medically isolated space.\24\ ICE expanded these guidelines on April
20, 2020, determining that all detainees should wear face
coverings.\25\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Following this guidance, MTC provided face masks for all detainees
and staff. Staff are expected to wear masks while on shift. Detainees
are also expected to wear masks when outside of their personal living
spaces (see ``Attachment F: All Detainees Have Received Face Masks'').
ICE Provided Revised Guidance to Determine When Someone Could Leave
Medical Isolation
On April 24, 2020, IHSC updated the criteria for determining if
someone previously diagnosed with COVID-19 could leave medical
isolation and return to the general population. These revised criteria
specified that all individuals should be isolated for a minimum of 14
days after the first positive COVID-19 test. It also provided more
information on non-test-based strategies, differentiating between non-
test-based strategies for febrile and/or symptomatic patients and for
non-febrile and asymptomatic patients. When a patient met criteria for
one of these scenarios, IHSC indicated he/she could be returned to
general housing.\26\ As testing processes have evolved, MTC has
implemented the updated guidelines. MTC facilities are adhering to all
recommended testing approaches.

may 2020: mtc continued to adapt practices to ensure quality support
for all staff and facility residents
As cases became more wide-spread throughout the United States, MTC
took additional precautions to protect individuals residing in the
facilities we operate.
MTC Added Additional Disinfectant Measures at Otero and Bluebonnet
At 2 facilities where we encountered several COVID-19-positive
cases, MTC has taken additional cleaning and sanitation precautions
that were not required by ICE or the CDC. In the Otero County
Processing Center for example, an officer is assigned to walk the
facility with a backpack sprayer with germicidal cleanser, spraying
down frequently touched areas. The Otero County Processing Center and
the Bluebonnet Detention Center both acquired 2 ultra-low-volume
foggers that could spray disinfectant to cover 99 percent of surface
areas. These facilities use the foggers to prevent spread of COVID-19.
We only use EPA-approved chemicals that have been tested to be safe for
human exposure. Out of an abundance of caution, we ensure no detainees
are present during the disinfecting process (See ``Attachment G:
Facilities Have Implemented Increased Sanitation and Cleaning
Practices'').
MTC Implemented Increased Testing Practices at Otero and Bluebonnet
In Bluebonnet Detention Center and Otero County Processing Center
where we had the most positive cases, MTC has implemented more
aggressive testing practices. At the Otero County Processing Center, we
have administered multiple rounds of extensive testing for the 467
individuals in the facility, administering 794 tests. At the Bluebonnet
Detention Center, we have also testing extensively, administering 383
tests.
MTC Tracks and Monitors Cases Closely
MTC continues to monitor all cases at each facility, working
closely with ICE and the State and local health departments. As of July
9, 2020, Imperial Regional Detention Facility and IAH Detention Center
have no active cases of COVID-19, with a combined total of 20 recovered
cases. At the Bluebonnet Detention Center, we currently have zero
active cases, and 290 recovered cases. At the El Valle Detention
Facility, we have 1 active COVID-19 case with 1 recovered case. At
Otero County Processing Center, there are 2 active cases, and 153
recovered cases.
In the Otero County Processing Center and Bluebonnet Detention
Center, the majority of the active cases have been asymptomatic
carriers. MTC was able to identify the asymptomatic cases by
implementing comprehensive testing measures in conjunction with the
State and local health departments. To date, none of the COVID-19 cases
at these 5 facilities have resulted in death.
We also monitor COVID-19's impact on our staff. As of July 9, 2020,
Imperial Regional Detention Facility staff have 4 active cases, while
10 staff have recovered. El Valle Detention Center staff have 11 active
cases, with 1 staff member recovered. IAH Detention Center has 3 active
cases among staff with 3 recovered. At Otero County Processing Center,
we have 6 active staff cases and 8 recovered. At the Bluebonnet
Detention Center, we currently have 8 active staff cases, and 11
recovered cases.
june 2020 to present: mtc continues to follow guidance to protect the
health of detainees, staff, and communities
MTC continued to follow all Federal, State, and local health
guidelines. On July 1, 2020, we began implementing the ICE COVID-19
Pandemic Response Requirements (PRR) Version 2.0 which sets forth
expectations and assists ICE detention facility operators to sustain
detention operations while mitigating risk to the safety and well-being
of detainees, staff, contractors, visitors, and stakeholders due to
COVID-19.\27\ The ERO PRR builds upon previously-issued guidance and
sets forth specific mandatory requirements to be adopted by all
detention facilities, as well as recommended best practices, to ensure
that detainees are appropriately housed and that available mitigation
measures are implemented during this unprecedented public health
crisis. The ERO PRR has been developed in consultation with the CDC and
is a dynamic document that will be updated as additional/revised
information and best practices become available.

conclusion
COVID-19 has proven to be a highly contagious disease, and medical
understanding of this disease continues to evolve. MTC has taken
direction from multiple agencies as we have faced this challenging
situation, such as ICE, CDC, State and local health departments, and
WHO. ICE has adapted its guidelines throughout the course of the
pandemic and communicated changes to contractors (see ``Attachment H:
MTC COVID-19 Response Timeline Summary''). At the facilities MTC
operates, we have focused on preserving lives in the following ways:

MTC has adhered to CDC and ICE and State and local health
department guidance and has immediately implemented any changes
to testing, screening, and sanitation processes and protocols.

As a company, we acted quickly to implement preventative
measures in each of the facilities we operate.

We provided staff and detainees with education on COVID-19
and behaviors that could limit its spread.

We enhanced our cleaning and sanitation practices which were
already at exceptional levels.

We distributed personal protective equipment and cloth face
masks at each facility.

We implemented social distancing practices.

We screened for COVID-19 and used observation, isolation,
and quarantine to separate those with active and potential
cases from the general population.

We screened detainees when they were transferred to MTC
facilities and before they were transferred away from MTC
facilities.

We implemented daily staff verbal screenings and temperature
checks.

Our facility administrators have provided community, State,
and Federal leaders regular updates, and we have acted with a
high level of transparency.
MTC will continue to evolve its approach to managing this disease
as more information becomes available. We remain dedicated to
protecting those who reside and work in our facilities.
I would like to close by thanking the often overlooked heroes who
work day in and day out on the front lines of this COVID-19 pandemic,
risking their own lives to keep the men and women in our care safe and
healthy. It's the officers, doctors, nurses, counselors, chaplains, and
food service workers. They are heroes, and we could not have managed
this unprecedented pandemic without them.

Miss Rice. Thank you for your testimony, Mr. Marquardt.
I now recognize Mr. Cooper to summarize his statement in 5
minutes.

STATEMENT OF RODNEY COOPER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, LA SALLE
CORRECTIONS

Mr. Cooper. Thank you. Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member
Rogers, and Members of the committee, thank you for the
opportunity to testify regarding our COVID-19 response.
It is a privilege to appear before you today and discuss
the tremendous efforts our company is taking to mitigate
impacts of this unprecedented pandemic.
LaSalle Corrections is an established developer and
operator of correctional centers throughout the United States.
LaSalle Corrections has been providing corrections industry
solutions to law enforcement agencies, Federal agencies, and
government municipalities for decades.
Our range of facility solutions include design,
construction, and operations management, along with inmate and
detainee services that cover security, education,
rehabilitation, immigration, and health care.
As a full-service corrections and immigration detention
management provider, LaSalle Corrections specializes in the
management of prisons, jails, and detention facilities, as well
as inmate and detainee transportation services.
Since the onset of reports of COVID-19, LaSalle Corrections
has been tracking the outbreak, regularly updating infection
prevention and control protocols, and issuing guidance. We
implemented our pandemic contingency plan in response to COVID-
19 that includes screening, testing, appropriate treatment,
prevention, education, and infection control measures.
After thorough review and consultation of existing plans,
we formulated revisions to our strategic plans to include a
COVID-19 response plan. Our company's strategic planning
ensures for continuity of operations and a sustainable health
care delivery system.
All emergency services and advanced medical care is
included in our pandemic planning. Also, comprehensive
protocols are in place for the protection of staff and
detainees, including the appropriate use of PPE, in accordance
with CDC guidance.
As you are aware, correctional and detention facilities can
include custody, housing, education, recreation, health care,
food service, and workplace components in a single physical
setting. The integration of these components presents unique
challenges for control of COVID-19 transmission among
incarcerated persons, staff, and visitors.
However, our company's consistent preparation, prevention,
and management measures have served as a foundation to reduce
the risk of transmission and severity of illness from COVID-19.
To date, no one in our care and custody has succumbed to COVID-
19.
Our employees have access to the most current CDC and DHS
guidance and full support and assistance in this rapidly-
changing environment. General guidance for each facility on
COVID-19 in correctional and detention settings include:
Operational and communications preparations for COVID-19;
enhanced cleaning, disinfecting, and hygiene practices; social
distancing strategies; how to limit transmission from visitors;
infection control, including recommended PPE and potential
alternatives during PPE shortages; verbal screening and
temperature check protocols for incoming individuals, staff,
and visitors; medical isolation of confirmed and suspected
cases and quarantine of contacts, including considerations for
cohorting when individual spaces are limited; health care
evaluation for suspected cases, including testing for COVID-19;
clinical care for confirmed and suspected cases; considerations
for persons at higher risk of severe disease from COVID-19.
We are working closely with the Center for Disease Control,
the Department of Homeland Security, and other Federal, State,
and local agencies to facilitate and refine our pandemic
planning.
LaSalle Corrections reviews CDC guidance routinely and
continues to update protocols to remain consistent with CDC
guidance. We will continue to incorporate CDC's COVID-19
guidance, coupled with the rapidly-changing adaptations of
State and local health departments.
Also, LaSalle Corrections continues our focus on
operational and communications planning, reinforcing hygiene
practices, intensifying cleaning and disinfecting of
facilities, and monitoring for potential cases. Facilities will
continue increased social distancing, having staggered meals,
meal locations, and rec times in order to limit large
gatherings.
The responsibility to protect those in our custody is
paramount, and LaSalle Corrections is firmly committed to the
health and welfare of our detained population. LaSalle
Corrections will remain diligent in operating our facilities at
the highest level, providing safe, secure, and humane
surroundings for our staff, those in our custody and the
communities in which we operate.
The skills, talents, and dedication of our work force form
the foundation of our success in responding to this
unprecedented pandemic, and I assure you our team will continue
to work very hard every day to ensure facilities are operating
under the safest and most practical conditions to reduce the
risk of exposure and prevent further spreading of COVID-19.
Thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you
today and for your support. I remain committed to working with
Congress and my colleagues to ensure for the continued welfare
and safety of our detained population.

Prepared Statement of Rodney Cooper
July 13, 2020
Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member Rogers, and Members of the
committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify regarding our
COVID-19 response.
It is a privilege to appear before you today and discuss the
tremendous efforts our company is taking to mitigate impacts of this
unprecedented pandemic.
overview
LaSalle Corrections is an established developer and operator of
correctional centers throughout the United States. LaSalle Corrections
has been providing corrections industry solutions to law enforcement
agencies, Federal agencies, and Government municipalities for decades.
Our range of facility solutions include design, construction, and
operations management, along with inmate and detainee services that
cover security, education, rehabilitation, immigration, and health
care. As a full-service corrections and immigration detention
management provider, LaSalle Corrections specializes in the management
of prisons, jails, and detention facilities, as well as inmate and
detainee transportation services.
pandemic response
Since the onset of reports of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),
LaSalle Corrections has been tracking the outbreak, regularly updating
infection prevention and control protocols, and issuing guidance.
LaSalle Corrections implemented our Pandemic contingency plan in
response to COVID-19, that includes screening, testing, appropriate
treatment, prevention, education, and infection control measures. After
thorough review and consultation of existing plans, we formulated
revisions to our strategic plans to include a COVID-19 pandemic
response plan. Our company's strategic planning ensures for continuity
of operations and a sustainable health care delivery system within
facility settings. All emergency services and advanced medical care is
included in our pandemic planning. Also, comprehensive protocols are in
place for the protection of staff and detainees, including the
appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE), in accordance
with Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidance.
As you are aware, correctional and detention facilities can include
custody, housing, education, recreation, health care, food service, and
workplace components in a single physical setting. The integration of
these components presents unique challenges for control of COVID-19
transmission among incarcerated/detained persons, staff, and visitors.
However, our company's consistent preparation, prevention and
management measures have served as a foundation to reduce the risk of
transmission and severity of illness from COVID-19. To date no ICE
detainee in our care has succumbed to COVID-19.
LaSalle Corrections employees have access to the most current CDC
and DHS guidance and full support and assistance in this rapidly-
changing environment. General guidance for each facility on COVID-19 in
correctional and detention settings include:

Operational and communications preparations for COVID-19

Enhanced cleaning/disinfecting and hygiene practices

Social distancing strategies to increase space between
individuals in the facility

How to limit transmission from visitors

Infection control, including recommended personal protective
equipment (PPE) and potential alternatives during PPE shortages

Verbal screening and temperature check protocols for
incoming incarcerated/detained individuals, staff, and visitors

Medical isolation of confirmed and suspected cases and
quarantine of contacts, including considerations for cohorting
when individual spaces are limited

Health care evaluation for suspected cases, including
testing for COVID-19

Clinical care for confirmed and suspected cases

Considerations for persons at higher risk of severe disease
from COVID-19.
LaSalle Corrections is working closely with the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC), Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and other Federal,
State, and local agencies to facilitate and refine our pandemic
planning and response in confronting COVID-19. LaSalle Corrections
reviews CDC guidance routinely and continues to update protocols to
remain consistent with CDC guidance. LaSalle Corrections will continue
to incorporate CDC's COVID-19 guidance, which is built upon the
established infectious disease monitoring and management protocols,
coupled with the rapidly-changing adaptations of State and local health
departments.
Also, LaSalle Corrections continues our focus on operational and
communications planning, reinforcing hygiene practices, intensifying
cleaning and disinfection of facilities, and monitoring for potential
cases. Facilities will continue increased social distancing through
physical separation, having staggered meals, meal locations, and
recreation times in order to limit large gatherings.
conclusion
The responsibility to protect those in our custody is paramount and
LaSalle Corrections is firmly committed to the health and welfare of
our detained population. LaSalle Corrections will remain diligent in
operating our facilities at the highest level, providing safe, secure,
and humane surroundings for our staff, those in our custody and the
communities in which we operate. The skills, talents, and dedication of
our workforce form the foundation of our success in responding to this
unprecedented pandemic and I assure you our team will continue to work
hard every day to ensure facilities are operating under the safest and
most practical conditions to reduce the risk of exposure and prevent
further spreading of COVID-19.
Thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you today and
for your support. I remain committed to working with Congress and my
colleagues to ensure for the continued welfare and safety of our
detained population.

Miss Rice. Thank you, Mr. Cooper.
I thank all the witnesses for their testimony.
I will remind the subcommittee that we will each have 5
minutes to question the panel.
I will now recognize myself for questions.
Mr. Hininger, first to you, at the Eloy Detention Center in
Arizona, which your company operates, at least 250 detainees
have now tested positive for coronavirus among an average
population of about 1,100 people. That is nearly 5 percent of
the detainees at the facility.
There are also reports indicating that employees have been
pressured to keep working after showing signs of the
coronavirus and that staff are not told when other workers or
detainees have tested positive for the virus.
Will you commit to launching an investigation into these
reports of potential negligence at the Eloy facility?
Mr. Hininger. Thank you for your question.
So let me just first say that, you know, since the
beginning we have been working closely with ICE, our partner in
this case, and also CDC receiving their guidance on exactly how
we should adjust and calibrate our operations appropriately
within our ICE facilities. That has informed our operational
kind of plan and process during that period of time.
As it relates to Eloy out in Arizona, we have had
individuals test positive that you just noted, both staff and
detainees. The numbers I think you have indicated probably are
kind-of year-to-date or during a period of time we have had the
pandemic. They are lower today. In fact, I would say there is
probably about 90 employees, I think, today that are positive
with the COVID-19----
Miss Rice. Sorry to interrupt you, but I have only 5
minutes. I just wanted to ask if you could--yes or no, would
you agree to open up an investigation into those allegations?
Mr. Hininger. Well, we don't have to wait until
investigation. I mean, we are looking at these in real time.
Now, ICE, as you know, has staff actually on-site that is
working with us.
So if it is appropriate or we need to make a change or a
tweak or enhance our processes, we are doing that in real time
and not waiting for an investigation.
Miss Rice. So one of the first pieces of guidance that was
issued by the CDC was if you feel sick, stay home. They say
that to every single American. If you feel sick, stay home.
So I just want to ask all 4 witnesses, yes or no--yes or no
because I have very limited time--will each of you commit here
today that you will let your staff stay home if they are
experiencing symptoms, if they are not feeling well? If all of
you could just answer yes or no.
Mr. Zoley. Yes.
Mr. Hininger. Yes, we did that weeks ago.
Mr. Marquardt. Yes.
Mr. Cooper. Yes.
Miss Rice. Thank you. We know that ICE detainees are still
being transferred between detention facilities around the
country, which is inevitably contributing to the spread of this
virus. Have any of your--again, yes or no--have any of your
companies ever requested that ICE halt transfers to your
facilities due to safety concerns?
Mr. Hininger. No.
Miss Rice. Everyone else?
Mr. Marquardt. For MTC, we are in constant communication on
safety concerns of inmates being transported. We have a dialog
back and forth. If we get somebody with a temperature or
anything, we immediately stop the transfer and we are regularly
in dialog about that issue.
Miss Rice. So if you get someone who actually appears to be
having symptoms, you immediately put them in isolation once
they come to you? You don't refuse them--to take them from ICE?
Mr. Marquardt. Well, if they show up on the bus, they are
held at intake isolated until we get on the phone with ICE and
determine the proper course of action, whether they need to go
to the hospital, they need to go back somewhere else, or what
the--what is going to happen. That happens on a regular basis,
not--so, yes, we are constantly in communication about this
subject.
Mr. Hininger. Yes. At CoreCivic--I mean, it is consistent
probably with the other operators--we have medical staff going
out to the bus and actually doing screening on the bus before
they walk into a facility and determine if they are, you know,
showing symptoms or have a higher temperature, I should say,
then we are isolating as appropriate for additional medical
direction.
Mr. Zoley. We do the same.
Miss Rice. Anyone else?
Mr. Cooper. Same. LaSalle does the same as what was just
mentioned.
Miss Rice. I know other Members, other of my colleagues are
going to be asking about testing, because we know that that
is--without testing, we are never going to be able to get this
issue under control.
So, I guess, you know, yes or no, are you being left to
acquire the testing? I know one of the witnesses said something
about getting 45 Abbott machines soon. But are you responsible
for getting your own testing, or are you getting that from DHS,
ICE?
Mr. Zoley. We are generally--this is George Zoley with the
GEO Group. We are generally responsible ourselves for getting
the test equipment.
Miss Rice. Are you having difficulty doing that?
Mr. Zoley. In the early stages, absolutely. To a lesser
extent to date. ICE did provide us 2 Abbott machines at 2
facilities about a month ago, but more recently this--in the
last few days we have been able to contact the Abbott
corporation and get confirmation of receiving 45 machines in
September, which we are very pleased.
Mr. Marquardt. We have been responsible for getting our own
tests. We have been able to keep up with the requirements of
CDC and ICE from the beginning, although those requirements
have changed, and in the beginning that we weren't required to
use as many tests as we are today.
So today we are getting an adequate supply of tests, but we
have been notified by suppliers that looking forward that could
change. The testing supplies are being deplenished right now
because of the outbreak in so many States across the country.
So we are actively searching for back-up supplies of tests
right now, so we are fine today but concerned about supplies
going forward, particularly if the expectation for higher
levels of testing become the guidance.
Miss Rice. OK. Thank you, all. I want to thank you for your
testimony here today. I now recognize the Ranking Member, the
gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. Higgins.
Mr. Higgins. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.
Mr. Zoley, if you could respond to this question, sir. I
understand you have no role in setting or enforcing immigration
policy, but according to our research, groups have targeted
your company specifically because you provide contracted
services to ICE. It is my understanding that some of your
facilities have been subject to some sort of vandalism and
attack. Can you tell us a little bit about that, please?
Mr. Zoley. Yes. We have had facilities in Colorado,
Washington, and California that have undergone not only large-
scale protest demonstrations but destruction of property. We
have had shootings in Tacoma, Washington, and our regional
office in Texas. It is just unbelievable the level of----
Mr. Higgins. Have you--and thank you for your response. In
the interest of time, have you responded with enhanced
security? Have you felt the need to respond with enhanced
security at your facilities?
Mr. Zoley. Yes. We have spent millions of dollars in
additional fencing, better coordination with local law
enforcement, and our host communities, and we think we have a
better situation now than we did----
Mr. Higgins. So----
Mr. Zoley [continuing]. Before.
Mr. Higgins. Excellent. Would you feel that you could say
that your facilities were targeted because you do contract work
for ICE? Because that doesn't appear to be happening at other
facilities that do not have a relationship with ICE.
Mr. Zoley. It would seem to be so, and it is unfortunate
because we think our facilities are very new, excellent
physical plant facilities with air-condition and all the
amenities described under the Obama administration. We are
doing the same things we have done for years, and we don't
understand the need for these protests.
Mr. Higgins. Well, thank you, sir. These are difficult
times. It is a passionate consideration in our country and
folks get emotional, but we must maintain law and order. So I
encourage you to pursue that in a compassionate manner.
Mr. Marquardt, you described your systems as being--in my
opinion, I would summarize it as saying that you have a very
proactive response to COVID-19. You mentioned some procedures
that have been put in place that are very impressive, in my
opinion.
What would you say your percentage is of COVID-19 tests?
And I do not have a copy of your written testimony in front of
me, and I did not hear you mention that. What percentage of
your population is tested according to your guidance?
Mr. Marquardt. We are following the guidance of CDC and
ICE, so anybody who exhibits symptoms would be tested. In New
Mexico, the State of New Mexico and this Congressional
delegation, Representative Torres Small, the Governor, and
others on the delegation have been very interested in this
topic.
Cooperatively they have helped us enhance our supply of
tests, and we are testing every--we have tested every single
detainee in the facility and continue to test every detainee
that comes into the facility.
Mr. Higgins. So you are testing 100 percent of your
detainees?
Mr. Marquardt. At that facility.
Mr. Higgins. At that facility.
Mr. Marquardt. Yes.
Mr. Higgins. Do you know of any business or governmental
entity that is testing 100 percent of their population and
their staff?
I don't know of any.
Mr. Marquardt. I can't give you one, but I imagine there
are. Well, I mean, in terms of a regular business, no. I am
sure----
Mr. Higgins. An incarceration facility.
Mr. Marquardt. It is widely being discussed as a possible
solution for the future. There is a lot of discussion about it.
I don't think it is happening too many times. In terms of the
availability of tests, it is probably not practical right now.
One of the problems with testing is----
Mr. Higgins. Well, that is one of our endeavors, good sir.
Again in the interest of time, it is for this subcommittee
to help to make it practical because it is what we seek across
the aisle. We have a great deal of agreement that increased and
enhanced testing should become the norm.
We shouldn't be talking about testing, you know, 5, 10, 20
percent of our incarcerated children of God. We should be
pushing to get to 100 percent. I encourage you gentlemen all to
work with Congress and your contracts to make that happen.
Mr. Zoley, my final question--and I am not sure how much
time I have left--you have been providing services to Federal
and State and local agencies for more than 30 years. During
that time, as a partner to Federal agencies under Democrat and
Republican administrations, if your services were not available
to Federal agencies as you serve, what would be the result
absent a change in immigration law? What if your services were
gone? Tell us the impact.
Mr. Zoley. If the private sector was not playing the role
it is playing today, the Federal Government would have to hire
thousands of new employees and spend several billions of
dollars building new facilities which would take many, many
years to accomplish if they were to do so.
Mr. Higgins. I appreciate that summary.
Madam Chair, it has been mentioned to me that perhaps we
will have a second round. I do have additional questions, but
in respect to the time of my colleagues, I yield.
Miss Rice. Thank you, Mr. Higgins. If we do have time, we
will be doing a second round.
I now recognize the Chairman of the full committee, the
gentleman from Mississippi, Mr. Thompson.
Mr. Thompson. Thank you very much, Madam Chairman.
For our witnesses, I really appreciate your companies
providing the committee with the documents that we have
requested.
Can each of you tell us how many employees who have tested
positive for COVID-19 to date?
Mr. Hininger, Mr. Zoley, Mr. Marquardt, and, Mr. Cooper.
Mr. Hininger. For CoreCivic, we have about 14,000
employees, of which about 500 employees have tested positive.
Miss Rice. If I could just interrupt for 1 second. We are
having an issue with the live feed, so we are going to take a
very short recess.
Please, everyone, just stay where you are, if you can, so
we can get the technical issue addressed. Thank you very much.
[Recess.]
Miss Rice. The committee will reconvene.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Mississippi, Mr.
Thompson, to continue his questioning.
Mr. Thompson. Thank you very much, Madam Chairlady.
Mr. Hininger had responded to my question, and I was going
to Mr. Zoley.
Mr. Zoley. I honestly forgot the question, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Thompson. OK. We were talking about the number of
employees that you had impacted by COVID-19.
Mr. Zoley. Sure. We have approximately 3,700 employees at
ICE facilities. We have tested 991: 167 were positive, but 69
have recovered. Eight hundred sixty-four were negative. There
is only 1 GEO staff member in the hospital at this time. There
have been zero COVID-19 deaths among staff.
All staff receive wellness training daily upon arrival into
the facility. Any staff not cleared are denied entry into the
facility and are sent home and advised to be tested by their
physician.
Mr. Thompson. Thank you very much.
Mr. Marquardt.
Mr. Marquardt. We have 1,200 employees at the detention
facilities that we operate, and 73 of them have tested
positive.
Mr. Thompson. Mr. Cooper.
Mr. Cooper. Yes, sir. We have just over 3,000 employees.
Cumulative number of staff testing positive was 144.
Mr. Thompson. Thank you very much.
Did this--we will go back around again for the question.
Did this testing positive impact your ability to staff the
facility or do you have a plan in place to manage COVID-19-
related shortages?
Mr. Zoley. This is George Zoley at The GEO Group.
That situation has not impacted our ability to have
adequate staffing primarily because we are at 50 percent
occupancy or less. So the staffing that is necessary is
substantially less.
Mr. Thompson. Thank you.
Mr. Hininger.
Mr. Hininger. Yes, sir. It is a very similar answer. Our
occupancy in our ICE facilities is kind-of in the range of 50
to 75 percent occupancy. So that has affected staffing in a
positive way.
Additionally, we have got a lot of our facilities in close
proximity with other facilities that house ICE detainees. That
gives us the flexibility to move staff between facilities also.
Mr. Thompson. Mr. Marquardt.
Mr. Marquardt. Similarly, we have not had a problem
staffing our facilities.
Mr. Thompson. Mr. Cooper.
Mr. Cooper. I would say this, as the others, we have
facilities that are close enough that we can pull staff, if
needed, from other facilities.
Mr. Thompson. OK. Well, the fact that you have a population
that you are managing that is highly potentially contagious,
how do you determine which employees get tested?
Mr. Hininger first.
Mr. Hininger. Yes, sir. So we do testing every day, at
every shift, I should say, for every employee that comes into
the institution, both a temperature check and then also a
symptom check. If an employee is not cleared when they enter
the facility, then they are asked to be sent home. They are
told that, you know, no worries about their job or their
salaries or benefits, you know: Stay home. It does appear that
potentially you have symptoms for COVID.
Typically, within a day or two, they get tested. If they
are positive, then obviously they follow the guidance of the
CDC, which is 14 days of being self-isolated at home, and,
again, no adverse impact to their employment or salary and
benefits. We have made that clear to our employees.
Mr. Thompson. Mr. Zoley.
Mr. Zoley. My response is similar, Mr. Chairman, with the
exception that we have at 9 facilities done saturation testing.
That is testing all detainees, all staff, and we are asking for
permission from ICE to do the same at our other facilities.
Mr. Thompson. Thank you.
Mr. Marquardt.
Mr. Marquardt. We do similar screening of all employees
entering the facility, temperature check, asking if they have
traveled anywhere or had symptoms, the same questions.
In terms of a COVID-19 test, tests would be available to
employees who exhibit symptoms, who have had exposure to
someone with COVID-19. The availability of tests for employees
in the community varies greatly by communities. But in many
communities, it has been fairly easy to anybody that is nervous
at all, doesn't really have to have a reason, can just go into
a clinic or setup in parking lots, or wherever they are, and
get tested.
So there has been good availability, and we are following
the guidelines of ICE and CDC in testing.
Mr. Thompson. OK. Well, yes, I understand that. But I am
talking about for your employees who come to work, do you have
a specific protocol for them?
Mr. Marquardt. Yes.
Mr. Thompson. Not out in the community but----
Mr. Marquardt. Yes, yes. We do the same screening. So they
would be screened at the entrance to the facility. They could
not enter the facility until they tested--or had a temperature
check. If they are 100.4 or above, they cannot enter the
facility. We go through a variety of screening questions every
time they come into the facility to check that.
Mr. Thompson. Mr. Cooper.
Mr. Cooper. Yes, sir.
Mr. Thompson. I beg your pardon?
Mr. Cooper. Can you hear me now?
Mr. Thompson. I have got you now.
Mr. Cooper. OK. It shows me still being muted. I don't know
why.
Yes, sir, we do the same sort of screening with every
employee that comes in and make sure they are not allowed in if
they don't pass that screening. We have done employee
saturation testing at one facility, but that was just last
week, and we don't have all of those results back.
Mr. Thompson. Thank you very much.
I yield back, Madam Chair.
Miss Rice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I now recognize the Ranking Member of the whole committee,
the gentleman from Alabama, Mr. Rogers.
Mr. Rogers. Thank you, Madam Chairman.
Can you hear me?
Mr. Zoley, we all recall the tremendous challenges of
organizations that our country and around the world were facing
due to shortages of personal protective equipment back in March
and April. In fact, many organizations are still facing those
same challenges. But I understand that you were able to deploy
PPE to all staff and detainees at your ICE facilities very
early in this pandemic.
Can you share with us how you as a private-sector company
were able to work with your suppliers to ensure enough PPE for
all of your detainees and employees early in the pandemic?
Mr. Zoley. I think it is primarily because we are
potentially a large-scale user, so we were able to place very
large orders of hundreds of thousands of masks and gloves to
vendors who wanted our business, frankly, and they gave it to
us, I guess, before they gave it to somebody else.
Mr. Rogers. Yes, I have heard reports of that around the
country.
Mr. Marquardt, we are constantly learning new information
and abiding by updated guidelines, guidance throughout this
pandemic. When new guidance is issued or a problem arises at
one of your facilities, what process or procedures do you have
in place to address or resolve those new guidances or new
problems?
Mr. Marquardt. In terms of COVID procedures?
Mr. Rogers. Yes.
Mr. Marquardt. Well, it is a weekly, if not daily,
occurrence that new information has been coming out, and we
change procedures accordingly. We have an incident command
structure similar to what Mr. Hininger explained is going on at
CoreCivic. But in early March, we implemented the incident
command system at all of our facilities and as a corporation,
and so it is on a daily basis we are making sure that supplies
are available to all of our facilities, that there is a command
structure in place for any issues that come up, that we have a
plan, an action plan for what needs to be accomplished that day
or that week. So that is how we monitor supplies.
We have a medical director that is monitoring CDC every day
on what new guidance comes out, and through our incident
command system, we relay that to all of our facilities and, you
know, they have done a phenomenal job in reacting. You know, we
haven't really had any problem with staff or detainees in terms
of--I mean, this is an inconvenience to everybody. But
everybody, through education and training, we have explained
the importance and how critical this is, and people pitch in
and go the extra mile to do whatever we ask and whatever CDC
guides us to do.
Mr. Rogers. Great.
This would be for each panelist. I have heard the word
overcrowded used or misused as it relates to ICE facilities
during the pandemic. But it is my understanding that all ICE-
dedicated facilities have been operating at 70 percent or less.
Could each of you address the issue of capacity at your
facilities and share how your facilities are abiding by CDC
guidance based on that capacity?
I will start with Mr. Zoley.
Mr. Zoley. Yes. As I said previously, Representative, our
facilities are less than 50 percent capacity. So that permits
us to have improved social distancing in dormitory-style
housing, as well as cell-room-style housing, as well as rooms
for occupancy of 4 or 8 individuals. We can split that--all of
those things into half and separate people into alternating
bunks, alternating rooms, and alternating housing units. So it
has worked very well.
Mr. Rogers. Mr. Hininger.
Mr. Hininger. Yes, sir. So we have about, in round numbers,
about 17,000 beds that we have available to ICE on any given
day, but typically operational occupancy is anywhere from kind-
of 9,000 to 11,000 historically, but today we are under 6,000.
So, yes, we are pretty close to about 50 percent occupancy. So
that is obviously pretty consistent with CDC guidelines
relative to lowering occupancy and density and allow us greater
flexibility not only for staffing but also for detainees for
social distancing.
Mr. Rogers. OK. Mr. Marquardt.
Mr. Marquardt. Before the pandemic began, there was already
a very rapid decline in ICE populations under way, and that has
continued every month of this year. So our populations are
right now at 34 percent of occupancy or full occupancy. So we
have quite a bit of room for social distancing, for cohorting,
for isolating individuals or groups of people that come in on
different days on different buses. So we really have not had a
problem with that. ICE has taken pretty much all of the high-
risk detainees out of the population. So today any detainee
over 55 years of age or that has any chronic condition will not
come into one of our facilities. So all of these things have
added to help us in dealing with the pandemic.
Mr. Rogers. Thank you. My time has expired.
I yield back, Madam Chairman.
Miss Rice. Thank you, Mr. Rogers.
I now recognize the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Payne.
Is Mr. Payne on?
OK. I now recognize----
Mr. Payne. Hello. I am here.
Miss Rice. He is. Thank you.
Mr. Payne. Thank you.
Madam Chair, I appreciate the opportunity to speak today on
what I feel is a very timely topic for the committee to
explore.
Let me say, even before the pandemic, detainees had
reported troubling instances, abuse of force, solitary
confinement, and punishment in retaliation for speaking out
about poor conditions of confinement in at least one of your
detention facilities.
Since COVID-19 pandemic reports such retaliatory action
wrong more frequent, including at least 12 instances of use of
tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, and SWAT-like units,
are your contract guards carrying pepper spray and tear gas?
I would like you each to respond, please.
Mr. Marquardt. I will respond for MTC.
I am not aware of the incidents that you are talking about.
Our detention officers do not carry pepper spray. We have it
on-site; if there were an incident, that we are prepared to
handle it, but we have not discharged it and have not had that
problem. I mean, I regularly visit the detention facilities. I
talk to detainees, hundreds of them, and I always ask, you
know, how are you doing? You know, I ask about their stories,
how they have been treated, the food, the medical care. You
know, generally it is a very positive story and they are
appreciative. I mean, we treat them with respect and dignity,
and they are very appreciative of that.
Mr. Payne. Can I----
Mr. Marquardt. Go ahead.
Mr. Payne. Thank you for that answer, but I have a few more
to get to.
Next, please.
Mr. Hininger. Damon Hininger.
So, no, pepper spray [inaudible] is not carried on the
individual. But I think it is pertinent to note that we follow
ICE detention standards. So it governs what our employees are
able to carry while they are working at institutions. Then
second is ICE has staff on-site full time that are inspecting
operations in real time.
Mr. Payne. Thank you.
Mr. Zoley. This is Mr. Zoley from The GEO Group.
My answer is similar to Damon's, and that is our staff
individually do not carry pepper spray. It is available in that
sense in a special location, but it is only done so with
approval of ICE who is on-site.
Mr. Payne. Thank you.
Next.
Mr. Cooper. This is Rodney Cooper with LaSalle.
My answer would be much like Mr. Hininger's. We do have it
available if needed, but we do follow all of ICE's standards in
regard to the use of any chemical agents.
Mr. Payne. OK. Thank you.
Are you aware that, according to medical experts,
irritants, such as the pepper spray, can induce coughing and
increase a person's chance of catching a respiratory illness
such as COVID-19?
Does anybody want to respond?
Mr. Zoley. Well, not to--this is George Zoley from The GEO
Group.
I know we go through special health care protocols when
pepper spray has been used. Everybody is taken into the health
care unit for examination, if necessary. So we know that it may
cause some kind of illness or some side effects, and,
therefore, we do proactively engage the [inaudible] use of
pepper spray to medical and get a thorough screening; but I
wasn't aware it could have an effect on COVID.
Mr. Payne. OK. Well, let me ask something, another--so no
one is aware of any time when rubber bullets or pepper spray or
tear gas have been used by officers at your facilities against
detainees since the COVID-19 pandemic began?
Are you all categorically denying it?
Mr. Marquardt. MTC has not used any of those devices since
the pandemic began, no.
Mr. Payne. OK. Thank you.
Mr. Hininger. Same thing for CoreCivic, absolutely not.
Mr. Payne. Thank you.
Mr. Zoley. This is George Zoley from The GEO Group. We had
an incident at our Adelanto, California, facility where
chemical agents were used.
Mr. Payne. OK. All right.
Is there one more gentleman? Did I get everyone?
Mr. Cooper. Rodney Cooper with LaSalle.
I am not aware of any use of chemical agents since COVID-
19.
Mr. Payne. OK. All right. Well, I am glad one gentleman
acknowledged that there was an issue. I know I wasn't crazy or
just making it up, but--OK. Detainees at--oh, it was Torrance
County facility in New Mexico--were on days' long hunger strike
to protest the horrible food and their vulnerability to COVID-
19 when guards reportedly corralled the protesting detainees
and then proceeded to pepper spray them. There are similar
accounts from facilities across the United States.
You know, let me just say that there has been a difficult
issue with the definition of detainees. They are not convicts.
They are being detained. I think what happens is the lines get
blurred, you know, to one person being a convicted criminal as
a detainee. I would hope that all of you can clarify to your
staffs the difference between the two and act accordingly
because I don't think people are just making these things up.
Something is happening. Maybe at times it gets blown out of
proportion or, by the time it gets through the fifth person, it
is exaggerated maybe, or maybe not. Maybe these things are
happening. I would really suggest to you that you keep a strong
oversight on these issues because, if and when we find out
otherwise, there are going to be repercussions that I don't
think any of you would like to see or appreciate.
With that, Madam Chair, I yield back.
Miss Rice. Thank you, Mr. Payne.
I now recognize the gentlelady from Arizona, Mrs. Lesko.
Mrs. Lesko. Thank you, Madam Chairman.
And I want to thank all of the CEOs that have come to
testify today. We are all in this together, and it has been
difficult. It has been a difficult for not only, I am sure,
your companies, but for hospitals, for nursing homes, for all
of us. So I can see the sincerity in your voice when you say
that you are doing everything that you can to protect your
employees and the detainees, and so thank you.
I do want to ask a question or give an opportunity to Mr.
Hininger, who is with Core, and I went down to the Eloy
facility--I don't know, this was a while ago, it was pre-
COVID--and I thought it was run well. But in the news recently,
you have been--that facility in Eloy, Arizona, has been in the
news recently and has been brought up by the Chairwoman. They
said these are the allegations--and I am sure you are aware of
them, but basically it said that there is a shortage--well,
that masks and gloves are rationed. There is a shortage of
staff, and detainees are saying they only have like an hour out
of 24 hours that they are out of their cell or room. As has
been said before, 127 of 300 employees tested positive. ICE
reported 242 immigrants held in Eloy tested positive since the
beginning of the pandemic.
So, Mr. Hininger, I just want to give you an opportunity to
respond because I know that media is not always accurate, and
sometimes they are biased. So if you would like to respond.
Mr. Hininger. Congresswoman, thank you very much, and thank
you again for your recent visit to Eloy. We are very proud of
that operation, along with all of our operations around the
country.
So, yes, a little bit to your points there, the Eloy
facility does have an adequate supply. I know that you
mentioned the masks. We have, as of last week, 152,000 masks
Nation-wide within our facilities, and so we have got plenty of
masks in inventory. But also we have the flexibility, if we
have a little bit of a higher usage at one facility, then we
can, through our central purchasing program, we can relocate
masks to other facilities if there is higher utilization versus
lower utilization. So adequate supply is there.
You noted also the staff there at Eloy. So we did have
almost about half of our staff, over the period of time of the
pandemic, test positive for COVID-19, but that was just in a
point in time, not at one point in time where all of those
staff were positive. So, as of last week, we had about less
than a hundred that were positive, and we are going through the
appropriate protocols to self-isolate.
But also, to your point about staffing, it was mentioned
earlier about occupancy. So, again, Nation-wide we are about 50
percent occupancy, and what that does, it gives us flexibility
on staffing because if you are staffed for more like 90, 95
percent, then you are overstaffed obviously based on occupancy.
As you know, Congresswoman, we have got another ICE facility
there in Eloy just down the street that has an ICE contract. So
we were able to move staff between facilities if we did have a
fair amount of staff at Eloy that again were self-isolating
because they were found positive through a test, so, again,
very comfortable with the staffing levels and to be able to
kind-of change our staffing as appropriate between those
facilities if we did have a higher case.
I guess the final point I would make relative to the cases,
as you know, in Arizona, there has been a little bit of an
uptick in positive cases within the State itself, and I would
say, reflective of our staff, I think we are pretty consistent
with what we are seeing in the general community.
Mrs. Lesko. Thank you.
I have another question for all very quickly. Who is
required to wear the masks in your facilities? Is it just
employees, or is it employees and detainees?
Mr. Hininger. Yes, ma'am. So this is Damon Hininger again.
So it would be our company policy--and, obviously, we are
following CDC guidance, along with ICE detention standards--
that all employees are required to wear masks, and it is
recommended to detainees.
Mr. Marquardt. For MCT, all employees are required to wear
masks, as our detainees.
Mr. Zoley. Same answer for The GEO Group.
Mr. Cooper. The same for LaSalle.
Mrs. Lesko. Thank you.
Madam Chairman, I yield back.
Miss Rice. Thank you, Mrs. Lesko.
I now recognize the gentleman from California, Mr. Correa.
Mr. Correa. Thank you, Madam Chair. Can you hear me?
First, I want to thank you, Madam Chair, and our Ranking
Member for holding this most important hearing, and I also want
to take a moment to thank our witnesses today for taking time
and interest in being with us here on these very important
policy issues.
A question for all four of you. Mr. Marquardt, you
mentioned that you had rapid decline in population before
COVID-19. Is that correct? What was the reason for that?
Mr. Marquardt. You all probably know much more about that
than I do, but, you know, there is a seasonal difference
usually in detention facilities. You know, in the winter,
Christmastime, the border crossings tend to go down. There has
been----
Mr. Correa. So it is seasonal?
Mr. Marquardt. I don't think that is the entire reason. I
think there is a number of factors: Asylum hearing changes----
Mr. Correa. Thank you.
Same question for the other witnesses.
I only have 5 minutes, my apologies.
Mr. Marquardt. All right.
Mr. Correa. Gentlemen?
Mr. Zoley. Similar answer by The GEO Group.
Mr. Correa. OK.
Mr. Hininger. Yes, sir, a similar answer for CoreCivic,
too. We did see a change in the winter going into the spring
months.
Mr. Correa. Thank you.
Mr. Cooper. The same for LaSalle.
Mr. Correa. Thank you very much.
There has been some reports that some of the detainees have
been asked to disinfect their own cells and that they have been
doing so without disinfectants. First of all, can the 4 of you
answer the question: Is that the case? Do the detainees--are
they asked to clean their own cells, disinfect their own cells,
and are they given proper equipment and disinfectants to do so?
Mr. Marquardt. For MTC, all employees and all of the
detainees are part of the hygiene and sanitation process. So
everybody has a role to play in that, cleaning their own areas,
and it is a group effort. We have been very careful to have
adequate supplies of disinfectant and cleaning materials and
have not had any shortages of that.
Mr. Correa. Same question for the other witnesses, please.
Mr. Hininger. Yes, sir. It is Damon Hininger.
So, yes, we do request that detainees clean up their
general housing area, which would be their bunk and their desk
and general area of where they reside. There is adequate
cleaning supplies. Those supplies do not require any protective
equipment. So they are very well-known cleaners that you
typically see in a setting like this or health care or other
social setting.
Mr. Correa. So you provide them the proper disinfectants to
do so?
Mr. Hininger. Yes, sir.
Mr. Correa. Would disinfect for COVID-19?
Mr. Hininger. Yes, sir.
Mr. Correa. Same questions for the other 2 witnesses,
please.
Mr. Zoley. This is George Zoley with The GEO Group.
Yes, we use ICE-approved disinfectants that are
continuously available to staff and to residents to clean all
hard surfaces and the housing areas.
Mr. Cooper. This is Rodney Cooper with LaSalle.
I would say that we do the same thing. They are required to
clean their own cell or area, but they are given appropriate
equipment and training to do so.
Mr. Correa. Do you have any kind of supervision to make
sure that they are doing some kind of an adequate job of
disinfecting their cells? COVID-19 is very infectious, as you
know, and our goal, whether it be in the United States or in
other countries, is to make sure that we minimize the spread of
COVID-19. A lot of detainees may end up being deported, and we
don't want to spread this COVID-19 any more than has--you know,
we want to minimize the spread, I should say.
Do you do any supervision to make sure that those detainees
are doing an adequate job of disinfecting their own cells, a
question for all 4 of you, please?
Mr. Hininger. Yes, sir. This is Damon Hininger again.
So, yes, we absolutely have staff there in the actual
housing areas that are regularly walking not only along the
cells but frequently going inside the cells to check for
cleanliness, and that is a practice you do even outside of a
pandemic like this. Then, like was said, with the cleaning
supplies, typically those are either in the unit or actually
right outside the unit, but they are in close proximity. So
they are always available.
Then, finally, I would just say that we are doing a lot of
town hall meetings in the units reinforcing the message about
hygiene but also cleanliness within the unit and their housing
areas and continue to kind-of reinforce that education.
Mr. Zoley. This is George Zoley with The GEO Group.
Yes, we have maintenance supervisors that assist in
supervising detainees in carrying out their housekeeping
responsibilities. Additionally, we have monitors in every
housing unit that continuously display good housekeeping
practices regarding sanitation, washing of hands, and taking
health care precautions.
Mr. Marquardt. Yes, hygiene and sanitation could not be a
higher priority for us. It is critical, and it is, again, every
person's job to do that. Every detention officer is trained on
their expectations of managing housing units to assure that is
happening. Supervisory staff have roles to come in and do
audits and inspections, and the facility administrator is on
top of that as well. So, I mean, everybody is very focused on
it. It is not an issue that we are fighting people over. They
understand how critical this is, and it is a group effort.
Everybody is pitching in.
Mr. Cooper. This is Rodney Cooper.
I hate to sound like a broken record, but I would agree. I
would also say that COVID or no COVID, if an inmate doesn't
clean their housing area and our staff notice it, then they are
going to move them out of that area to clean the area and go
back in behind it and clean that cell up.
Mr. Correa. Thank you very much, gentlemen.
Madam Chair, I am out of time, so I yield. Thank you very
much.
Miss Rice. Thank you, Mr. Correa.
I just want to direct a question to Mr. Hininger. Earlier
Mr. Payne referenced a use-of-force incident at the Torrance
Detention Center. You claimed that there have been no use of
pepper spray agents or rubber bullets at any of your facilities
since the COVID outbreak. In public reporting, however, even
CoreCivic's spokesperson acknowledged that pepper spray was
used.
Would you like to address the statement of that
spokesperson and amend your earlier statement?
Mr. Hininger. Yes, Chairwoman. I am very sorry. I
understood the question was relative to ICE detainees relative
to the COVID-19 and not compliant with COVID-19. I apologize.
Yes, we did have a use of pepper spray at the Torrance County
facility that was referenced earlier.
Miss Rice. Thank you, sir.
I now recognize the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Joyce.
Mr. Joyce. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.
I would like to thank all of the witnesses for appearing
today and additionally to thank all Members of ICE and CBP for
their continued work and service to our Nation in this
unprecedented time that we have faced since COVID-19.
Mr. Marquardt, briefly, what I have been hearing is that
there have been a lot of changing protocols, changing
guidelines as we have learned more about this novel
coronavirus. Can you please give us a quick overview of how
your company specifically has been able to implement these new
protocols and new guidelines?
Mr. Marquardt. Well, yes. They are not anything
complicated. I mean, PPE is a good example. At the beginning of
this pandemic, there was limited supplies, and the guidance
was, you know, PPE should be reserved for those in medical
fields. The Surgeon General in late February said people other
than the medical workers should not be using it. So, I mean, we
weren't at that point. Then that changed in March pretty
quickly, and we had to quickly up--I mean, we already had
supplies on hand. So we were never without it, but we had to
make a--you know, we didn't have supplies for every staff and
every detainee to wear it. We quickly mobilized. We increased
our orders.
A number of our correctional facilities started projects
with offenders to make masks. We have made tens of thousands of
cloth masks, which are primarily what the employees who are not
dealing with COVID-positive detainees are wearing, and so we
have made tens of thousands of cloth masks and used them for
our own use, as well as distribute them in the community
through community service projects.
Testing procedures have changed dramatically from start to
finish. I mean, every component of this, you know, we learn
along the way and have changed hygiene recommendations, PPE
recommendations, testing recommendations. More is learned, you
know, when somebody needs to be transported to a hospital, I
mean, every component of this. So, as I said earlier, we have a
medical director on our corporate staff who was monitoring this
and helping us give directions to each of our facilities about
what changes they need to make on a regular basis.
Mr. Joyce. I mean, I congratulate you on your adaptability.
As more testing has become available, have your protocols
specifically changed on which detainees are tested?
Mr. Marquardt. Well, I mean, we are really relying on the
guidance of CDC and ICE more than coming up with our own
protocols. I mean, we may make certain adaptations just in
terms of the layout of the facility and how we have to
implement a specific recommendation, but we are not coming up
with different recommendations than what CDC and ICE are
telling us to do. We work with local and State health
departments. As I said earlier, the State of New Mexico has
been very interested in this topic, and we have worked
cooperatively with them and made a number of changes in how we
are doing these things, which, you know, have been great
suggestions and very welcome.
Mr. Joyce. I think that you following local, State, and CDC
recommendations are imperative. I think that is definitely what
is necessary.
Now, you mentioned about your ingenuity in making face
masks. What are the requirements for wearing face masks?
Mr. Marquardt. You mean who has to wear them?
Mr. Joyce. Exactly.
Mr. Marquardt. Everybody does. All employees who are
working in the facility and all detainees have to wear a face
mask at all times. Detainees do not have to wear a face mask
when they are eating. They do not have to wear a face mask when
they are sleeping. But other than that, you know, any movement
around the facility, they have to have a face mask on, and our
employees do as well, and we are actively enforcing that.
Mr. Joyce. Earlier it was stated that changing behaviors is
essential for safety. So, really quickly, as my time is
expiring, what are the consequences if employees or detainees
do not follow your protocols?
Mr. Marquardt. Well, we have a progressive discipline
process for employees which we could implement if we needed to.
But as I said, this really hasn't been a disciplinary
situation. Everybody is very concerned about that. They welcome
the information that we are giving them, and they are--it just
hasn't been a problem getting people to buy into this. So it
hasn't been a problem. We haven't been disciplining many people
at all.
Mr. Joyce. Thank you for your concise answers.
Madam Chair, I yield the remainder of my time.
Miss Rice. Thank you, Mr. Joyce.
I now recognize the gentlelady from the State of New
Mexico, Ms. Torres Small.
Ms. Torres Small. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, and thank
you also, Ranking Member.
Mr. Marquardt, according to ICE, as of July 10, in the
Otero County Processing Center in the district I serve, there
have been 142 positive cases, which makes the facility within
the fifth highest number of cases in the country.
Briefly, because I have several questions I want to ask,
can you please list the top 3 reasons why Otero has seen nearly
150 cases of COVID-19?
Mr. Marquardt. Well, Otero currently has--the Otero
Processing Center currently has 2 positive cases. So, I mean,
there has--that number is true in the past, but it is not true
today. So we have brought down the number significantly. But to
answer your question why----
Ms. Torres Small. Just to clarify on that point, it is
because you have released detainees, correct?
Mr. Marquardt. Well, more of the reason is, you know, they
did a mass test in the facility, and the vast majority of the
people that tested positive were asymptomatic, and so there was
a large number that came on as a result of the testing. That is
not the only reason, but it is the biggest reason. So, just
through the normal course of the infection, it takes, you know,
2, 3 weeks sometimes until a person is symptom-free and would
test negative. Here we are at that facility, we have tested
everybody, as you know.
Ms. Torres Small. Right.
Mr. Marquardt. So we are through the testing and lack of
symptoms, just through the normal course of the progression of
the disease, the infection, we are down to 2 right now.
Ms. Torres Small. I understand that, and I think I will
actually move on from this question, as there are others I want
to get to. But I do just want to note that 142 cases,
regardless of whether they are symptomatic or not, caused
concerns for me both within the detention facility and also in
the community that I serve surrounding it, since you have got
staff who are working there and, asymptomatic or not, provides
a potential for, as we have seen, an increase in the spread of
COVID-19.
I just want to move on quickly to your contract with Otero
County and ICE. I really appreciate the questions from Ranking
Member Rogers surrounding the capacity and ability to social
distance to reduce the spread of COVID-19, and I wanted to
follow up on that conversation.
Mr. Marquardt, on March 31 of this year, MTC sent a letter
to Otero County issuing a notice of termination with respect to
the Otero County Processing Center. MTC cited the reason of
termination to ``the significant decrease in the detainee
population.''
``MTC also noted it had hoped ICE would keep the facility
full and remain hopeful that the detainee population will
increase.''
So it is my understanding that MTC is currently negotiating
a contract modification to continue operating the facility. So,
based on that letter, it seems like MTC's profits depend on a
high detainee population. Is that correct?
Mr. Marquardt. The issues at the Otero Processing Center
were that the facility was designed for almost 1,100 detainees,
and we staff inventory for at that level. The actual number of
detainees in the facility dropped to around 300, so we----
Ms. Torres Small. So don't the profits depend on the high
detainee population?
Mr. Marquardt. The terms of the contract, I guess, would,
but you know----
Ms. Torres Small. OK.
Mr. Marquardt [continuing]. Our greatest priority is the
safety and health of the detainees. It has nothing to do with
profits, and we would never make a decision on profits and not
the safety and health. The county----
Ms. Torres Small. I appreciate that, Mr. Marquardt. Just
because my time is short, I want to make sure and continue. So
I appreciate you answering my question, but your contract is
determined based on the number of detainees that are in the
facility. I also appreciate your concern and your statement
that you would never then seek to have a higher population if
it would put the risk of detainees or staff operating the
facility at risk or the health of them at risk.
So, during a pandemic, would you agree that increasing
detainee populations to pre-pandemic levels would compromise
the health of detainees and the staff that would work in
detention facilities?
Mr. Marquardt. I think we can gear up at a variety of
different levels to keep everybody safe, but I would not at all
deny that the current low levels have been coincidentally, or
purposely, have been helpful in managing the pandemic because
we have a lot of room for social distancing and keeping people
safely apart. So I think that what has happened is not a bad
thing at all.
Ms. Torres Small. Would you agree that increasing the
population to pre-pandemic levels could compromise detainee and
staff health?
Mr. Marquardt. Well, I mean, I think it is a more
complicated question than a yes or no. I mean, there are a
number of factors in that. We could come up with different
procedures to maintain distancing at higher levels. So I don't
think just automatically, because they are higher levels, it
makes the facility unsafe. But we have to think through every
one of those elements of making the facility safe and, at
whatever level, make sure that we can ensure that happens.
Ms. Torres Small. My time has expired.
Thank you.
Mr. Marquardt. Thank you.
Miss Rice. Thank you, Ms. Torres Small.
I now recognize the gentleman from Mississippi, Mr. Guest.
Mr. Guest. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.
Gentlemen, I appreciate each of you for appearing before
the committee today. You perform a very important service for
our country in a very difficult time with the outbreak of
COVID-19.
While I am not able to speak about every facility that each
of you operate, I am able to speak about one. CoreCivic
operates the ICE detainee facility in my district in the State
of Mississippi. Mr. Hininger, I want you to know that the
administration at that facility has been in regular contact
with myself and my staff throughout the COVID-19 outbreak. I
can tell you that, from those conversations, I believe that you
have taken very aggressive steps to protect the safety of
detainees and the employees that work there at that facility.
So, Mr. Hininger, I want to ask you, as it relates to
CoreCivic, when did your organization begin to monitor the
pandemic?
Mr. Hininger. Congressman, thank you for your question.
So it was really in early February as we were monitoring
the outside environment, not only internationally but
nationally, and also getting direction from the CDC. It was
during that period of time that we started taking proactive
steps to check on things, not only on protective equipment, but
supply chain and maybe additional things that we needed to
tweak relative to our operations to make sure we were prepared
with ultimately what became the pandemic that we live in today.
Then it was a little later in the kind-of winter-spring
months that we activated our Emergency Operations Center that I
mentioned earlier, and this center is consistent with kind-of
the protocols that you would see at FEMA and also uses similar
software. We activated that in early March, and it serves as
kind-of a clearinghouse to digest information from CDC and ICE
that we can quickly push out our facilities from a policy and
process perspective, but also allow for real-time adjustments
because, as everybody here on the committee knows, adjustments
have been made and guidance has also changed during that period
of time. So we want to make sure that we can quickly get that
information out.
Then, finally, we also started in early March a COVID-19
task force, had a leader of the task force that has experience
in these type of events, and also our chief medical officer,
along with other operational leaders, and, there again, also
providing real-time kind-of guidance, advice, and medical
direction to all of our leadership within our facilities.
Mr. Guest. As you say, guidelines change from CDC, from
ICE, from some of your local and State health departments. Have
you had to be flexible and make changes to the things that you
were doing at your different facilities?
Mr. Hininger. Yes, sir, absolutely. So CDC and ICE, again,
have been kind-of the lead on providing us guidance and
direction and feedback on our policies and processes. But also
we are watching closely on what Governors and their public
health authorities and also city and county leaders are doing,
too. It has been a little bit of a customized approach based on
certain jurisdictions, not only just from steps and protocols
and requirements, but also what's going on in the community. If
we see an event in the community or in the State where you have
a higher number of positive cases, obviously, we know that has
an impact on us and that also maybe have little different or
changing requirements or guidelines from State or local
officials.
Mr. Guest. Mr. Hininger, there was some conversation early
on about when inmates are transferred to a facility, about the
processing of new detainees or the detainees that are
transferred to one of your facilities. Can you speak on that
just a little bit and expand on that, if you will?
Mr. Hininger. Yes, sir. So we have a process that has been
endorsed and somewhat directed by ICE that we do a protocol for
every group of individuals that are leaving our facilities. So
we go through this checklist. Again, it is a document that has
been endorsed by ICE. Additionally, we get a medical check
done. They get a medical check done by them, by our medical
staff, depending on where they are being transferred to. Also
many of them, again, depending on the medical authority, may
get an actual test before they get--before they depart the
facility, so many different steps. At the end of the day, we
are following the direction of ICE on the appropriate steps we
need to take before a transfer takes place.
Mr. Guest. When individuals are transferred into your
facility and they are showing symptoms of COVID-19, what would
happen to that detainee at that point?
Mr. Hininger. Yes. So we would--again, when, say, a
transportation vehicle or a bus comes in the sally port, we
have staff, along with medical staff, going on the bus
immediately, doing quick symptom and temperature checks. If
they are coming into the institution and if they are showing
signs of COVID-19, then they would be isolated. But regardless,
I should say, anybody coming into an institution from outside
is going to be isolated and quarantined for 14 days before they
go into general population.
Mr. Guest. Thank you.
Madam Chairman, I yield back.
Miss Rice. Thank you, Mr. Guest.
I now recognize the gentlelady from New York, Ms. Clarke.
Ms. Clarke. Thank you very much, Madam Chair.
Let me thank our Ranking Member, Mr. Higgins. Let me thank
our panelists for appearing before us today.
We know that more than 3,000 immigrants in ICE custody have
tested positive for the coronavirus. Given the lack of testing
in ICE facilities, we all know that true number is much, much
higher. We also know that much more could be done to protect
immigrants in custody from COVID-19, but, unfortunately, this
administration, and I also believe your companies, have failed
to put safety first.
Today is about accountability. Many ICE detention
facilities are run by private companies such as yours. When you
are in the business of detaining immigrants and implementing
the policies of this administration, you don't get to just
answer to your stakeholders. You must also answer to us. You
must answer to the families of immigrants in your custody who
right now are worrying not only about the immigrants in your
custody. Right now, they are also wondering whether they will
ever see their loved ones again once ICE deports them, but also
about whether they will each catch the coronavirus in one of
the crowded cells that tend to be the case with your business
models.
So let me ask, here are a few facts. Not enough is being
done to stop the spread in your facilities: 286 detainees at
Bluebonnet Detention Facility tested positive, 250 detainees at
Eloy Federal Contract Facility, 202 detainees at Montgomery
Processing Center, 126 detainees at the Winn Correctional
Center.
People detained at Eloy, operated by CoreCivic, also report
numerous instances in which people who may have been exposed to
COVID-19 are grouped together, a dangerous practice known as
cohorting, which is directly linked to the spread of COVID-19
in detention.
So my question is for all of you, gentlemen, why do you
think your facilities were unable to control the spread of the
virus in your facility? Was it the surprise element? Was it a
lack of resource? What was it that you failed to recognize that
in congregate areas such as yours the spread would infect
rather rapidly?
Do you want to start, Mr. Cooper?
Mr. Cooper. Yes, ma'am, I would be happy to. Thank you.
You know, you mentioned our being responsible to you, but I
feel like we are also still responsible to the good Lord, and
so that is the one I care about the most of how we treat
detainees and how we treat anyone. So the safety of everyone is
our concern. As far as, you know, stopping COVID, I am pretty
comfortable that if----
Ms. Clarke. I am pretty sure I said to control it.
Mr. Cooper. Ma'am?
Ms. Clarke. I said I am pretty sure that my question was
what do you to control it, not stop it, but control it?
Mr. Cooper. Well, you know, to control it, of course, we
follow the CDC guidelines, the guidelines handed down by ICE,
and from public health authorities. I think it has been very
successful when we look at the numbers that we had initially
and we look at the numbers we have now. Of course, when you do
mass testing, you are going to get some higher numbers.
However, you know, I think we have--I think our staff has done
very well to try to control it as best we can. You know, the
fact that, as I mentioned in my opening statement, that we have
not had any detainees succumb to COVID-19, I think that speaks
for itself.
Ms. Clarke. Mr. Hininger.
Mr. Hininger. Yes, ma'am. So we have a 24/7 operation, so
we are always thinking about the unexpected. So if it is a
natural disaster, if it is a pandemic like this one, if it is
communicable diseases, we are always thinking about, you know,
how do we prepare for the unexpected? So I talked a little bit
earlier about not only the investments we made in the EOC and
also the COVID-19 task force, but we really also have really
leaned on CDC and their guidance on what we should be doing
both proactively but also during this pandemic along with
obviously the direction that we are getting from ICE.
So have we been perfect? Absolutely not. But I feel very
confident in saying that we have made big investments in not
only protective equipment but also making sure that we have the
appropriate staff, that they feel comfortable and safe when
they come into our institutions. As I mentioned in my prepared
remarks, we have also rewarded them with a bonus that we called
a hero bonus and also give them extra time off, and then also
told them, if they feel sick, don't come into work, self-
quarantine for 14 days.
So, again, we have not been perfect, but I feel good that
we have made the appropriate investments along the way.
Ms. Clarke. Mr. Zoley.
Mr. Zoley. We have also invested heavily in the protective
equipment that we have distributed to all of our employees, all
of our detainees. But we place also an importance on testing.
We have tested almost 5,000 detainees to date, and we believe
saturation testing, that means testing everybody, is the best
thing you can do, and that is why we are excited about getting
45 of the Abbott machines, which are the most effective test,
because people talk about tests----
Ms. Clarke. When do you believe that that will be in full
effect?
Mr. Zoley. We are hoping in September when we get the
machines.
Ms. Clarke. Very well.
Mr. Marquardt.
Mr. Marquardt. I think we have--there is no greater
priority for us than the health and safety of the detainees and
staff that work there. So we are going to do everything that we
possibly can. There isn't a perfect solution. Until there is a
vaccine and a cure for this unfortunate infection, we are going
to have the same problems that the community has. The big
advantage that we have is the ability to isolate and control
movement that schools and everybody else in the community does
not have, and that gives us a big advantage in controlling the
spread. There are really--the biggest thing we can do, I think
testing is an important management tool, but it is not the
panacea as I said in my opening statement. The thing that is
going to make a difference is controlling behavior, and there
is 3 specific things that we----
Ms. Clarke. I apologize, I apologize. I am over time, and I
appreciate your responses, gentlemen. Look forward to following
up with you.
Madam Chair, I yield back.
Miss Rice. Thank you, Ms. Clarke.
I now recognize the gentlelady from California, Ms.
Barragan.
Ms. Barragan. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.
Mr. Zoley, this question is for you and Mr. Hininger.
Miss Rice. I am sorry, Ms. Barragan. I overlooked the
gentlelady from Texas, Ms. Jackson Lee. I apologize.
Ms. Jackson Lee. I thank the Chairwoman and Ranking Member
for yielding and for this hearing, along with the full
committee Chair and Ranking Member.
Gentlemen, you are being asked questions over and over
again. Please understand that it is our crucial responsibility
to engage in oversight.
With that in mind, I think it is appropriate, because I am
in one of the hotspots and your facilities are located in a
hotspot, among others, and that is the State of Texas. We now
have 265,000 cases and 3,252 people have died.
For this meeting and many others that I am dealing with, as
well as a major testing, is life and death, and I would
disagree with the gentleman who indicated the testing--he might
want to correct his statement--is not important. It is one of
the most important elements of stopping the community spread,
particularly as it relates to the idea of asymptomatic persons.
So let me ask each person, realizing the shortness of my
time, I just need very quick answers. Mr. Hininger, what is
social distancing to you? How do you space out the detainees,
very quickly, please?
Mr. Hininger. Yes, ma'am. Thank you for your question.
So, quite simply, it is, you know, the guidance, which is 6
or further apart from each other, but also, as it relates to
our institutions, making sure that there is appropriate
distance in certain service areas, like in food service,
medical, or other areas where there would be common usage
between detainees.
Ms. Jackson Lee. Thank you.
Mr. Zoley, what is it for you?
Mr. Zoley. Very similar answer. That is, we have benefited
from having the capacity that is less than 50 percent. You can
put people at greater distances from each other, whether they
are in dormitory housing or room-style housing, things----
Ms. Jackson Lee. How are you dealing with the new
information--forgive me, my time is short--that COVID-19 is
airborne? That has been recent information. How are you dealing
with that? How secure are your--are you using N95 masks?
Mr. Zoley. We are using the surgical masks for the
detainees, which are replaced 2 or 3 times a week or as
necessary or at their request. Staff are in a different kind
of----
Ms. Jackson Lee. I think the masks need to be certainly
more solid than that.
Mr. Marquardt, are you retesting, and what do you do with
asymptomatic persons? Do you retest? One test may show you are
negative and you may be positive within a week or so if you
have been exposed. That includes employees as well as
detainees.
Mr. Marquardt. Let me just clarify that I did not say
testing is not important. I said it is not a panacea. But
testing and changed behaviors are the best tools that we have
to control this pandemic, so----
Ms. Jackson Lee. Please highlight it as one of the most
important elements, because that is only way that you can get
information.
Mr. Marquardt. I totally agree with you.
Ms. Jackson Lee. Are you retesting? What are you doing
about asymptomatic persons?
Mr. Marquardt. Well, asymptomatics are probably the most
difficult part of this equation because someone can be
asymptomatic and we don't catch them through our screening
procedures. Once a person takes a test--I mean gets the virus,
it takes 2--an average of 2 days, up to a maximum of 5 days
before they would test positive in a test. So even if we are
testing every person that comes in----
Ms. Jackson Lee. But are you are you retesting? That is my
question. Are you retesting?
Mr. Marquardt. It depends on the facility. We have a
facility in New Mexico that we have tested and retested every
person in the facility. So at other facilities there is less
availability of testing, and that is not happening.
Ms. Jackson Lee. All right. Thank you.
Mr. Cooper, do you have medical teams on-site of your
facilities?
Mr. Cooper. Yes, ma'am, we do have medical teams on-site.
Ms. Jackson Lee. Does that include a doctor?
Mr. Cooper. We have doctors that--at some locations doctors
are there every day. Some locations doctors come by 2 to 3
times a week.
Ms. Jackson Lee. All right. Thank you very much.
Mr. Zoley again, let me ask you to look into your Leidel
center on Commerce Street in Houston, Texas, where it has been
reported to me that there is several deaths in that facility,
and I would like to make sure that you get back to me directly
on that.
So let me move on. With respect to the White House task
force--did you hear me, Mr. Zoley, about the Leidel center?
Mr. Zoley. Yes, I did. Yes I did.
Ms. Jackson Lee. All right. So that I will ask for you to
get back to me directly.
But as it relates to the White House task force, have they
been engaging with each of you about particular ways you can
handle detention centers and your facilities? I will start, Mr.
Cooper, have you been engaged with the White House task force?
Mr. Cooper. Ma'am, I have not personally been engaged with
the White House task force, but I do see the guidance that
comes out through the CDC.
Ms. Jackson Lee. Do you follow that? You follow that?
Mr. Cooper. Yes, we do follow CDC guidelines.
Ms. Jackson Lee. Mr. Cooper, do you follow that?
Mr. Cooper. Yes, ma'am. Can you hear me?
Ms. Jackson Lee. Yes. Do you follow that?
Mr. Cooper. I said we do follow the CDC guidelines and DHS
recommendations.
Ms. Jackson Lee. All right. Thank you.
Mr. Marquardt, do you follow that?
Mr. Marquardt. Absolutely. We have been very rigorous in
following CDC, ICE, and State and local health guidelines.
Ms. Jackson Lee. Mr. Hininger.
Mr. Hininger. Yes, ma'am, similar answer. CDC, ICE, and
city, county, and State.
Ms. Jackson Lee. Thank you.
Mr. Zoley. Thank you very much.
Mr. Zoley. Yes, ma'am. Same answer.
Ms. Jackson Lee. Thank you very much. That includes Dr.
Anthony Fauci, who I have great confidence in and hope that he
will continue his work in spite of being demonized by
unfortunate conversations. I think it is important that we take
note of the fact that Dr. Fauci has been an instrumental part
of the White House task force.
With that, Madam Chair, I am happy to yield back, and thank
all the witnesses for their presentation. There will be a
number of issues that I would like to follow up on, more
extensive understanding of medical teams there, as well as
retesting and what they are doing with asymptomatic persons. I
think that is crucial with the close proximity of these
detainees in order to save lives.
Thank you, and I yield back.
Miss Rice. Thank you, Ms. Jackson Lee.
I now recognize the gentlelady from California, Ms.
Barragan.
Ms. Barragan. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.
Dr. Zoley and Mr. Hininger, I serve as the second vice
chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. On Friday, June 10,
our Chairman, Congressman Joaquin Castro, sent a letter to the
both of you.
The letter deals with concerns that CHC has regarding the
treatment of individuals in ICE and ICE-contracted facilities
in regards to the coronavirus pandemic and the ability of
facilities to contain the spread of the virus.
The letter requests that you both brief the Hispanic Caucus
on the questions and concerns that we have. Will you both
commit to doing that, and if so, when? Dr. Zoley.
Mr. Zoley. I think I would. I have been honestly quite busy
preparing for this meeting, so it would be sometime this month.
Ms. Barragan. Thank you, sir.
Mr. Hininger.
Mr. Hininger. Ma'am, I am aware of the letter received, I
think, late Friday afternoon, and we will follow up with staff
as appropriate.
I know that we have several facilities within Member
districts on that committee or in that caucus, I should say,
and always available for tours or opportunities to see the
operations first-hand.
Ms. Barragan. OK. I noticed you didn't make a complete
commitment, but I hope you will meet with the Hispanic Caucus.
We have a huge constituency, and as you said, many of our
Members you have facilities in.
Dr. Zoley, Federal judges have found that at least 2 of
your facilities, Adelanto in California and the Broward
Transitional Center in Florida, or BTC, were creating
unreasonable risk to detainees.
In the case of Adelanto, the judge found that the facility
had created a massive risk of COVID-19 infection. The DHS
Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties at inspecting
Adelanto also recently found failures in leadership,
``contributed to the inadequate detainee medical care that
resulted in medical injuries.''
In the case of BTC, among other facilities in Florida, a
judge recently found the conditions rose to deliberate
indifference and recently raised concerns about a continued
failure to provide detainees with bare minimum necessities,
tantamount to the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment.
Again, these are the words straight from the court and the
judge. How can we take your assurances today seriously when
your facilities repeatedly failed to live up to the basic
standards?
Mr. Zoley. We think our facilities are not only meeting the
standards but are exceeding them. You know, we have on-site
medical staff as well as on-site ICE presence that helps
oversee whether we are meeting the contractual requirements.
Ms. Barragan. Well----
Mr. Zoley. ICE has a very sophisticated health services
unit that also oversees all the health services at all ICE
facilities. I think it is really hard--to any health care
correctional organization in the world.
Ms. Barragan. OK. Well, Dr. Zoley, I mean, I just remind
you that these are words from a court and from a judge. In
addition, findings from the Office of Civil Rights and Civil
Liberties, which ICE concurred with, made these findings.
So if you really don't see how that is a concern and that
you don't believe it is happening, I think that maybe there
needs to be a real sit-down and a look into how there is such a
huge difference between what the office is saying and what the
judge is saying, which differs from what we are hearing from
you today.
For the GEO Group, in April, a group of women held at the
LaSalle ICE processing center came forward alleging that they
went several days without access to soap or other cleaning
supplies that would protect them from the virus.
Since these concerns were raised, at least 15 migrants held
at the facility have tested positive for the virus. Has GEO
independently investigated these reports and determined if
negligent actions have fueled the spread of the COVID-19 in the
detention center and local communities?
Mr. Zoley. I am honestly not familiar with that situation,
and I would find it surprising because we have had sanitation
and hygiene products available continuously. I would like to
get back to you as I investigate that.
Ms. Barragan. That would be great. I really would
appreciate that.
Can you help shed some light on what steps you have taken
to respond when a detainee has concerns like this, that they
don't have access to proper hygiene products?
What is your policy with providing personal protective
equipment to detainees? I know employees probably get them, but
what about detainees?
Mr. Zoley. Well, our policy is to make it continuously
available. What does that mean? It means that they get it by
schedule 2 or 3 times a week, and they get it when they--if
they ask for it--that they have run out of it and they need
some more, it should be available at all times.
That is my desire, and I think that is our policy.
Ms. Barragan. OK. The first part of that question, if you
can't respond today, getting back on what steps you take when a
detainee raises concerns about not having access to proper
hygiene, that would be really helpful.
Mr. Zoley. OK. Well, I have never received such a request
personally myself, so----
Ms. Barragan. Well, does your staff raise it to your level?
Mr. Zoley. Yes.
Ms. Barragan. I understand that a detainee wouldn't have
access to you directly just as----
Mr. Zoley. Well, they do. They send me a letter.
Ms. Barragan [continuing]. When one of my constituents
calls me, it goes up the chain, and I hear about it when there
are concerns. So do you not hear about these?
Mr. Zoley. I get letters all the time, and I refer them to
the appropriate division within our company.
Ms. Barragan. OK. Madam Chairwoman, I yield back.
Miss Rice. Thank you, Ms. Barragan.
I now recognize the gentleman from Colorado, Mr. Neguse.
Mr. Neguse. Thank you so much, subcommittee Chairwoman
Rice, for allowing me to participate in today's hearing.
Prior to COVID-19, the GEO-run detention center in Colorado
was known for complaints regarding a variety of civil rights
and medical violations. These complaints are not unique to
Colorado, as my colleague Representative Barragan just
referenced, and unfortunately poor conditions that already
existed have only been exacerbated by the failure of ICE and
private contractors to adequately respond to COVID-19.
As governments around the world implemented lockdowns and
other measures to slow the spread, the Trump administration
took a different approach of continuously transferring
detainees between facilities multiple times a week and
sometimes daily.
In recent weeks, my office has heard reports of dozens,
potentially hundreds of detainees being moved in and out of the
Colorado facility with little to no notice to the individual
being transferred or their family or their lawyer.
So, Dr. Zoley, yes or no, will you commit today to
providing at least 24 hours' notice in advance to the families
of a detainee and their lawyer upon notice of a transfer out of
the Colorado facility?
Mr. Zoley. I don't know if I have that ability.
Mr. Neguse. Well, I guess what I would say, Dr. Zoley, is
to the extent you have the ability, if ICE is informing you
with enough time for you to provide that notice, will you do
so?
Mr. Zoley. I would have to look into our ICE procedures and
whether I am allowed to do something of that nature.
Mr. Neguse. Well, I guess what I would say, Dr. Zoley, is
the notion that you would be unable and that your facilities
would be unable to provide a modicum level of notice to
individuals who are being transferred in the dead of night to
at least tell their families before that is done, to me is a
bare minimum requirement, and it is disappointing that you are
unable to commit to that today.
Mr. Zoley. Could I comment----
Mr. Neguse. Another question I guess that I would pose to
you, we have also heard reports that some of these transfers
could be in retaliation for speaking out against inhumane
treatment or a lack of PPE, soap, safe hygiene products.
Dr. Zoley, do you have any knowledge of any ICE transfers
being implemented into and out of your facilities such as the
Colorado facility for any retaliatory reasons?
Mr. Zoley. No, I do not.
Mr. Neguse. Are you aware of a transfer of 100 or more
detainees recently being transferred out of the Colorado
facility to places such as the Teller County Jail?
Mr. Zoley. No, I am not.
Mr. Neguse. OK. Well, if you would be willing, I certainly
would appreciate if you could direct your team at the Colorado
facility to respond to our inquires in that regard as we have
tried to obtain more information about these transfers.
I want to ask you about the use of a powerful chemical
disinfectant referred to as HDQ Neutral and Halt inside some of
the immigration detention facilities. Our understanding is that
it is causing bloody noses, rashes, nausea, difficulty
breathing.
The manufacturer has very strict warnings about their use,
only outdoors or in a well-ventilated area, and yet there have
been reports of their use in crowded and confined spaces at the
Adelanto Facility, Northwest Detention Facility, and in Aurora,
which are all GEO-owned, including using those and being
sprayed while detainees are still in the room.
Can you commit today that GEO will immediately stop using
those dangerous chemicals to the extent they are used not in
line with manufacturer's instructions?
Mr. Zoley. No, I cannot. We have been using that cleaning
product, which is registered with the Environmental Protection
Agency and follows strict safety guidelines set by FDA. The HDQ
Neutral cleaning product has been used at the Adelanto
facility, as well as other facilities for 9 years----
Mr. Neguse. The question, Doctor----
Mr. Zoley [continuing]. And has never reported any adverse
effects by anybody. There is no documentation----
Mr. Neguse. The question, Dr. Zoley--I will reclaim my
time.
The question is not as to whether or not you will stop
using the chemical but making sure that it is being used in
line with the manufacturer's instructions. That is all.
Mr. Zoley. Absolutely. Absolutely. I misunderstood your
question then.
Mr. Neguse. The last question I have for you is regarding
performance-based National detention standards. As you know,
the ICE performance-based standards say that detainees shall be
available--or excuse me, shall be able to volunteer for work
but otherwise shall not be required to work.
Has GEO ever used the threat of solitary confinement or
segregation or other sanction to force individuals to clean and
sanitize common areas?
Mr. Zoley. Detainees are required by ICE to keep their own
personal areas clean, and that is a requirement by ICE.
Mr. Neguse. I am not asking about the personal areas, Dr.
Zoley. I am asking about common areas. But how about this, I
will rephrase it. Has GEO ever coerced immigration detainees
into volunteering to perform work by threatening or imposing
disciplinary segregation, administrative segregation, or
solitary confinement or any other kind of sanction?
Mr. Zoley. Absolutely not.
Mr. Neguse. OK. Well, as I am sure you are aware, there are
multiple lawsuits pending against GEO where allegations have
been made precisely on that basis.
My understanding from a letter that was made public last
year, your senior vice president for business development
asserted that to the extent the plaintiffs in those lawsuits
were alleging that disciplinary segregation was an unlawful
threat for refusal to work, that that sanction came directly
from ICE policies.
Yet, we can find nowhere in an ICE policy where that--such
conduct would be permitted. So I would ask that you follow up
with our office in writing with respect to that particular
reference to ICE policy.
Mr. Zoley. OK. I will.
Mr. Neguse. With that, I yield back, Madam Chair.
Again, thank you for allowing me to participate.
Miss Rice. Thank you, Mr. Neguse.
I have a question just to all 4 of our witnesses. Will you
each commit today to adding a page on your website to report
daily the number of COVID-positive employees at each of your
facilities used for immigration detention operations?
This is something that ICE does, and I am assuming that if
ICE can do it, all of you should be able to do it. So I would
like to get an answer from each of you, just yes or no, would
you commit to adding a page to your website with that
information?
Mr. Hininger. Madam Chair, Damon Hininger, we would
absolutely follow up with ICE. If it is in accordance with them
and appropriate then we would absolutely do that.
Miss Rice. Well, if they do it, there shouldn't be any
objection that they have to you doing it.
Mr. Hininger. Yes. We are a contractor so we just need to
make sure we are following the appropriate terms and conditions
of our contract, but we will absolutely follow up with them.
Miss Rice. OK. Mr. Zoley.
Mr. Zoley. Similar response.
Miss Rice. Mr. Marquardt.
Mr. Marquardt. We are open to doing that, assuming, again,
it is OK with ICE and doesn't violate any HIPAA standards of
the people involved, but, yes, we would be open.
Miss Rice. It is the numbers, not the names. It is just the
number of employees, not the names.
Also, finally, Mr. Cooper.
Mr. Cooper. As the others have said, we would be happy to
get with our Government partner and discuss that.
Miss Rice. OK. Thank you.
Mr. Higgins, do you have a final question you would like to
ask?
Mr. Higgins. I do, Madam Chair.
Regarding contact tracing, Mr. Marquardt, I took a note
during your opening statement that you had advised that your
detainees were questioned in some manner to determine if they
have been in contact with any other human being that is known
to have COVID-19.
How are you possibly accomplishing that? It is difficult
enough in a cooperative and free environment, and here you are
dealing with children of God that have been detained for one
reason or another by the decision of ICE.
But just knowing who they are communicating with, who their
families are, who they have been in contact with, and including
from other nations, how are you conducting contact tracing with
your detainees successfully? You seem to indicate you are doing
so successfully.
Mr. Marquardt. I think my comment earlier was in regard to
screening detainees coming into the facility and asking them if
they have been traveling to any high-impact areas, like China
or other places. That was it in the beginning, and other places
have been added since then.
Mr. Higgins. OK. That----
Mr. Marquardt. In terms of actual contact tracing, we would
only be doing that within the facility if somebody has tested
positive in our facility.
Mr. Higgins. Understood. Yes, I heard your answer
incorrectly earlier.
Madam Chairwoman, I thank you very much for convening this
hearing. Despite the technological challenges, it was wonderful
to see you all, and I look forward to restored regular order
where we can commune in person. I yield.
Miss Rice. Thank you, Mr. Higgins.
I also just want to see if we are in a position to do
another hearing like this. It is my understanding that the
Republican side did not ask to have a witness at today's
hearing, and I wish I had known that because I would have
suggested that you get someone from ICE.
Maybe they would have had a more affirmative answer to you
than they would have, you know--maybe they wouldn't have quoted
OMB guidance. But you and I can talk off-line about that.
Mr. Higgins. Does the gentlelady yield?
Miss Rice. Yes.
Mr. Higgins. Let me say that I have had some indirect
contact with ICE about their participation in a hearing like
this, and they are following guidelines. They are receptive to
meeting and to attending a hearing like this in the future.
But their guidelines call for at least the Chair of the
Majority to be present with their--they have to appear in
person. So that is my understanding, and I am prepared to stand
corrected, and hopefully we can work together as we always have
and make that happen.
Miss Rice. Absolutely, Mr. Higgins. I would be more than
happy to sit with you in the committee room if that will get
ICE to come.
Mr. Higgins. Yes, ma'am. You have my word, good lady, that
I will work with the Minority staff and my friends at ICE and
my contacts there. We will circle back with your office and
through the Chairman, of course.
Miss Rice. Thank you so much, Mr. Higgins.
To all of the witnesses today, I want to thank you so much
for your patience, for your presence and your patience. These
are very extraordinary times, and I apologize for the technical
glitch that we had. I am very cognizant of your time. We went a
little over, and I am just very grateful for your patience with
this process.
I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record statements
from the Detention Watch Network about ICE's detention policies
and operations; and National Immigrant Justice Center about
another ICE contractor, Immigration Centers of America, whose
facility in Farmville, Virginia, have further raised serious
concerns about its management practices in light of the on-
going pandemic; and in addition, statements* from family
members of those who have died while in custody.

Statement of Detention Watch Network
Monday, July 13, 2020
Under ordinary circumstances, Immigration and Customs Enforcement
(ICE) custody has proven to be deadly for the people detained at the
agency's network of over 200 jails and detention centers across the
country. Eighty-one percent of people detained by ICE are held in
facilities owned or operated by private prison companies.\1\ These
companies, including CoreCivic, the GEO Group, Management and Training
Corporation (MTC), and LaSalle Corrections, along with ICE itself have
proven time and again that they are incapable of providing the basic
care for people in their custody. Now facing a global health crisis,
ICE and its contractors' shameful record of medical negligence, limited
and rotten food provisions, poor sanitation, and demonstrated inability
to properly respond to infectious disease outbreaks is being
exacerbated by the COVID-19 outbreaks at immigration detention centers
across the country. These facilities are threatening the lives of the
people deprived of their liberty inside and the surrounding communities
outside. The only solution is to terminate these contracts and for ICE
to use its authority to release everyone from custody.

i. inhumane conditions
According to countless reports from advocates as well as the
Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General (OIG),
ICE already fails to provide the necessary conditions critical to
halting the spread of illness.\2\ After pressure from public health
experts and elected officials, the agency released a set of COVID-19
Pandemic Response Requirements in April.\3\ In addition to falling
short of the recommendations for ensuring the prevention of outbreaks,
the requirements proved entirely unenforceable. Immigrants in
detention, their attorneys, advocates, reporters, and Federal courts
now continue to report deeply disturbing conditions that further
reflect a massive failure by ICE to protect those who are detained, ICE
and contract employees working in the jails, and surrounding
communities.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Despite guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) and a broad range of medical professionals
recommending that people practice extra care in washing their hands,
using hand sanitizer and disinfecting surfaces, there are regular
reports of ICE failing to take these basic precautions inside detention
centers. In contrast with ICE's own policies and statements, access to
hand sanitizer and soap continues to be limited. In June, OIG released
a report detailing ICE's pandemic response thus far which included
statements from facility staff that they would be unable to adequately
respond to an outbreak and that they had insufficient supplies of hand
sanitizer, among other hygiene products.\4\ From mid-April to mid-May,
the Freedom for Immigrants hotline received 42 calls related to either
insufficient quantities of soap or a complete lack of access to any
soap.\5\ In June Freedom for Immigrants reported empty hand sanitizing
stations and failure to enforce use of masks at the Adelanto ICE
Processing Center (operated by GEO). People in detention also report
being given insufficient cleaning supplies--and in some cases only
water--to keep their living areas disinfected. Another primary
recommendation to slow the spread of COVID-19 is the practice of social
distancing, keeping at least 6 to 10 feet away from others. This is
impossible to comply with in ICE facilities where immigrants are housed
together in shared living quarters. For example, at the Joe Corley
Detention Facility (operated by GEO), a detained person reported that
people are unable to socially distance in medical isolation. In recent
weeks, there have been numerous reports of ICE contractors using toxic
chemical sprays at various facilities, including the Adelanto ICE
Processing Center (operated by GEO), leading to bloody noses, burning
eyes, and coughing, which could exacerbate the spread of COVID-19.\6\

The persistence of these poor conditions and ICE's failure to
provide information about the virus has led to mass protests by people
in detention demanding release for their health and safety.
Since March, there have been over 30 organized hunger and labor
strikes in facilities across the country.\7\ Instead of addressing
their concerns and engaging in releases as ordered by multiple Federal
district courts, ICE, including staff at privately-operated facilities,
has responded to protests by retaliating against those in its
custody.\8\ Guards have placed strikers in solitary confinement for
extended periods of time, barred them from communicating with legal
counsel and loved ones, denied access to medical care, and inflicted
serious physical harm. Reporters have exposed multiple cases of
facility guards pepper-spraying people protesting their detention since
the start of the National emergency, including the Stewart Detention
Center in Georgia (operated by Corrections Corporation of America),\9\
the Otay Mesa Detention Center in California (operated by CoreCivic),
the LaSalle ICE Processing Center and Pine Prairie ICE Processing

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The conditions and culture of cruelty are not unique to this
moment, but entirely characteristic of an agency and contractors that
are intent on terrorizing immigrants and should therefore not be
responsible for their health and safety.
ii. history of medical neglect and deaths
ICE and its contractors have repeatedly shown to be incapable of
adequately responding to outbreaks of contagious diseases and providing
the proper care for people in custody. Outbreaks of mumps, scabies, and
other highly contagious diseases have been documented to spread
aggressively in detention facilities. In October 2018, the Texas
Department of State Health Services reported 5 confirmed cases of mumps
among immigrants transferred between 2 ICE detention centers. By August
2019, there were 898 reports of mumps cases across 57 facilities, 34 of
which were operated by private contractors.\11\ This rapid spread of
mumps foreshadowed the vicious COVID-19 infection rate currently under
way and predicted by experts. As of July 8, ICE reported over 3,077
cases of COVID-19 among people in detention.\12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ICE and its contractors have proven time and again that they are
unable and unwilling to adequately care for people in need of medical
attention. Recent investigations into deaths in immigration detention
have found that inadequate medical care has contributed to nearly half
of all deaths in ICE custody.\13\ \14\ Since 2003 there have been 209
deaths in ICE detention, the last 2 in May for reasons related to
COVID-19 exposure in custody. ICE's refusal to mitigate the spread of
the virus by engaging in releases and subsequent willful medical
neglect is a ticking time bomb endangering the lives of people in
detention.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
iii. public health risk
ICE's callous behavior not only endangers the health and safety of
those it detains, but puts our collective health at risk. Facility
staff and people newly detained or recently transferred can spark
outbreaks by bringing the virus into facilities, while staff can also
take it back into their communities when they go home. In March, over
4,000 medical professionals warned that it would be just a matter of
time before the virus would spread throughout jails, detention centers,
and surrounding communities.\15\ These predictions have sadly proven
true. In Adams County, Mississippi, the rate of COVID-19 cases among
the general population is more than 40 percent higher than the National
rate, almost certainly because of an outbreak within the Adams County
Correctional Facility (operated by CoreCivic) caused by ICE's practices
being at odds with CDC recommendations.\16\

Detention officers working at the Otay Mesa Detention Center have
been driven to file lawsuits against ICE's contractor CoreCivic for
failing to protect their health during the virus outbreak.\17\ Two
guards at ICE's Richwood Correctional Center (operated by LaSalle) in
Louisiana have died after reportedly being told not to wear masks so as
to avoid spreading panic among those detained.\18\ Their relatives are
now falling ill, illustrating the danger that ICE's practices pose to
communities far beyond the walls of its jails and prisons.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
iv. transfers and profit motive
Despite the pandemic, ICE continues to transfer people between
facilities, knowing the very clear risks of spreading the virus among
detained people, staff, and surrounding communities in the process. As
noted above, the agency has ignored a multitude of court orders
favoring release to mitigate the spread of the virus and protect
particularly vulnerable individuals, instead choosing to transfer
people between facilities to feign population reductions. In April ICE
transferred 71 people from facilities in New York and Pennsylvania
where there were COVID-19 outbreaks to Prairieland Detention Center
(operated by LaSalle) in Alvarado, Texas where there were few confirmed
cases. Within 2 weeks, the number of confirmed cases at Prairieland was
at 41, with more than half of those being people who had been
transferred from New York and Pennsylvania.\19\ Despite these earlier
occurrences, ICE continues to regularly transfer people from facilities
with high incidents of confirmed COVID-19 cases to facilities with no
confirmed cases. In fact, transfers have led to outbreaks in facilities
in Texas, Ohio, Florida, Mississippi, and Louisiana.\20\ In one of many
examples, on May 18 ICE transferred 9 people from the Stewart Detention
Center (operated by CoreCivic) in Lumpkin, Georgia where there were 16
confirmed cases of COVID-19 to River Correctional Center (operated by
LaSalle) in Ferriday, Louisiana where there were no confirmed
cases.\21\

www.freedomforimmigrants.org/covid19.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Transfers have also continued from the criminal legal system,
despite the pandemic.\22\ Instead of releasing people who have
completed their criminal sentences to safely social distance with their
families, ICE is continuing to initiate transfers from State and local
jails and prisons. Since March, over 250 people have been transferred
from California State prisons to the Otay Mesa Detention Center
(operated by CoreCivic). At least 3 of those people were confirmed to
have COVID-19.\23\

www.kpbs.org/news/2020/jul/06/lawmakers-ask-newsom-stop-transferring-
people-/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another motive behind transfers has been to increase the number of
detained people at privately-operated facilities. Currently there are
over 22,000 people detained by ICE. This number represents a
significant drop since the pandemic first started in March, mainly due
to the administration's effective closure of the border and continued
deportations. Despite the very real danger of spreading COVID-19 among
detained people, staff, and surrounding communities, private prison
companies have been quietly trying to recoup their profits and increase
the numbers of people in custody through transfers from other ICE
facilities and from the criminal legal system in order to protect their
bottom line, putting their profits before the public health.
On March 31, 2020 the Management Training Corporation (MTC) sent a
notice to Otero County, indicating the company's intent to terminate
its contract for the operation of the Otero County Processing Center
(OCPC) due to the decreased detention population. In the letter, MTC
expressed its willingness to rescind the notice if the detained
population were to increase. In fact they offered their assistance in
increasing the population, ``MTC would be happy to explore with you the
possibility of partnering with other State or Federal agencies to co-
locate detainees or inmates at the OCPC in order to increase the
overall population at the facility and make MTC's continued operation
of the facility financially viable.''\24\ OCPC has one of the highest
COVID-19 infection rates among detention centers.\25\ Increasing the
population would certainly lead to even higher infection rates both
inside the facility and in the surrounding community.

Similarly, both LaSalle \26\ and CoreCivic \27\ have threatened to

an increase in the fees collected per detained person to make up for
the decrease in population.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
iv. solution
Communities across the country have witnessed the devastating
impacts of immigration detention for decades. We understand that the
experience of ICE detention is mirrored and in many ways exacerbated on
a greater scale for those incarcerated by the Bureau of Prisons, also a
subject of this hearing. ICE detention is a piece of the greater prison
industrial complex that remains rooted in racialized oppression. Now
facing a global pandemic, the lives of everyone in custody are in even
more jeopardy. It's clear that more resources for or dependence on ICE,
an agency that is not intended to provide medical care or respond to
health needs, is not the solution. There are no real best practices for
confinement that will ensure the health and safety of everyone in
custody, so instead we must listen to the doctors, advocates, and
Government officials that have been sounding the alarm for months now.
ICE must cease enforcement operations, end its contracts with private
prison companies, and immediately use its authority to release all
people in detention--for their sake and for ours.

Statement of the National Immigrant Justice Center (NIJC)
July 13, 2020
The National Immigrant Justice Center (NIJC) submits this statement
to the subcommittee on the response of ICE contractors to the COVID-19
pandemic, with specific focus on the company Immigration Centers of
America (ICA), which operates the ICE detention facility in Farmville,
Virginia. This facility currently has more than 260 reported active
cases of COVID-19, and for months people inside and family members have
been demanding the urgent release of their loved ones.\1\ People
detained have reported that, in response to hunker strikes and demands
for proper health care, guards in the facility have responded with
pepper spray and retaliatory measures.\2\ Further, as the coronavirus
is spreading in the facility, the company is pursuing new ICE contracts
in new regions.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
While the U.S. immigration private detention industry is dominated
by notorious companies such as GEO Group and CoreCivic,\3\ another
company, ICA, has a dark history of neglectful practices, and is
aggressively pursuing new ICE contracts in new regions.\4\ Since ICA
began detaining people for ICE in 2010, they have been the target of
several lawsuits and an investigation by the DHS Office of Civil Rights
and Civil Liberties (CRCL).\5\ In spite of this, ICA has pursued ICE
contracts in efforts to expand across the upper Midwest, in
Wisconsin,\6\ Michigan,\7\ Illinois,\8\ and in Maryland.\9\ ICA even
advanced its plan for a new facility in Maryland during the height of
the pandemic, when town commissioners voted to approve an ordinance
allowing for a new ICE detention facility in Sudlersville, Queen Anne's
County.\10\

immigration centers of america's response to covid-19
A recent spike in COVID-19 cases in ICA-Farmville has raised new
concerns about safety and about the facility's management. In April
2020, community groups and family members raised alarm about dangerous
conditions in the detention facility, as at least 100 people inside
took up a hunger strike over fears of a COVID-19 outbreak.\11\ The
hunger strike was cut short, however, when, according to local
advocates, officials locked 2 organizers of the demonstration in
solitary confinement.\12\ According to inside accounts, ICA-Farmville
has placed people with COVID-19 symptoms in quarantine and moved people
to isolation. While officers use personal protective equipment (PPE),
no protection has been provided for those detained, despite being
unable to socially distance or protect themselves from the spread of
the virus.\13\

The number of confirmed cases in the Farmville facility jumped in
June 2020 after ICE transferred 74 people there from facilities in
Arizona and Florida.\14\ As of July 10, 2020, 267 people had reportedly
tested positive for COVID at ICA-Farmville.\15\ That number is likely
even higher, however, because of under-testing and under-reporting by
ICE. Those experiencing symptoms, including people with high fevers,
are reportedly being handed Tylenol.\16\ Reports indicate that people
are forcibly kept in dorms in close proximity with up to 100 other
people. People inside describe symptoms of fever, headache and

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ICE and ICA's response to the COVID-19 outbreak in Farmville is
reflective of the larger problems with the system of privatized mass
detention that profits at the expense of basic civil and human rights.
privately-run immigration jails routinely place human and civil rights
in jeopardy
ICA's attempt to expand to new regions is part of a massive
expansion of the ICE detention system, a sprawling patchwork of jails
and prisons that currently holds more than 22,000 people but held more
than 50,000 only months ago.\18\ The rapid expansion of the immigration
detention system in overcrowded quarters lacking sufficient medical
care has resulted in the spread of disease, well before the COVID-19
pandemic broke out.\19\ In June 2019, after ICA-Farmville suspended
lawyer visits in response to a mumps outbreak, immigrants detained at
the facility organized a ``meal strike'' in protest of the restricted
freedoms following the quarantine. Guards cracked down on the
protesters, using pepper spray and placing some into solitary
confinement. The protesters are suing ICE Field Office Director Russell
Hott and ICA-Farmville Warden Jeffrey Crawford over the incident.\20\

ICE's detention system is overwhelmingly outsourced to for-profit
prison companies such as ICA and local jails. As of January 2020, 81
percent of people detained in ICE custody Nation-wide are held in
facilities owned or managed by private prison corporations--a record
high.\21\ ICE and its contractors are notorious for abusive and
inhumane conditions and widely criticized for a lack of transparency
and accountability. For-profit prisons have little incentive to focus
on anything other than ensuring profitability for their
shareholders.\22\ NIJC has obtained documents through information
requests that shed light on the money transfer scheme between ICE, ICA,
and the Town of Farmville which illuminate how the company profits from
detaining immigrants.\23\ It can reasonably be assumed that ICA will
continue to be motivated by profit-driven incentives as it seeks to
grow its immigrant detention business.

immigration centers of america's history and attempted expansion
ICA, like all private prison companies, has a history of hiring
lobbyists and using powerful connections to promote its agenda to
expand to new regions. ICA hired consultants with Spotts Fain
Consulting in 2011 to lobby ICE to assure its Virginia detention center
reached its maximum inmate capacity.\24\ The company also got help from
the former Virginia Attorney General, Ken Cuccinelli, current Acting
Deputy Secretary of DHS, who used his influence to lobby ICE to get the
Farmville facility off the ground.\25\

Similarly, ICA hired the Annapolis-based consultancy firm
Cornerstone Government Affairs to lobby officials in Maryland to take
on the proposed facility in the Baltimore area. According to documents
obtained by NIJC, Cornerstone lobbyists then went to the small town of
Sudlersville in an effort to convince local officials of their

expansion undermines rather than protects public safety: community-
based alternatives to detention are cheaper, effective, and humane.
Proposals to expand private ICE detention serve no public safety
function. On the contrary, a reduction of the use of jails and prisons
for immigrants in favor of release and community-based alternatives to
detention would promote family unity, ensure fairness, and save
taxpayers millions. More people behind the bars of immigration jails
mean more families separated, life-long trauma inflicted on individuals
\29\ and more communities torn apart. The new detention beds envisioned
by ICA in Maryland and Michigan will largely correspond to ramped-up
interior enforcement operations. In its own Congressional Budget
Justification for fiscal year 2021, ICE states plainly that it wants
more funds for detention expansion because it intends to increase
interior enforcement.\30\ These operations will in no way reflect the
``public safety'' mission ICE touts.

A spectrum of alternatives to detention (ATDs), including release
on recognizance, parole, and the use community-based support programs,
has long existed as a better option to the mass incarceration of
immigrants.\31\ Evidence-based analyses of alternative to detention
programming operating in the United States and internationally
demonstrates that these programs are most effective when they are non-
profit operated and provide holistic case-management-oriented support
that recognizes the dignity and civil rights of each person
participating; when operated in accord with these best practices,
alternative to detention programs are more than 80 percent cheaper than
detention and support compliance rates of more than 90 percent.\32\ At
this moment, ICE is detaining nearly 22,000 people every day in its
jails and private prisons. Moves to expand this already bloated system
are an insult to our National values and to the taxpayer's wallet.

The National Immigrant Justice Center calls for an end to the use
of immigration detention. As a step toward that goal, we are
unequivocally opposed to the expansion of private immigration detention
centers, including those proposed by ICA. We urge the committee to
demand answers from ICA about their response to COVID-19 and to closely
examine the company's aggressive efforts to expand to new regions.

Questions For Damon T. Hininger

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Question From Honorable Nanette Barragan for George C. Zoley
Question. Rep. Barragan mentioned allegations that female detainees
at the LaSalle ICE Processing Center went several days without being
provided soap or other hygiene items, and at least 15 of these
detainees subsequently tested positive for COVID-19. Rep. Barragan
requested information describing the steps taken when a detainee raises
concerns about not having proper hygiene products.
Answer. We are unaware of any soap shortages at LaSalle. We take
several steps to ensure that each detainee has easy access to soap and
other hygiene supplies. First, our employees check multiple times per
day to make sure there is always soap available at each sink. Second,
each detainee is provided with personal soap supplies. Third, detainees
have been informed that they can ask any employee for additional
supplies, which are made readily available 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week. Detainees are frequently reminded that any concerns can be
addressed through several channels, including discussing issues with
dorm staff, at scheduled town hall meetings, via ICE's Detention and
Reporting Information Line, and using the facility's standard grievance
process.
Questions From Honorable Joe Neguse for George C. Zoley
Question 1. Rep. Neguse asked if GEO would commit to giving
detainees' families and lawyers 24-hour notice prior to transferring a
detainee. Rep. Neguse also asked about reports that detainees were
transferred from the Aurora ICE Processing Center to places such as the
Teller County jail.
Answer. Only ICE can release information about detainee transfers.
Federal regulations explicitly prohibit GEO from doing so:

``No person, including . . . any privately-operated detention facility,
that houses, maintains, provides services to, or otherwise holds any
detainee on behalf of the Service (whether by contract or otherwise), .
. . shall disclose or otherwise permit to be made public the name of,
or other information relating to, such detainee. Such information shall
be under the control of the Service and shall be subject to public
disclosure only pursuant to the provisions of applicable Federal laws,
regulations and executive orders.'' 8 C.F.R.  236.6.

Question 2. Rep. Neguse requested information about ICE policies on
disciplinary sanctions related to detainee cleaning tasks.
Answer. GEO follows ICE's Performance-Based National Detention
Standards (PBNDS), including those governing detainee cleaning
responsibilities and the mandated graduated scales of offenses and
disciplinary consequences. ``Refusing to clean assigned living area''
is one of the Prohibited Acts enumerated in Section 3.1 of the PBNDS.
Questions From Chairwoman Kathleen M. Rice for George C. Zoley
Question. Subcommittee Chair Rice requested that each contractor
represented at the hearing post a tracker on its website giving daily
updates on COVID-19 cases in its facilities.
Answer. The ICE Health Services Corps (IHSC) supervises the
provision of medical care at all ICE facilities, and directly provides
medical care to detainees at 5 GEO facilities. Information regarding
detainees' medical information is the property of and is controlled by
ICE. ICE posts COVID-19 data on its website at https://www.ice.gov/
coronavirus#wcm-survey-target-id.
Question 1a. ICE has publicly stated that it is expanding
voluntarily COVID-19 testing across detention facilities and recently
completed testing all individuals detained at family detention centers,
resulting in 55 positive cases at the Karnes Family Residential Center.
Is your company involved in or supporting this testing program?
Answer. Yes. GEO provides medical care and testing at most of its
facilities. ICE Health Services Corps (IHSC) provides medical oversight
at all ICE facilities and is solely responsible for medical care and
testing at Alexandria Staging Facility, LaSalle ICE Processing Center,
Montgomery Processing Center, Northwest ICE Processing Center, and the
South Texas ICE Processing Center. In all facilities, GEO collaborates
with ICE and State and/or local health departments on testing.
Question 1b. If yes, which of your detention facilities are
participating in the voluntary program? How many detainees at each
facility have been tested? How many detainees at each facility have
tested positive for COVID-19?
Answer. As of August 4, 2020, 3,437 ICE detainees have been
voluntarily tested as part of a saturation testing program (i.e., not
including testing performed during intake or ordered by medical staff),
with 216 testing positive for COVID-19. In many cases, the number of
positive tests for detainees who are voluntarily tested are similar to
or below the numbers of positive COVID-19 tests in the surrounding
community. For example, at the LaSalle ICE Processing Center, 0.1
percent of the ICE detainees tested have been positive for COVID-19. In
LaSalle Parish, Louisiana, 5.4 percent of individuals tested have been
positive.\1\ Further, the numbers provided below are for ICE detainees
voluntarily tested.

Positive.

Central Region:

Karnes County Family Residential Center: 67 Tested/11
Positive

Montgomery ICE Processing Center: 285 Tested/68 Positive

South Texas ICE Processing Center: 450 Tested/14 Positive.
Question 1c. How does your company work with ICE to coordinate and
prioritize COVID-19 testing?
Answer. GEO coordinates with ICE's Office of Acquisition Management
(OAM), along with ICE Field Operations and IHSC, to plan intake and
saturation COVID-19 testing.
Question 2a. When GEO identifies a COVID-positive individual
(either among staff or those held in the facility), what are your
company's policies to limit the spread of the virus?
Answer. Detainees who test positive are placed in medical
isolation. Staff who are confirmed positive are sent home, if they are
not already quarantining. GEO facilities follow guidance established by
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), IHSC, and GEO
clinical leadership. We also collaborate with State and local health
departments regarding management of COVID-19 positive individuals.
Question 2b. When were those policies disseminated to your
facilities?
Answer. Initial policies and procedures were distributed to the
field in early February, and updates have been provided as
recommendations were made by CDC, ICE, or State or local health
departments. On April 10, 2020, ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations
(ERO) issued its COVID-19 Pandemic Response Requirements (PRR), which
establish expectations and assist facilities with sustaining detention
operations while mitigating health risks. On June 22, 2020, the PRR was
updated to Version 2.0, with expanded guidance on operations and
compliance measures, management of suspected or confirmed COVID-19
cases, and visitation protocols. On July 28, 2020, ICE released PRR
Version 3.0,\2\ which identifies additional high-risk populations,
provides updated guidance on personal protective equipment (PPE) and
hygiene practices, offers additional guidance when transporting
detainees with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19, directly
references CDC guidance for individuals in medical isolation, and
includes an updated testing section based on the latest CDC guidance.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ ICE's PRR is available at https://www.ice.gov/coronavirus/prr.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 2c. Please describe the contact tracing you engage in.
Answer. Detainee contract tracing is conducted by the facility
Health Services Department in collaboration with State and local health
departments. Staff contact tracing is conducted as a collaborative
effort between the facility's Health Services Administrator and Fire &
Safety Officer, GEO's Human Resources Department, and State and/or
local health departments.
Question 2d. What is the primary form of isolating individuals who
may have been exposed to the positive individual used by GEO
facilities?
Answer. Facilities individually quarantine close contacts of
individuals with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19. If cohorting
of close contacts under quarantine is necessary, symptoms are
monitored, and individuals with symptoms of COVID-19 or who test
positive are placed in medical isolation.
Question 2d(i). If cohorting is used, please provide the maximum
time frame an individual remained cohorted in each of your facilities?
Answer. Individuals are placed in quarantined status for 14 days to
monitor for signs and symptoms of COVID-19. If an individual is removed
from the cohort due to either presenting COVID-19 symptoms or testing
positive, the 14-day quarantine clock is restarted for the remainder of
the quarantined cohort.
Question 2d(ii). If no, what other forms of isolation and
monitoring do you rely on?
Answer. N/A.
Question 2e. Do you believe that cohorting is an effective means of
protecting more individuals from contracting the disease? Is it more or
less effective than other tools available to you?
Answer. Our facilities follow CDC guidelines and believe cohorting
along with other CDC guidance are the most effective tools to mitigate
the spread of COVID-19.
Question 3a. What additional steps has your company taken to reduce
the risk of COVID-19 at detention facilities beyond those taken or
recommended by ICE?
Answer. In February, well before a pandemic event was declared, GEO
began preemptive measures to prepare our facilities. Utilizing CDC
direction and guidance, we enhanced sanitation methods, identified
supply chains for PPE, provided COVID-19 training, and developed
prevention teams to determine individual facility needs. GEO leadership
established weekly calls involving corporate and regional leadership to
discuss current trends and recommended adjustments to facility response
plans to mitigate the spread of the virus. As the impact of the
pandemic intensified, weekly calls and team meetings increased in
frequency to occur daily. Additional facility-wide testing plans were
developed and implemented in conjunction with ICE and local health
departments to assist in identification of asymptomatic cases.
Question 3b. How have procedures been adjusted in light of the
rapid increase in infections over the past 3 months?
Answer.

In February, GEO focused on an awareness and education
campaign, providing evolving updates from the CDC to all
facilities highlighting the importance of social distancing,
proper handwashing, and sanitation practices. This information
was posted throughout our facilities, including staff work
areas and detainee living areas.

Knowing the retention benefits of repeated messaging, GEO
continually played educational videos on big screen TVs in
detainee living areas at all facilities. Additionally,
leadership staff conducted educational town hall meetings with
detainees and provided continued staff education daily at shift
briefings, as well as in all meetings with staff.

In February, through a new, company-wide policy titled
Coronavirus (COVID-19) Management, GEO's chief medical officer
provided technical direction outlining the treatment and
containment approach for COVID-19 based on the latest
information provided by the CDC.

A Pandemic Plan Template was disseminated to all facility
administrators who, by March 6, implemented it in their
facilities and began table-top emergency preparedness
exercises, even before there was a pandemic declaration.

Beginning March 20, daily Corporate Command Center COVID-19
meetings were conducted with regional vice presidents.

HVAC air volume cycles were adjusted to increase exchanges
above the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-
Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) standards for indoor air
quality. Air scrubbers were purchased or rented for specific
facilities with higher COVID-19-positive rates.

Facilities purchased additional soap, sanitizer, and
dispensers to ensure availability.

In March, GEO's corporate food service team negotiated a 5-
week on-hand supply of food at Single Source and negotiated
extending that supply for up to 3 additional months.

In early April, PPE, including face masks, eye protection,
and gloves, were issued to all detention staff. In addition,
all detainees were issued face masks in quantities sufficient
to replace used masks 3 times per week. To ensure proper PPE
use and care, training was provided to all staff and detainees.

As CDC updates and ICE's April 10, 2020 PRR Version 1.0 were
released, recommended changes to procedures were implemented at
all facilities. PRR Version 2.0 was released on June 22, 2020.
It was disseminated to the field and a follow-up conference
call was held with regional leadership to discuss changes from
the earlier version. This was repeated when ERO released PRR
Version 3.0 on July 28, 2020. Facility leadership regularly
conducts educational town hall meetings with all detainees and
provides continued staff education at daily shift briefings.

On July 1, a memo was sent to the field again promoting the
importance of social distancing. On July 6, we updated guidance
on isolation procedures. On July 14, updated guidance from the
CDC was received and recommended changes to procedures were
implemented. On July 16, GEO sent out an update regarding the
proper use of PPE, and we sent out an updated visitor screening
tool on July 17. A new contact tracing log was also provided to
the field in July.
Question 3c. What are the principal limitations or additional
resources needed to further reduce the potential for COVID-19
transmission within your facilities?
Answer. GEO defers to ICE's determination of what, if any,
additional resources are needed to reduce COVID-19 transmission. GEO
works with ICE to obtain necessary resources.
Question 4a. The committee understands that due to COVID-19 many
scheduled inspections and audits of facilities have been halted. How is
your company working with ICE inspectors and contracting officers to
ensure that CDC guidelines related to COVID-19 are being followed at
your facilities?
Answer. GEO facility leadership and on-site compliance staff
continue to conduct regular inspections and audits and work with
multiple offices within ICE (e.g., IHSC, ERO, and the Office of
Detention Oversight (ODO)) to monitor conditions and ensure CDC
guidelines are followed. Further, GEO's Contract Compliance Department
provides oversight and support to facility-level compliance efforts by
reviewing facility audit results, identifying all audit tool questions
that may be audited remotely by compliance managers from GEO's
headquarters, and creating new audit tools to test compliance with CDC
guidelines and continual CDC updates.
GEO's Contract Administration Department has also worked with OAM
to provide a framework that guides GEO's support of ICE's COVID-19
response.
Question 4b. How many complaints have you received on the failure
to adhere to this guidance from employees, detainees, or third parties?
Please provide a breakdown on what those complaints consisted of such
as access to medical care, hygiene supplies, etc.

Eastern Region.--Broward Transitional Center (Broward)
reports 0 complaints related to failure to follow CDC guidance;
Alexandria Staging Facility (Alexandria) reports 1 employee
complaint regarding staff quarantine criteria; Folkston ICE
Processing Center (Folkston) reports 2 employee complaints
related to staff PPE use (same employee); LaSalle ICE
Processing Center (LaSalle) reports 1 detainee complaint
related to personal hygiene supply, 1 external complaint
related to attorney video call scheduling, 1 employee complaint
related to PPE use and chemicals used for sanitation and 1
related to hand sanitizer and suspending visitation; Pine
Prairie ICE Processing Center (Pine Prairie) reports 1 external
complaint related to attorney video call scheduling (single
complaint named both LaSalle and Pine Prairie); South Louisiana
ICE Processing Center (South Louisiana) reports 1 detainee
complaint related to personal hygiene supply, 1 employee
complaint related to staff entering dorms that are under
quarantine and 1 related to detainee transfers.

Central Region.--Karnes County Residential Center (Karnes
Residential), and Montgomery ICE Processing Center (Montgomery)
report 0 complaints related to failure to follow CDC guidance;
Joe Corley Detention Facility (Joe Corley) reports 1 detainee
complaint related to hand soap; Rio Grande Detention Center
(Rio Grande) reports 2 complaints from detainees related to
proper usage of PPE by staff; South Texas ICE Processing Center
(South Texas) reports 1 employee complaint alleging that
employees with high-risk medical conditions were being posted
in dorms.

Western Region.--Adelanto ICE Processing Center (Adelanto)
reports 3 detainee complaints related to social distancing and
sanitation procedures, 1 requesting to be tested for COVID-19
despite not meeting the medical criteria for testing, and 15
related to staff PPE use (11 from one pod on a single day, 3
from 1 detainee on a single day), 1 employee complaint related
to type of masks used by staff and 1 related to mask wearing
requirements; Aurora ICE Processing Center (Aurora) reports 24
detainee complaints related to social distancing and the
revised COVID-19 recreation schedule, 2 related to hygiene
supplies (access to hand sanitizer and soap quality), and 2
related to staff PPE use; Mesa Verde ICE Processing Center
(Mesa Verde) reports 3 detainee complaints related to bathroom
cleaning (all from same dorm on a single day) and 2 related to
hygiene supplies (access to liquid soap in bathroom and asking
for disinfectant to be kept in bathroom); Tacoma ICE Processing
Center (Tacoma) reports 1 detainee complaint demanding to be
tested for COVID-19 (facility was saturation tested).
Question 5a. ICE has committed to providing 520 free minutes per
month for each migrant in detention during the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, legal service providers report this policy is not being
implemented consistently. Some facilities are not providing any free
minutes, some are providing less than 520 minutes, and some are
providing a limited number of phone calls per week and preventing
detainees from rolling over unused minutes. I've also heard from legal
service providers that some clients are not being given access to free
phone calls to counsel on non-recorded lines. These calls are critical
for those in custody.
What is the free phone minutes policy within your facilities? Is
this being implemented uniformly across your facilities? Do your
facilities guarantee access to unsupervised communication with
attorneys?
Answer. Detainee phone service at all but 2 facilities (Rio Grande
and Joe Corley) is provided by ICE's contractor, Talton Communications
(Talton). An April 17, 2020 Talton email states:

``Starting Wednesday, April 22 we will be issuing 13 10-minute calls to
all detainees with active PIN numbers . . . These calls will have a 1-
week expiration. After the first initial issuance of 13 10-minute free
calls, this will continue weekly, on Wednesday, until further notice.''

As implemented by Talton, the unused portion of a free call is
forfeited if the call ends before 10 minutes.
Detainee phone service at Rio Grande and Joe Corley is provided by
GlobalTel Link (GTL), a GEO subcontractor. GEO and GTL modified the
terms of their agreement, with ICE approval, to mirror the program
implemented by Talton. Each week, GTL provides detainees 130 free
minutes; balances are reset to 130 minutes every week, so unused
minutes do not roll over. Per GTL, wall-mounted phones have a 20-minute
time limit, and tablets have a 1-hour time limit. As implemented by
GTL, the actual length of the call-in minutes is deducted from the
detainee's balance until the balance is depleted.
All facilities guarantee access to unmonitored legal calls with
attorneys.
Question 5b. Are your facilities requiring detainees to forfeit
unused minutes at the end of the month?
Answer. Free minutes are reset every week; they do not roll over.
Question 5c. How are your facilities informing detainees of the
availability of free phone minutes?
Answer. Detainees are advised of the free-minutes program via
notice provided during intake and posted in detainee rooms and on
common bulletin boards in the housing units.
Question 6a. Detainees at the Torrance County Detention Facility in
New Mexico were on a days-long hunger strike to protest horrible food
and their vulnerability to COVID-19 when guards reportedly corralled
the protesting detainees and then proceeded to pepper spray them. There
are similar accounts from facilities across the United States.
How many instances of hunger strikes in response to poor conditions
have your facilities encountered since January 1, 2020?
Answer. GEO does not manage the Torrance County Detention Facility.
Per ICE's Performance-Based National Detention Standards (PBNDS), a
hunger strike occurs when a detainee is ``observed to not have eaten
for 72 hours.'' There have been no hunger strikes related to conditions
at our ICE facilities since January 1, 2020.
GEO is aware of media accounts alleging hunger strikes and monitors
these issues in accordance with the PBNDS. While a detainee may use the
term ``hunger strike'' while rejecting provided meals, if the detainee
is observed eating food purchased from the facility's commissary, the
detainee is not considered to be on a hunger strike.
Question 6b. How many times have rubber bullets, pepper spray, or
tear gas been used by officers at your facilities against detainees
since January 1, 2020?
Answer. ICE's PBNDS prohibit use of any chemical agent other than
oleoresin capsicum (pepper spray or OC). GEO does not use either tear
gas or ``rubber bullets'' in ICE facilities, nor does it keep them in
armory inventory.

Eastern Region.--Broward and South Louisiana report 0 OC
deployment events. Folkston and Pine Prairie each report 1 OC
deployment event, and LaSalle reports 4 OC deployment events.

Central Region.--Karnes Residential and Rio Grande report 0
such events. Joe Corley and Montgomery each report 1 OC
deployment event, and South Texas reports 3.

Western Region.--Aurora and Mesa Verde each report 2 OC
deployment events, Tacoma reports 5, and Adelanto reports 12.
Question 6c. How many of these incidents have resulted in follow-on
medical care or hospitalization for people in detention?
Answer. Detainees involved in OC deployment events go through
standard decontamination procedures and are evaluated by facility
medical staff. Four detainees received additional off-site medical
care. Each returned to their facility the same day with no lasting
injury.
Question 7a. I was contacted by Young Anh, whose brother, Choung
Woong Anh, died by suicide on May 17, 2020 while in medical isolation
at the Mesa Verde ICE Processing Center in California. According to his
brother, Mr. Anh was taken to the hospital for chest pains 3 days
before his death. While he was in the hospital, he was tested for
COVID-19 and the results were negative. Once he returned, your
facility's doctor ordered him to 14 days in isolation. Mr. Anh's
brother reports that he was emotionally distressed by this, and that
his medical records indicated he was considered high-risk for suicide.
What was the basis for placing Mr. Anh in isolation? Please provide
any records documenting this justification.
Answer. Mr. Ahn was placed in a medical observation room within the
health services area following his return from an outside medical
consult. This placement is consistent with CDC guidelines for the
prevention and spread of COVID-19 and the PBNDS.
Question 7b. What evidence confirms that regular checks were
conducted to examine Mr. Anh's well-being during this period of
isolation? Please provide any records confirming that regular checks
were conducted.
Answer. Observational rounds were conducted in accordance with
ICE's established requirements. IHSC supervises provision of medical
care at all GEO facilities (and directly provides medical care at 5 of
them). Private information regarding a detainee's medical treatment
belongs to and is controlled by ICE.
Question 7c. Will you commit, on behalf of the GEO Group, to
immediately end Mesa Verde's practice of placing individuals with
documented risk of suicide into prolonged solitary confinement--
including for purposes of medical isolation?
Answer. We will continue to follow CDC guidelines and contractual
requirements, including adherence to the PBNDS.
Questions From Chairman Bennie G. Thompson for George C. Zoley
Question 1a. Congress has entrusted ICE with billions of taxpayer
dollars for its custody operations. Knowing that there have been
serious operational challenges at ICE detention centers for years, I
would like to understand more about how your contracts have changed in
response to COVID-19.
Has your company requested any contract modifications from ICE in
order to respond to COVID-19 in your facilities?
Answer. GEO works with ICE to expand its scope of services by
following CDC- and ICE-recommended COVID-19 procedures. ICE has agreed
to reimburse GEO's costs associated with providing PPE and COVID-19
testing for detainees. Although ICE also indicated a willingness to
reimburse GEO for other COVID-19-related expenses (e.g., additional
cleaning supplies, transportation, and medical consulting expenses),
GEO has elected not to seek reimbursement for these services. GEO's
cooperative partnership with ICE has made formal contract modifications
unnecessary.
Question 1b. If yes, what modifications were requested? How did you
determine that your company needed these changes? How much money have
you requested?
Answer. N/A.
Question 1c. What long-term changes, if any, do anticipate you will
need to make--such as additional staff or more space for detainees--to
respond to COVID-19 in detention facilities, and to what extent has
your company determined what these will cost?
Answer. GEO will continue to work with ICE on any long-term changes
to our contracts. We anticipate social distancing requirements will
continue; however, it is currently unknown whether additional detention
space will be required. While we anticipate additional staffing levels
will not be needed, we are prepared to address the issue as necessary
going forward.
Question 1d. How many of your ICE facilities have contractually
guaranteed minimums? To what extent are those minimums being met? Has
COVID-19 affected ICE's ability to meet its contractually-guaranteed
minimum number of detainees in your facilities?
Answer. GEO operates 11 ICE facilities with minimum population
guarantees. Given the necessity of social distancing during the COVID-
19 pandemic, ICE has mandated reduced detainee populations of no more
than 75 percent of capacity at all facilities and has further reduced
individual facility population percentages as necessary. GEO is unable
to comment on ICE's ability to meet contractual minimums.
Question 2a. One of the recommendations offered to ICE by medical
officials is to significantly reduce the populations in detention
facilities as a way to protect public health. On March 23, 2020, BI
Incorporated, a GEO Group subsidiary, was awarded a 5-year, $2.2
billion contract to continue operating ICE's alternatives to detention
program, or ATD.
Please describe any plans to expand any existing contracts for the
ATD program due to COVID-19.
Answer. BI Inc., a wholly-owned GEO subsidiary, was recently
awarded the ISAP IV contract, which allows for significant expansion of
the ATD program. ICE designed the contract to allow for sustained
growth. The contract assumes a population exceeding 400,000
participants, but currently serves 86,000 participants. Funding is the
only limitation to expanding ISAP IV.
Question 2b. To what extent can GEO Group accommodate a significant
expansion of the ATD program during the COVID-19 pandemic?
Answer. BI has the infrastructure, support staff, and manufacturing
capability to expand the ATD program and adapt to the COVID-19
pandemic. The current infrastructure includes 54 contractor-leased
offices, 21 government sites (BI staff co-located with ICE staff), and
104 technology-only sites (where BI provides the technology with ICE
performing case management). This infrastructure can accommodate over
100,000 participants. BI can scale the program further by expanding
existing sites, opening new locations, and implementing additional
remote case management services, in order to manage over 400,000
participants.
In March, ICE and BI responded to the pandemic by shifting all in-
person services to remote case management. Approximately 54,000
participants were transitioned through BI efforts, including:

Scaling-up its single-platform case management system;

Leveraging the BI SmartLink communications and support
application to maintain contact with program participants and
allow for video conferencing and secure messaging; and

Distributing the ISAP workload across over 580 staff members
to maintain coverage of all duties while relieving those
impacted by COVID-19.
Question 3a. On July 10, GEO Group provided the committee with the
COVID-19 testing logs for 6 of your facilities, including Adelanto ICE
Processing Center and Pine Prairie ICE Processing Center. These logs
are part of the reports your facilities submit to ICE. In those
documents, there is clear evidence of the comingling of COVID-19-
positive detainees with healthy individuals at 2 of your facilities.
For example, a detainee who had tested negative for COVID-19 was housed
in West 4B with at least 2 individuals who had tested positive for
COVID-19 at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in mid-June 2020.
Comingling goes against your guidance; ICE guidance; and CDC guidance.
Please explain to the committee why this co-mingling occurred.

Pine Prairie.--The Bravo Alpha range housed detainees who
had tested positive or were suspected and awaiting results. The
range contains 11 2-man rooms as well as 6 larger rooms that
can house up to 8 detainees each. Per CDC guidelines at the
time, only ``like groups'' were housed together, and the groups
were kept separate; Confirmed Positive and Suspect cohorts were
not mixed and did not have contact with each other.
While not certified as such, the 11 2-man cells on Pine Prairie's
Bravo Alpha range function as negative pressure rooms, giving
an extra layer of protection above and beyond CDC requirements.

Adelanto.--West 4B (W4B) is a general population pod in the
facility's West building that has been designated for use as a
``medical isolation'' area for confirmed positive and suspected
asymptomatic positive COVID-19 cases when all negative pressure
rooms are occupied (a practice specifically authorized by CDC
guidance). The pod has 16 4-person rooms and 2 8-person rooms,
with a total capacity of 80 beds. When W4B is used for medical
isolation, all detainees are single-celled, for a maximum
capacity of 18 detainees (i.e., one detainee per room/cell).
If a detainee arrives at the facility with a positive COVID-19 test
(verbal or paper copy) from another agency, a confirmatory test is
conducted during intake and the detainee is considered a positive
COVID-19 case until the result is received. While test results are
pending, newly-arrived, symptomatic detainees are housed in a medical
negative pressure room. Asymptomatic male detainees are housed in W4B
in 1-man cells/rooms if all negative pressure rooms are occupied or
until 2 consecutive negative test results are received.
While in W4B, each detainee receives individual out-of-cell time to
shower 3 times per week. Between each use of the shower, the assigned
officer sanitizes the dayroom and shower.
These procedures are in accordance with CDC guidelines.
Question 3b. Has GEO Group ordered any changes in protocols to
control the spread of COVID-19 among detainees and staff since these
incidents were reported?
Answer. GEO follows updated guidance from the CDC, client, and
State and local health departments.
Questions From Honorable Cedric L. Richmond for George C. Zoley
Question 1a. Please describe for the committee the reasons ICE
detainees are placed in solitary confinement inside your facilities.
Answer. Contractually, ICE mandates adherence and implementation of
the PBNDS, which impose the use of segregation for ICE detainees within
special management units (SMUs), which may or may not include single-
detainee cells. Under the PBNDS, a disciplinary framework is utilized
and, for various categories of disciplinary offenses, disciplinary
segregation in an SMU is authorized. Non-disciplinary placement in an
SMU is also permitted for detainees posing an ``immediate, significant
threat to safety, security or good order'' (administrative) or for
``protective custody'' purposes.
Question 1b. How many times has an ICE detainee been placed in
solitary confinement since January 1, 2020? Please include a breakdown
of the reasons for each solitary confinement as well as demographic
characteristics of affected detainee.
Answer. The number of instances in which detainees were placed in a
facility's SMU are reported below; detainees were counted multiple
times if they were assigned to the SMU more than once.

Eastern Region:

Alexandria--0 (does not have an SMU)

Broward--0 (does not have an SMU)

Folkston--54 instances (all male; 38 disciplinary, 16 non-
disciplinary)

LaSalle--203 instances (167 male, 36 female; 144
disciplinary, 59 non-disciplinary)

Pine Prairie--71 instances (all male; 35 disciplinary, 36
non-disciplinary)

South Louisiana--0 instances.

Central Region:

Joe Corley--1 instance (male; non-disciplinary)

Karnes Residential--0 (does not have an SMU)

Montgomery--202 instances (180 male, 22 female; 129
disciplinary, 73 non-disciplinary)

Rio Grande--13 instances (all male; 12 disciplinary, 1
non-disciplinary)

South Texas--444 instances (424 male, 20 female; 173
disciplinary, 271 non-disciplinary).

Western Region:

Adelanto--233 instances (173 male, 60 female; 139

was kept in solitary confinement?

Eastern Region:

Alexandria--N/A

Broward--N/A

Folkston--7.8 days

LaSalle--14.4 days

Pine Prairie--19.5 days

South Louisiana--N/A.

Central Region:

Rio Grande--8.6 days

South Texas--22 days.

Western Region:

Adelanto--21.7 days

Aurora--21.5 days

Mesa Verde--29.7 days

Tacoma--11 days.
Question 1d. Is there a process in place for challenges or reviews
of the decisions to place someone in solitary confinement? If yes,
please describe that process.
Answer. Yes, the PBNDS requires a SMU multi-disciplinary committee
(including facility leadership, medical and mental health
professionals, and security staff) to conduct an assessment upon
initial placement in the SMU and then weekly status reviews during
continued placement. Detainees may challenge placement utilizing the
grievance procedure mandated by the PBNDS.
Question 2. Last year, the Department of Homeland Security Office
of Inspector General reported that 3 GEO Group facilities were engaged
in isolation practices that ``violate ICE detention standards and
infringe on detainee rights.'' What steps are you taking to help ensure
that your facilities comply with the standards and respect the rights
of people being detained in them? On June 3, 2019, the OIG issued a
report titled, Concerns about ICE Detainee Treatment and Care at Four
Detention Facilities.\3\ In this report, the OIG raised concerns about
segregation practices at 2 GEO facilities: Adelanto and Aurora.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ DHS OIG, Concerns about ICE Detainee Treatment and Care at Four
Detention Facilities (June 3, 2019), https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/
default/files/assets/2019-06/OIG-19-47-Jun19.pdf.
\4\ Please note that the third GEO facility discussed in the
report, the LaSalle ICE Processing Center, was not noted as having
problems with its isolation practices. The GEO Group does not have any
affiliation or control with the Essex County Correctional Facility that
is located in New Jersey.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adelanto.--In ICE's formal response to the OIG report, ICE
states that the PBNDS allow for the use of restraints in the
SMU on a case-by-case basis.\5\ GEO staff at Adelanto have been
trained to use the minimum amount of force necessary under the
PBNDS and to resort to restraints only when justified by an
individualized determination of a detainee's security
status.\6\ ICE's response also notes that the recreation time
issue was also corrected and detainees in both administrative
and disciplinary segregation receive an hour of recreation
time, 7 days per week. In addition, detainees in administrative
segregation also receive additional day room time, 7 days a
week.\7\

Aurora.--ICE's response to the DHS OIG report notes that
security staff at the Aurora facility received refresher
training regarding the use of restraints under the PBNDS.\8\
On-going compliance reviews since June 2019 reveal that Aurora
staff are following the PBNDS as required.

Question 3. Are ICE detainees with mental health issues placed in
solitary confinement? If so, are they then seen by a mental health
professional while they are in solitary? How often are they seen by a
mental health professional while they are in solitary? What is the
average length of stay in solitary confinement for an individual with
mental health issues?
Answer. Pursuant to PBNDS requirements and GEO policy, a licensed
mental health professional interviews and evaluates all detainees
confined to an SMU within 7 days and at least every 30 days thereafter
unless more frequent evaluations are warranted.\9\ Detainees with
serious mental illnesses are provided weekly counseling to assess for
worsening symptoms or decompensation, and each detainee's mental status
is monitored to determine whether the detainee requires a higher level
of care or additional treatment (e.g., referral to a psychiatrist or
placement on suicide watch). A determination is then made regarding
whether continued SMU placement is appropriate given the severity of
the detainee's symptoms.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\9\ In accordance with the PBNDS, a detainee's general health is
evaluated by a medical professional prior to placement in an SMU (or,
if that is not feasible, as soon as possible and no later than 24 hours
after placement). This assessment includes review of whether the
detainee has been previously diagnosed as having a mental illness.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Questions From Honorable Al Green for George C. Zoley
Question 1a. In documents provided to the committee, the GEO Group
mentioned procuring its own COVID-19 test kits. Which facilities have
their own kits to test detainees?
Answer. Every GEO facility maintains an on-site supply of test kits
to test symptomatic patients. If a decision is made to conduct
saturation testing, additional test kits are shipped to the facility to
allow completion of the testing.
Question 1b. Who makes the decision on who gets to be tested? How
is the decision being made?
Answer. Individual testing of symptomatic patients is determined by
facility medical staff based on current CDC guidance. GEO's clinical
leadership works in conjunction with ICE and State and local health
departments to evaluate identified facilities for saturation testing
based on facility and/or community transmission.
Question 1c. Are positive test rates being tracked? If so, how does
this list compare with data ICE provides on its website?
Answer. GEO tracks all cases daily, including the number of staff
and detainees who have tested positive and negative, and who has
recovered after testing positive. To ensure accuracy and transparency,
this information is provided to ICE's on-site monitors per ICE
directive.
Question 1d. How are these infection rates informing your decision
making to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus?
Answer. GEO's corporate leadership team conducts multiple meetings
each week with our regional leadership to discuss cases at each
facility and to recommend changes or improvements to the plan of care.
Questions From Chairwoman Kathleen M. Rice for Scott Marquardt
Question 1a. ICE has publicly stated that it is expanding
voluntarily COVID-19 testing across detention facilities and recently
completed testing all individuals detained at family detention centers,
resulting in 55 positive cases at the Karnes Family Residential Center.
Is your company involved in or supporting this testing program?
Question 1b. If yes, which of your detention facilities are
participating in the voluntary program? How many detainees at each
facility have been tested? How many detainees at each facility have
tested positive for COVID-19?
Question 1c. How does your company work with ICE to coordinate and
prioritize COVID-19 testing?
Answer. MTC does not operate any of ICE's Family Residential
Centers. However, at Otero County Processing Center we have implemented
comprehensive testing in partnership with ICE. We are also in
discussions with ICE to expand testing at all of the facilities we
operate.
At Otero County Processing Center, we have tested all individuals
for COVID-19. In other facilities, we follow ICE and CDC guidelines to
test those with symptoms or with potential contact to a positive case
of COVID-19. As of August 13, 2020, we have administered over 2,000
tests at the ICE facilities we operate, and there are 22 active cases.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

ICE identified LabCorp as an approved vendor for COVID-19 testing.
We have also ordered testing machines for our facilities. This
equipment should be available by the end of August. Then we will be
able to administer testing more expediently at our facilities.
Question 2a. In documents provided to the committee, CoreCivic and
the GEO Group mentioned procuring their own COVID-19 test kits. Has MTC
procured test kits and begun testing detainees? If so, at which
facilities?
Question 2b. Who makes the decision on who gets to be tested? How
is the decision being made?
Question 2c. Are positive test rates being tracked? If so, how does
this list compare with data ICE provides on its website?
Question 2d. How are these infection rates informing your decision
making to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus?
Answer. Starting in March, MTC procured testing kits from LabCorp
at each of the facilities we operate. Since that time, we have
continued to utilize this company to provide our facilities with
testing support. Additionally, we reach out to local health departments
to ensure we coordinate our testing efforts with those departments. We
have ordered 4 testing machines for that will allow us to increase our
testing for COVID-19. The ordered testing equipment is slated to arrive
by the end of August. In the interim, we will continue to work closely
with vendors and health departments to procure testing kits for all of
our facilities.
Our MTC medical team, under the direction of a physician, screens
new arrivals to our facilities using the process identified by ICE and
determines if those individuals should receive a COVID-19 test. This
screening process involves checking for symptoms, including a
temperature check, and asking about known contact with positive cases.
Additionally, if an individual in a facility has symptoms or has
potentially been exposed to COVID-19, our medical team administers a
COVID-19 test.
All facilities track COVID-19 testing and provide a daily report to
ICE on active and recovered cases. ICE compiles the daily updates and
posts updates on its website. When an individual tests positive at a
facility, the facility also notifies the local health department.
MTC is closely tracking active cases, recovered cases,
hospitalizations, number of individuals with symptoms, and numbers of
individuals in medical isolation or quarantine. This data helps us
understand patterns, monitor a facility's response to COVID-19, and
implement more comprehensive testing practices in facilities with
active cases.
Question 3a. When MTC identifies a COVID-positive individual
(either among staff or those held in the facility), what are your
company's policies to limit the spread of the virus?
When were those policies disseminated to your facilities?
Question 3b. Please describe the contact tracing you engage in.
Question 3c. What is the primary form of isolating individuals who
may have been exposed to the positive individual used by MTC
facilities?
i. If co-horting is used, please provide the maximum time frame an
individual remained co-horted in each of your facilities?
ii. If no, what other forms of isolation and monitoring do you rely
on?
Question 3d. Do you believe that cohorting is an effective means of
protecting more individuals from contracting the disease? Is it more or
less effective than other tools available to you?
Answer. MTC's policies are based on the directions provided by the
CDC and ICE. Individual facilities also add additional policies based
on requests from their local health departments. These policies are
extensive. When a detainee does test positive for COVID-19, MTC's
policies include:

Isolating the individual, preferably in a private room

Identifying anyone who had contact with the individual and
placing those who were potentially exposed in quarantine as
well

Sanitizing the individual's personal space and any common
areas frequented by the person who tested positive

Providing on-going medical care to that individual and
requiring staff and those interacting with the individual to
utilize PPE

Notifying ICE and the local health department of the
positive test result.
This policy to isolate active cases, as well as potential cases,
was initiated in February, 2020, based on guidance provided by ICE. On
March 11, 2020, MTC activated an Incident Command System (ICS) and
notified each facility regarding the implementation of this emergency
response plan. The ICS team met daily to review MTC's response and
ensure that corporate policies and practices were updated based on any
changing information regarding COVID-19. The ICS team continues to meet
and adapt MTC's policies as needed. Each facility's leadership team
provided staff briefings and town halls for the detainees to
communicate any changed guidance.
Our medical team engages with a facility's local health department
to conduct contact tracing. When a staff member tests positive, any
employees who had contact with the positive individual are sent home to
quarantine. When a detainee tests positive for COVID-19, medical staff
work with them to identify their close contacts and quarantine those
contacts.
When an individual tests positive for COVID-19, he or she is placed
in medical isolation/quarantine. Individuals who are potentially
exposed to COVID-19 are also placed in quarantine. MTC makes every
effort to isolate suspected and confirmed cases individually. In
instances where that is not possible, MTC uses a cohort approach. This
approach involves cohorting suspected cases in one housing area.
Confirmed cases are cohorted in a different housing area. All
individuals wear masks and employ social distancing in these cohort
situations. Individuals remain in quarantine--either in an individual
setting or a cohort setting--until they meet the CDC-defined standards
for returning to the general population. When we quarantine individuals
who have potentially been exposed to COVID-19, they remain quarantined
for up to 14 days. In a few instances, that time frame has been
extended while waiting for an individual's COVID-19 test results.
In responding to this challenging situation, MTC relies on the
expert opinions provided by the CDC. In the CDC's guidance to
correction and detention facilities, initially provided on March 23,
2020, and updated periodically, the CDC has identified that isolating
people in individual rooms is preferred. However, the CDC indicated
that cohorting can be used when necessary. When cohorting is
implemented, the CDC stressed that confirmed cases and suspected cases
should be placed in separate cohorts and that masks and social
distancing should be utilized. We have followed that guidance.
Question 4a. What additional steps has your company taken to reduce
the risk of COVID-19 at detention facilities beyond those taken or
recommended by ICE?
How have procedures been adjusted in light of the rapid increase in
infections over the past 3 months?
Question 4b. What are the principal limitations or additional
resources needed to further reduce the potential for COVID-19
transmission within your facilities?
Answer. Additional Steps to Reduce COVID-19 Risks.--ICE has
provided extensive guidance to reduce the risk of COVID-19, and MTC has
aligned with this guidance. In addition to following these directions,
MTC has purchased COVID-19 testing machines and has added additional
disinfecting precautions such as assigning an officer to walk the
facility disinfecting frequently touched areas and using ultra-low-
volume foggers at Bluebonnet Detention Center and Otero County
Processing Center. We have increased testing efforts depending on each
facility's local health department guidance. To encourage social
distancing, we have implemented multiple changes such as serving meals
in smaller groups, limiting the number of people eating at a table, and
marking lines to display 6 feet of distance.
Adjusted Practices in the Last 3 Months.--Our experience in the
last 3 months is that we are actually seeing a decline in active cases.
As of August 13, 2020, we have only 22 active cases across the ICE
facilities we operate. In the past 3 months, MTC has continued to
adjust practices based on ICE or CDC guidance. We have also ordered
testing machines and increased disinfection practices in that time
frame, including the purchase of foggers at 2 facilities and an officer
assigned to spray high-touch surfaces. Finally, facility administrators
have worked closely with medical staff, and the medical team has
monitored for even the slightest symptoms, isolating individuals as a
precaution.
Limitations and Resource Needs.--This pandemic has required an
increased need to purchase a variety of resources. Despite the
challenge, MTC has successfully procured PPE, cleaning supplies, and
hygiene supplies. However, on July 7, 2020, LabCorp emailed our medical
staff to indicate that there was an increase in requests for COVID
testing, which would negatively impact their testing capacity and
turnaround time for patients. They asked all clients to reduce their
COVID testing volume by one-third. MTC responded by ordering testing
equipment, which is scheduled to arrive at the end of August.
Question 5a. The committee understands that due to COVID-19 many
scheduled inspections and audits of facilities have been halted. How is
your company working with ICE inspectors and contracting officers to
ensure that CDC guidelines related to COVID-19 are being followed at
your facilities?
Question 5b. How many complaints have you received on the failure
to adhere to this guidance from employees, detainees, or third parties?
Please provide a breakdown on what those complaints consisted of such
as access to medical care, hygiene supplies, etc.
Answer. An on-site ICE employee continues to monitor facilities to
ensure CDC compliance. In addition, MTC provides daily updates to ICE
regional offices. Representatives from ICE, local health departments,
and other Government officials have visited our facilities throughout
the pandemic to monitor the extensive precautions we have implemented.
Additionally, the ICE Office of Detention Oversight has conducted
audits of MTC facilities virtually and it is our understanding that
additional audits by the Nakamoto group are forthcoming.
MTC takes all complaints seriously and conducts a thorough
investigation of any staff or detainee complaints. The following COVID-
19 related complaints have been made in the MTC-operated detention
centers since January 1, 2020:

IAH Detention Center, Otero County Processing Center, and El Valle
Detention Facility have not received any complaints from detainees in
regards to COVID-19 practices. Some employees at El Valle Detention
Facility have expressed a desire for more N-95 masks. We shared CDC
guidance for when to utilize N-95 masks and ensured that they were all
provided cloth face masks. Medical staff and those working in
quarantine/medial isolation areas utilize the N-95 masks, as well as
other PPE.
Otero County Processing Center did receive a complaint from OSHA
indicating that masks are not clean, masks are re-used, and individuals
are not provided new masks. The origins of this complaint are unknown,
and OSHA dismissed it after assessing our response and the evidence.
Individuals are provided clean, washable masks. Individuals can receive
new masks whenever needed.
Question 6a. ICE has committed to providing 520 free minutes per
month for each migrant in detention during the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, legal service providers report this policy is not being
implemented consistently. Some facilities are not providing any free
minutes, some are providing less than 520 minutes, and some are
providing a limited number of phone calls per week and preventing
detainees from rolling over unused minutes. I've also heard from legal
service providers that some clients are not being given access to free
phone calls to counsel on non-recorded lines. These calls are critical
for those in custody.
What is the free phone minutes policy within your facilities? Is
this being implemented uniformly across your facilities? Do your
facilities guarantee access to unsupervised communication with
attorneys?
Question 6b. Are your facilities requiring detainees to forfeit
unused minutes at the end of the month?
Question 6c. How are your facilities informing detainees of the
availability of free phone minutes?
Answer. Imperial Regional Detention Facility, Bluebonnet Detention
Center, Otero County Processing Center, and El Valle Detention Facility
all use Talton Communications to provide phone calls to detainees, and
all detainees receive 520 free minutes per month. These minutes are
allocated on a weekly basis: Thirteen free calls are issued per week in
10-minute increments. The 130 minutes expire each week.
Detainees are notified each Wednesday via a voicemail that they
have 13 free 10-minute calls available due to the pandemic. A
memorandum was also posted in the dorms explaining to the detainees how
the minutes are allotted. This information is posted in English,
Spanish, Chinese, Portuguese, Turkish, Hindi, Zulu, and Vietnamese.
IAH Detention Center received phone services under a county
contract. In that contract, all detainees receive 500 free minutes per
month, starting midnight on the first day of the month. Individuals
cannot roll over unused minutes. Individuals are informed about this
phone access verbally during the intake process. This information is
also posted in each dorm.
All of these facilities guarantee unsupervised access to attorneys
through visitation, as well as unmonitored calls to a court or legal
representative.
Questions From Chairman Bennie G. Thompson for Scott Marquardt
Question 1a. Congress has entrusted ICE with billions of taxpayer
dollars for its custody operations. Knowing that there have been
serious operational challenges at ICE detention centers for years, I
would like to understand more about how your contracts have changed in
response to COVID-19.
Has your company requested any contract modifications from ICE in
order to respond to COVID-19 in your facilities?
Question 1b. If yes, what modifications were requested? How did you
determine that your company needed these changes? How much money have
you requested?
Question 1c. What long-term contract changes, if any, do anticipate
you will need to make--such as additional staff or more space for
detainees--to respond to COVID-19 in detention facilities, and to what
extent has your company determined what these will cost?
Question 1d. How many of your ICE facilities have contractually
guaranteed minimums? To what extent are those minimums being met? Has
COVID-19 affected ICE's ability to meet its contractually guaranteed
minimum number of detainees in your facilities?
Answer. This pandemic has impacted the operational costs of
facilities. MTC has used the Request for Equitable Adjustment process
for those costs. We are specifically tracking costs associated with
COVID-19 in the following areas:

Personal protective equipment

Facility sanitation/cleaning

Test kits/testing

Additional phone service minutes

On-site medical care and medical equipment increases

Ground transportation to/from quarantine locations and to/
from treatment facility when necessary due to COVID-19.
Since April, MTC-operated facilities logged on average $130,000
additional expenditures each month due to COVID-19.
Long-term, it is still unclear how COVID-19 will impact ICE
contracts. MTC will continue following CDC and ICE guidance, and this
guidance impacts virtually every component of operating the facilities.
Since the start of the pandemic, the guidance has evolved multiple
times. Implementing the changes requires significant staff resources to
ensure that changes are implemented effectively.
Currently, 4 of our 5 facilities--all except Otero County
Processing Center--have guaranteed minimums included in the contracts.
The 4 facilities with a guaranteed minimum are currently well under
that capacity.
Questions From Honorable Cedric L. Richmond for Scott Marquardt
Question 1a. Please describe for the committee the reasons ICE
detainees are placed in solitary confinement inside your facilities.
How many times has an ICE detainee been placed in solitary
confinement since January 1, 2020? Please include a breakdown of the
reasons for each solitary confinement as well as demographic
characteristics of affected detainee.
Question 1b. What was the average length of time an ICE detainee
was kept in solitary confinement?
Question 1c. Is there a process in place for challenges or reviews
of the decisions to place someone in solitary confinement? If yes,
please describe that process.
Answer. MTC believes that individuals should be placed in the least
restrictive environment necessary to protect the safety of each
individual. Solitary confinement or restrictive housing is reserved for
high-level prohibited acts that pose a danger to those at the facility.
From January 1, 2020, to August 7, 2020, across all MTC-operated
ICE facilities, 213 individuals have been placed in disciplinary
segregation for an average of 15 days. The majority of these
individuals identify as Hispanic males, which is reflective of the
population that resides in our facilities. In these cases, disciplinary
segregation was administered due to assault, fighting, weapons
violations, or a combination of multiple major violations.
If there is an incident at a facility, the facility must document
the event, and ICE reviews the incident. In addition, an institution
disciplinary panel (IDP) conducts a formal hearing. This panel can
impose higher-level sanctions for dangerous prohibited acts. During the
hearing process, detainees can request representation. Representation
is automatically provided if the detainee is illiterate, has limited
English language skills, or otherwise needs special assistance. The
facility administrator also reviews any actions recommended by the IDP
and can concur with the sanctions or modify them.
Question 2. Are people with mental health issues placed in solitary
confinement? If so, are they then seen by a mental health professional
while they are in solitary? How often are they seen by a mental health
professional while they are in solitary? What is the average length of
stay in solitary confinement for an individual with mental health
issues?
Answer. MTC does not place someone in a restrictive housing unit
based on mental illness. When someone is placed in a restrictive
housing unit for disciplinary reasons, he or she is assessed by a
registered nurse. This assessment includes a mental health evaluation.
If a detainee is identified as having a mental health need, he or she
continues with scheduled appointments with a licensed therapist. The
therapist can recommend alternate sanctions for a detainee with a
history of mental health. To further protect individuals, a follow-up
appointment with a mental health provider is made 30 days out for all
individuals in restrictive housing regardless of the initial mental
health evaluation.
Questions From Chairwoman Kathleen M. Rice for Rodney Cooper
Question 1a. ICE has publicly stated that it is expanding
voluntarily COVID-19 testing across detention facilities and recently
completed testing all individuals detained at family detention centers,
resulting in 55 positive cases at the Karnes Family Residential Center.
Is your company involved in or supporting this testing program?
Answer. Yes.
Question 1b. If yes, which of your detention facilities are
participating in the voluntary program?
Answer. LaSalle Corrections is currently implementing Updated U.S.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Enforcement and Removal Operations
(ICE) COVID-19 Pandemic Response Requirements (PRR) at all facilities
with ICE detainees.
Question 1c. How many detainees at each facility have been tested?
How many detainees at each facility have tested positive for COVID-19?
Answer. LaSalle has tested 3,086 inmates/detainees at our
facilities as of Aug 23, 2020. One thousand three detainees/inmates
have tested positive as of the same date. LaSalle Corrections is
currently implementing PRR at all facilities. PRR includes expanded
testing and saturation testing.
Question 1c. How does your company work with ICE to coordinate and
prioritize COVID-19 testing?
Answer. LaSalle Corrections maintains a COVID-19 mitigation plan
and continues working closely with the Centers for Disease Control
(CDC), ICE, and other Federal, State, and local agencies to facilitate
and refine our pandemic planning and response in confronting COVID-19.
The ICE PRR sets forth the highest expectations and significantly
assists detention facilities in sustaining detention operations while
mitigating risk to safety and well-being of detainees, staff,
contractors, visitors, and stakeholders due to COVID-19. The ICE PRR
includes testing of all newly-detained persons before they are placed
in general population.
Question 2a. In documents provided to the committee, CoreCivic and
the GEO Group mentioned procuring their own COVID-19 test kits.
Has LaSalle Corrections procured test kits and begun testing
detainees? If so, at which facilities?
Answer. Yes, Lasalle Corrections has access to test kits and has
implemented the protocols for testing at facilities. The ICE PRR
includes testing of all newly-detained persons before they are placed
in general population. ICE testing for COVID-19 complies with CDC
guidance.
Question 2b. Who makes the decision on who gets to be tested? How
is the decision being made?
Answer. Volunteer testing of asymptomatic individuals upon intake
is expanding to all facilities consistent with PRR. Individuals with
signs and symptoms of COVID-19 are tested in accordance with the
medical providers clinical judgment utilizing CDC guidelines. Testing
for COVID-19 complies with CDC guidance.
Question 2c. Are positive test rates being tracked? If so, how does
this list compare with data ICE provides on its website?
Answer. Positive tests are being tracked at each facility. LaSalle
Corrections reports all confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases to the
local ERO Field Office, ICE Field Medical Coordinator, and local health
department immediately.
Question 2d. How are these infection rates informing your decision
making to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus?
Answer. By utilizing the infection rate the following measures are
undertaken: Re-education of staff and detainees regarding basic
infection control tenets, enhanced disinfection practices, social
distancing, proper use and donning and doffing of PPE, ensure adequate
medical supplies on hand, co-ordination of medical guidance with
operations staff as regards to housing assignments, ensue proper
contact investigation.
Question 3a. When LaSalle Corrections identifies a COVID-positive
individual (either among staff or those held in the facility), what are
your company's policies to limit the spread of the virus?
Answer. LaSalle Corrections strictly adheres to isolation protocols
and CDC guidelines for detention facilities and for transporting
individuals with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Comprehensive
protocols are in place for the protection of staff and patients,
including the appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE),
in accordance with CDC guidance.
Question 3b. When were those policies disseminated to your
facilities?
Answer. LaSalle Corrections implemented our Pandemic contingency
plan in response to COVID-19, that includes screening, testing,
appropriate treatment, prevention, education, and infection control
measures. In mid-late February 2020, LaSalle Corrections instituted
intake screening and tracking tools. Our strategic planning ensured for
continuity of operations and a sustainable health care delivery system
within facility settings. We continue to work closely with the Centers
for Disease Control (CDC), Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and
other Federal, State, and local agencies to facilitate and refine our
pandemic planning and response in confronting COVID-19. Updated PRR was
disseminated to facilities in August.
Question 3c. Please describe the contact tracing you engage in.
Answer. Close contacts (defined by the CDC) of suspected or
confirmed COVID-19 cases are identified by interviews with the
suspected/confirmed cases, review of housing assignments, movements and
interactions with staff and detainees, as well as review of
transportation logs.
Question 3d. What is the primary form of isolating individuals who
may have been exposed to the positive individual used by LaSalle
Corrections facilities?
Answer. Individuals deemed to be in close contact with a COVID-19
case are separated and housed via individual rooms and/or cohorted
housing areas.

If cohorting is used, please provide the maximum time frame
an individual remained cohorted in each of your facilities?
Answer. If an asymptomatic individual is cohorted in a group
housing area due to exposure to a case of COVID-19, the
individual is cohorted for 14 days from the date of last
exposure. In the event another detainee in the cohort group
tests positive, the cohort time frame of 14 days is restarted.
Thus, the time frame for a quarantined group is a rolling
number which is dependent on the last date of exposure. Of
note, the 14-day period allows for the incubation period of 2-
14 days for the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

If no, what other forms of isolation and monitoring do you
rely on?
Answer. N/A.
Question 3e. Do you believe that co-horting is an effective means
of protecting more individuals from contracting the disease? Is it
effective than other tools available to you?
Answer. Cohorting appears to be an effective means of protecting
individuals from contracting COVID-19. It is one of many tools we have
at our disposal in the prevention aspect of COVID-19. The summation of
re-enforcing infection control practices, intensifying disinfection
practices and the implementation of social distancing all work in
tandem with the auspices of cohorting to prevent the spread of COVID-
19.
Question 4a. What additional steps has your company taken to reduce
the risk of COVID-19 at detention facilities beyond those taken or
recommended by ICE?
Answer. In addition to ICE PRR, LaSalle Corrections continues to
incorporate CDC's COVID-19 guidance, which is built upon the
established infectious disease monitoring and management protocols,
coupled with the rapidly-changing adaptations of State and local health
departments. Also, LaSalle Corrections continues our focus on
operational and communications planning, reinforcing hygiene practices,
intensifying cleaning and disinfection of facilities, and monitoring
for potential cases. Facilities also continue increased social
distancing through physical separation, having staggered meals, meal
locations and recreation times in order to limit large gatherings.
Comprehensive protocols are in place for the protection of staff and
patients, including the appropriate use of personal protective
equipment (PPE), in accordance with CDC guidance.
Question 4b. How have procedures been adjusted in light of the
rapid increase in infections over the past 3 months?
Answer. LaSalle Corrections continues to refine processes and
procedures and updates criteria for discontinuation of transmission-
based precautions utilizing symptom-based, test-based, and time-based
strategies. LaSalle Corrections adheres to ICE and CDC guidelines and
quickly implements updates to preventive measures as they are issued,
including on key issues of testing, PPE, social distancing and
screening.
Question 4c. What are the principal limitations or additional
resources needed to further reduce the potential for COVID-19
transmission within your facilities?
Answer. ICE maintains regular communication and provides guidance
and resources if necessary, to ensure compliance to best practices
established in PRR and according to latest CDC guidelines.
Question 5a. The committee understands that due to COVID-19 many
scheduled inspections and audits of facilities have been halted. How is
your company working with ICE inspectors and contracting officers to
ensure that CDC guidelines related to COVID-19 are being followed at
your facilities?
Answer. We are still subject to multiple levels of oversight,
including regular review and audit processes and on-site monitoring,
and there are ICE officials assigned to our facilities. Also,
facilities operate under Quality Assurance Surveillance Plans and
subject to ICE Contract Discrepancy Reports (CDR).
Question 5b. How many complaints have you received on the failure
to adhere to this guidance from employees, detainees, or third parties?
Please provide a breakdown on what those complaints consisted of such
as access to medical care, hygiene supplies, etc.
At the time of this inquiry, the grievances reported were as
follows: 20--Lack of medical, 17--Social Distancing, 11--Hygiene.
Question 6a. ICE has committed to providing 520 free minutes per
month for each migrant in detention during the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, legal service providers report this policy is not being
implemented consistently. Some facilities are not providing any free
minutes, some are providing less than 520 minutes, and some are
providing a limited number of phone calls per week and preventing
detainees from rolling over unused minutes. I've also heard from legal
service providers that some clients are not being given access to free
phone calls to counsel on non-recorded lines. These calls are critical
for those in custody.
What is the free phone minutes policy within your facilities?
Answer. Due to the circumstances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,
we have a requirement to allow each ICE detainee a total of 500 free
telephone minutes per month.
Question 6b. Is this being implemented uniformly across your
facilities?
Answer. Yes.
Question 6c. Do your facilities guarantee access to unsupervised
communication with attorneys?
Answer. Yes, as long as detainees and attorneys follow the proper
protocol.
Question 6d. Are your facilities requiring detainees to forfeit
unused minutes at the end of the month?
Answer. ICE detainees are provided 500 free telephone minutes per
month. Minutes do not roll over.
Question 6e. How are your facilities informing detainees of the
availability of free phone minutes?
Answer. During intake briefings and postings in all dormitories,
common areas, and phone banks. Also, detainee handbooks include
information.
Question 7a. In your testimony before the subcommittee you claimed
that there have been no instances of pepper spray use. Yet ICE and
other independent witnesses have confirmed the recent use of pepper
spray at your facilities. For example, the Catahoula Parish Sheriff has
acknowledged that pepper spray was used against detainees at the
Catahoula Correctional Center in May. ICE also confirmed the use of
pepper spray against detainees at your Richwood facility in June.
Given that the public record clearly demonstrates that your
testimony was not accurate, can you explain why you were not able to
provide accurate testimony to the committee?
Answer. I apologize and was not trying to provide inaccurate
information. I thought the question was pertaining to use of chemical
agents ``pertaining to COVID matters'', but realize the question was
phrased ``since COVID''. There were (3) uses of chemical agents
reported ``since COVID'' up until mid-July 2020. One was at Richwood,
one at Catahoula, and one at Winn. Two of these involved detainees who
were out on the recreation yard and refused to return to their dorm
when scheduled. The one at Winn involved detainees who were destructing
property and setting fires inside the dorm. These (3) calculated uses
of force were documented at the facility and reported to ICE. In
addition, all use of force incidents are reported to the Office of
Professional Responsibility for review.
Question 7b. Please provide a description of each use of pepper
spray against ICE detainees since January 1, 2020, including the
location, the justification for the use of force, and whether any of
those affected subsequently tested positive for COVID-19.
Answer. April 17, 2020 Winn Correctional Facility.--Chemical agents
were dispersed into building when detainees refused several orders to
stop destruction of property and setting fires inside dorm. Four
detainees were identified as having later tested positive for COVID-19.
May 3, 2020 Catahoula Correctional Center.--Chemical agents were
dispersed out on the recreation yard after detainees refused several
orders to return to dorm. Medical staff present and no injuries.
Detainees ran back into dorm as soon as chemical agents were dispersed.
Twenty-one detainees were identified as having later tested positive
for COVID-19.
June 22, 2020 Richwood.--Chemical agents were dispersed out on the
recreation yard after detainees refused several orders to return to
dorm. Four detainees from that dorm have been identified to have been
tested after this event and all 4 were negative.
Before authorizing the calculated use of force, a supervisory
detention official, a designated health professional, and others, as
appropriate, assess the situation. In all incidents referenced a
calculated use of force was necessary after detainees created a safety
and security hazard and refused to comply despite repeated attempts by
facility staff. Subsequent to use of force, medical staff evaluated
everyone who came into contact with the pepper spray and no injuries
were reported. All of these use of force incidents were consistent with
ICE's Performance-Based National Detention Standards.
Questions From Chairman Bennie G. Thompson for Rodney Cooper
Question 1a. Congress has entrusted ICE with billions of taxpayer
dollars for its custody operations. Knowing that there have been
serious operational challenges at ICE detention centers for years, I
would like to understand more about how your contracts have changed in
response to COVID-19.
Has your company requested any contract modifications from ICE in
order to respond to COVID-19 in your facilities?
Answer. No.
Question 1b. If yes, what modifications were requested? How did you
determine that your company needed these changes? How much money have
you requested?
Answer. N/A.
Question 1c. What long-term contract changes, if any, do anticipate
you will need to make--such as additional staff or more space for
detainees--to respond to COVID-19 in detention facilities, and to what
extent has your company determined what these will cost?
Answer. It is difficult to predict what the long-term effects of
COVID-19 will be as even the CDC continues to learn more each day.
LaSalle has obviously had to obtain large quantities of PPE and
increase the sanitation protocols as well as secure testing kits and
other necessary supplies. We will continue to evaluate the increased
cost and monitor CDC guidelines to determine if contract adjustments
need to be requested.
Question 1d. How many of your ICE facilities have contractually-
guaranteed minimums?
Answer. Six facilities operated by LaSalle Corrections maintains
contractually-guaranteed minimums.
Question 1e. To what extent are those minimums being met?
Answer. Most facilities have experienced reduced intake.
Question 1f. Has COVID-19 affected ICE's ability to meet its
contractually-guaranteed minimum number of detainees in your
facilities?
Answer. ICE decided to reduce the population of all detention
facilities to 70 percent or less to increase social distancing.
Question 2. On the Truth of Testimony form submitted to the
committee, there is a box that requests that witnesses list any Federal
grants or contracts related to the hearing's subject matter that your
company has received in the current calendar year and previous 2
calendar years. The form also asks for the source and amount of each
grant or contract. You stated that this provision was not applicable to
your company, yet our 3 other witnesses provided the amounts and
contract award year of their Federal contracts with ICE and the U.S.
Marshals Service as required. Please provide the committee with this
information as soon as possible. This should also include any amounts
paid to LaSalle Corrections by ICE or any other entity regarding the
operation of LaSalle Corrections immigration detention centers.
Answer. Intergovernmental Service Agreement (IGSA) Facilities
(IGSAs) are agreements between the Federal Government and a State or
local government to provide detention services. While Government-owned
or leased, these facilities may be operated by either local or State
agencies or by a private company in the business of providing detention
services. LaSalle Corrections is an established developer and operator
of correctional centers throughout the United States. LaSalle
Corrections provides corrections industry solutions to law enforcement
agencies, Federal, State agencies, and government municipalities.
LaSalle Corrections specializes in the management of prisons, jails,
and detention facilities, as well as inmate and detainee transportation
service and ensures for strict compliance to National Detention
Standards. LaSalle Corrections receives no Federal grants or direct
Federal contracts related to the hearing's subject matter. LaSalle
Corrections maintains operating responsibility for the following
facilities.

Question 3. News reports from April 2020 say at least 2 guards at
Richwood Correctional Center in Monroe, Louisiana have died after
contracting the coronavirus.\1\ Reports from early May say 107
immigration detainees in detention facilities across Louisiana had
tested positive for the coronavirus.\2\ Whistleblowers have informed
the committee that LaSalle has never provided this information to
staff. Has LaSalle ever informed its staff of this information? If so,
when, where, and how? If not, why not?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Associated Press, Two Louisiana detention center guards die
after contracting COVID-19 (April 29, 2020), available at https://
www.tennessean.com/story/news/american-south/2020/04/29/2-guards-ice-
jail-die-after-contracting-coronavirus/3052969001/.
\2\ NOLA.com, Coronavirus cases explode in Louisiana's immigration
lock-ups; What is ICE doing about it? (May 2, 2020), available at
https://www.nola.com/news/coronavirus/article_ae470c36-8c9f-11ea-8450-
af1b6c53da5c.html.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer. The ADA requires employers that obtain medical information
through inquiry or examination to maintain it in a confidential medical
file and keep it separate from the employee's personnel file. Employers
have been encouraged by the CDC and EEOC to question their employees
regarding travel, exposure, or symptoms related to COVID-19. Any
medical information disclosed as part of this dialog should be treated
as confidential. If a positive case is identified in the workplace, the
employer is encouraged to investigate the exposure of others in the
workplace without disclosing the name of the individual or any
personally identifiable information about the person. The
confidentiality requirements under the ADA do not prohibit disclosure
to State, local, or Federal health departments. LaSalle Corrections
provides education to detainees and staff with allowable information
and preventive measures.
Question 4a. Based upon information provided by whistleblowers, the
committee understands that the actual numbers of staff and detainees
infected with COVID-19 at LaSalle Corrections facilities are far higher
than reported to ICE or the public.
As of the date of response, how many staff and detainees have
tested positive?
Answer. As of Aug 23, 2020, our consolidated report of ALL
detainees and inmates held in facilities we operate indicates the
following: Inmate/Detainees cumulative with positive test: 1,003; Staff
cumulative 251.
Question 4b. How many staff are not working due to COVID-19?
Answer. Survey of units indicates approximately 72 staff out as of
mid-August.
Question 4c. How many employee deaths does LaSalle Correction
believe to be due to COVID-19?
Answer. We have no way of really knowing the answer to this
question and do not want to speculate as to what a death certificate
may show as cause of death. We are aware of 4 employee deaths
throughout the company that family or friends have indicated the
presence of COVID-19 at the time of their death.
Question 5. On March 11, 2020, the Governor of Louisiana declared a
public health emergency due to COVID-19.\3\ Whistleblowers have
informed the committee that Richwood management prohibited staff from
wearing face masks until the week of April 8; at that point several
detainees and staff were already sick with COVID-19. Why was there a
delay in allowing detainees and staff to wear masks?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ Available at https://gov.louisiana.gov/assets/ExecutiveOrders/
25-JBE-2020-COVID-19.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer. I am not aware of any prohibition, although CDC recommended
voluntary wearing of cloth face masks for the public on April 3, 2020
and IHSC guidelines on April 6, 2020 recommended cloth face masks for
clinical staff and non-clinical staff who do not provide direct patient
care. LaSalle Corrections responded to these recommendations with
prompt requests to vendors and handed them out as soon as they were
available to staff and detainees. LaSalle Corrections strictly adheres
to ICE and CDC guidelines, and quickly updates to those preventive
measures as they are issued, including key issues of testing, PPE, and
screening.
Question 6. Whistleblowers have informed the committee that ill and
healthy detainees have been held together in a variety of communal
settings, including when being transported and when waiting for
immigration court proceedings to begin.
What protocols exist to prevent this from happening?
Answer. COVID-positive detainees are not transported in the same
vehicle with any other detainee. All COVID-positive detainees are
housed in the same dorm or in single cells. All potential exposures or
fevers are cohorted and not co-mingled. Detainees going to court are
given PPE and hand sanitizer. Social distancing recommendations are
followed. COVID-positive detainees court is held in a completely
sanitized office with no other detainee in the area.
Question 6b. Are you aware of any instances of non-compliance
between January 1, 2020 and today? If yes, what has LaSalle Corrections
done to correct this co-mingling of ill and healthy detainees?
Answer. I am not aware of any co-mingling.
Question 7a. The committee has been informed that there have been
multiple instances in which detainees who exhibited COVID-19 symptoms
were tested, tested negative, and then were put back in general
population. Soon afterwards they wound up in intensive care in the
hospital with COVID-19.
How many times has this occurred since January 1, 2020 to date of
response?
Answer. This did not happen as described above.
Question 7b. What has LaSalle Corrections done to ensure this does
not happen again?
Answer. It is the practice of the LaSalle Medical to isolate any
patient having COVID symptoms until being seen by the provider and test
results returned. A patient that tests negative and is afebrile may no
longer need isolation. Exposure to COVID may happen at any time and is
not predictable. I am aware of one instance where a COVID-positive
patient was housed in our COVID-positive dorm. This case was sent to
the hospital ER for shortness of breath on 2 occasions and after
medical evaluation, he was returned to the COVID-positive dorm. As the
patient was without improvement, he was referred to the ER for further
evaluation and admitted to the hospital for pneumonia.
Question 8a. CDC guidelines state that, after being infected with
COVID-19, individuals should test negative in 2 consecutive respiratory
specimens collected at least 24 hours apart. If individuals are not re-
tested, they must be free from fever for 72 hours without fever-
reducing medication and have improved symptoms before they can return
from medical isolation.
Answer. Lasalle Corrections has followed the Center for Disease
Control and Prevention guidelines for issuance and discontinuance of
transmission-based precautions. There have been guidelines for test-
based, symptom-based, and time-based strategies. These guidelines allow
for medical professionals to determine which strategy is applicable to
a case, dependent on the patient's medical history and history of the
present illness (COVID-19). Over time, the guidelines have been
modified according to the latest scientific information obtained by the
Center for Disease Control and Prevention. There has been no issue of
non-compliance to my knowledge.
Question 8b. Are you aware of any instances of non-compliance
between January 1, 2020 to date of response? If yes, what has LaSalle
Corrections done to correct this mingling of detainees?
Answer. Not aware of issues of non-compliance.
Question 9. Between January 1, 2020 to date of response, how many
COVID-19 tests have been conducted at facilities owned or operated by
LaSalle Corrections? Please provide a breakdown between staff and
detainees and by demographic.
Answer. As of Aug 23, 2020, there have been 3,088 test administered
to inmates/detainees. There have been 251 staff positive as of same
time frame. I do not have demographics by facility but know that the
breakdown between our regions are as follows: West Region 876 tested
427 positive; East Region 2,210 tested 576 positive.
Questions From Honorable Cedric L. Richmond for Rodney Cooper
Question 1a. Reports have shown significant staff shortages,
particularly during COVID-19 outbreaks at detention facilities. At
Richwood, operated by LaSalle, guards have been required to work 12-
hour shifts, 7 days a week due to these shortages.
Richwood houses an average daily population of 600 detainees and
has at least 65 positive COVID cases among detainees. How does having
an overworked staff impact providing a safe environment for your
employees and those held in your custody?
Answer. Lasalle is very proud of the way our staff step up to any
challenge and work extra hard to complete necessary task to the best of
everyone's ability. Our staff take pride in providing a safe
environment for all those entrusted to their care regardless of the
situation.
Question 1b. What steps have you taken to resolve these staffing
shortages?
Answer. LaSalle is constantly recruiting additional staff and
detailing additional staff into facilities where necessary.
Question 1c. How many additional staff are needed to handle a
COVID-19 outbreak at your facilities, if any?
Answer. It would depend on the size and severity of an outbreak.
ICE has been very good about reducing the populations to allow for
adequate staff coverage where needed.
Question 2a. The committee has been informed that LaSalle
Corrections staff who have raised concerns about employee, detainee,
and public health at Richwood Correctional Center have suffered
retaliation.
Are you aware of staff who have raised concerns about the health
risks from COVID-19 at Richwood?
Answer. I am not aware of any particular concerns raised by any
staff but know that staff everywhere would hold the same concerns as
anyone in the general public about health risk associated with a
pandemic that no one has ever experienced before.

If yes, have any of those staff been fired or been compelled
to quit?
Answer. No staff that I am aware of have been compelled to quit nor
been fired due to expressing any health concerns. I have heard of staff
who chose to quit due to general health concerns related to this
pandemic. Especially some who either had other significant health
issues personally or within their family.

If no, will you pledge to investigate and provide a written
report to the committee within 14 days?
Answer. If I had specific information related to someone who claims
to have been terminated simply for expressing concerns about the
pandemic, I would be happy to investigate the allegations.
Question 2b. How many staff have been terminated or quit at
Richwood for any reason between January 1, 2020 to date of response?
Please include a breakdown of the reasons for termination or separation
as well as demographic characteristics of affected staff.
Answer. Richwood terminations or separations as of Aug 15, 2020 are
as follows:

Resigned 15 total B/F5 B/M4 W/F2 W/M2 H/F2

Rule Violations 5 total B/M2 W/F1 W/M2

Background Check 40 total B/F10 B/M18 W/F1 W/M5 H/F5 H/M1.
Question 3a. Please describe for the committee the reasons ICE
detainees are placed in solitary confinement inside your facilities.
Answer. Solitary confinement is a term that is usually used in a
correctional setting to imply some form of punishment. I am not sure
this is what you are referring to in your question. Detainees could be
placed in Solitary Confinement for violation of certain rules if the
facility administrator felt it necessary to maintain the safety and
security of the facility.
However, detainees could be placed in an observation room away from
other detainees if it was in their best interest as well as the best
interest of other detainees such as being COVID-positive. This
placement would not be in anyway punitive as they would simply be
separated from other detainees. Any seperation due to COVID would be
considered Medical Isolation.
Question 3b. How many times has an ICE detainee been placed in
solitary confinement since January 1, 2020? Please include a breakdown
of the reasons for each solitary confinement as well as demographic
characteristics of affected detainee.
Answer. I would have to be given a lot more time to come up with
this answer as every facility would have to go back through mounds of
paperwork to provide this answer. In talking with several
administrators, they felt the number placed in restricted housing due
to disciplinary would probably average 3-4 per month.
Question 3c. What was the average length of time an ICE detainee
was kept in solitary confinement?
Answer. LaSalle Corrections has established Restricted Housing
Units that will isolate certain detainees from the general population.
The Restricted Housing Unit will have 2 sections, one for detainees
being restricted for disciplinary reasons; the other for detainees
being restricted for administrative reasons. To provide detainees in
the general population a safe and orderly living environment, facility
authorities will discipline anyone whose behavior does not comply with
facility rules and regulations. This may involve temporary confinement
apart from the general population, in the RHU. A detainee may be placed
in disciplinary restriction only by order of the Institutional
Disciplinary Panel (IDP), or its equivalent, after a hearing in which
the detainee has been found to have committed a prohibited act and only
when alternative dispositions would inadequately regulate the
detainee's behavior. There is a sanctioning schedule for rule
violations. The maximum sanction for rule violations is no more than 30
days for all violations arising out of one incident. Again, in visiting
with several administrators they felt the average would be less than 1
week.
Question 3d. Is there a process in place for challenges or reviews
of the decisions to place someone in solitary confinement? If yes,
please describe that process.
Answer. In accordance with ICE National Detention Standards,
detainees have the right to appeal any decision of the Institution
Disciplinary Panel by following the Grievance Procedure within 15 days
of the notice of the panel's decision and disposition.
Question 4a. There have also been reports that people are placed in
solitary confinement due to speaking to the press about conditions at
facilities. For example, The Intercept reports that at least 5 female
detainees at the Irwin County Detention Center in Ocilla, Georgia were
placed into solitary confinement days after speaking with a
reporter.\4\ Is that true?

Speaking Out About Fears of COVID-19, THE INTERCEPT, Apr. 11, 2020.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer. No detainees have been placed into solitary confinement due
to speaking to a reporter.
Question 4b. How many times has this occurred since January 1,
2020?
Answer. None.
Question 4c. Please provide the committee with all documentation
related to each incident of an individual being placed in solitary
confinement due to speaking to the press about conditions inside a
facility.
Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
Question 5. Are people with mental health issues placed in solitary
confinement? If so, are they then seen by a mental health professional
while they are in solitary? How often are they seen by a mental health
professional while they are in solitary? What is the average length of
stay in solitary confinement for an individual with mental health
issues?
Answer. Detainees must be evaluated by a medical professional prior
to placement in a Restrictive Housing Unit (or when that is in-
feasible, as soon as possible and no later than within 24 hours of
placement). The assessment should include a review of whether the
detainee has been previously diagnosed as having a mental illness.
Nurse, doctor, or other appropriate health care professional will
visit every detainee placed in disciplinary restriction face-to-face at
least once every work day. The medical visit will be recorded on the
RHU Housing Record. The medical professional will question each
detainee to identify medical problems or requests. Where reason for
concern exists, assessments shall be followed up with a complete
evaluation by a qualified medical or mental health professional and
treatment as indicated. The mental health professional determines when
a detainee can be placed back in general population.
