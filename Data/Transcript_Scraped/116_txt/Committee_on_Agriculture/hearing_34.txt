OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARCIA L. FUDGE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM OHIO

The Chair. This hearing of the Subcommittee on Nutrition,
Oversight, and Department Operations entitled, An Overview of
the Farmers to Families Food Box Program, will come to order.
Welcome and thank you for joining today's hearing with the
Under Secretary, Mr. Ibach, President and CEO of the San
Antonio Food Bank, Mr. Eric Cooper, and the President and CEO
of the Mid-Ohio Food Bank, Mr. Habash. After brief opening
remarks, the hearing will be open to questions. Members will be
recognized in the order of seniority, alternating between
Majority and Minority Members. When you are recognized, you
will be asked to unmute your microphone, and you will have 5
minutes to ask your questions or make a comment. In order to
get to as many questions as possible, the timer will stay
consistently visible on your screen.
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for the
House Agriculture Committee's first hybrid hearing during this
unprecedented time in our nation's recent history. The COVID-19
pandemic has brought with it an economic toll that has left
millions of Americans jobless, and without the basic income
needed to purchase food for their families. More than 40
million Americans have applied for unemployment as a result of
pandemic related job losses. At one point, 40 percent of
Americans making less than $40,000 a year lost their jobs. In
my State of Ohio, SNAP caseloads increased by 21 percent from
February to May. According to Feeding America, which represents
200 food banks across the nation, demand has increased an
average of 70 percent.
Many have read the heartbreaking stories about the
thousands of people across the country who lined up for miles
to receive food, many of them people who had never experienced
visiting a food bank. We also heard stories about milk dumping,
and backups along the hog and poultry supply chains, forcing
farmers to make excruciatingly difficult choices. Congress
passed several bipartisan pieces of legislation that were
signed into law, and helped expand aid to distressed farmers,
rural businesses, and small towns, and provided food assistance
to vulnerable children and families. We can all agree that
additional help was, and still is, needed to assist our
farmers, businesses, and vulnerable people experiencing
hardship as COVID-19 cases continue to rise, and the economic
damage that comes with that. Today's hearing is focused on the
Administration's $3 billion program intended to quickly deliver
fresh food to those in need.
On April 17, 2020, Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue
announced the creation of the Coronavirus Food Assistance
Program, known as CFAP, to provide $19 billion in financial
relief to farmers, ranchers, and consumers. This includes $16
billion in direct payments to producers impacted by the drop in
commodity prices and the disruption in food supply chains. It
also includes the Farmers to Families Food Box Program, which
provides $3 billion in fresh produce, dairy, and meat product
purchases for distribution through food banks and other
nonprofit organizations. However, despite some reports of
nonprofits successfully receiving and delivering food to people
in need, including in my district, the effort is clearly not
working for everyone.
Since the Farmers to Families Food Box Program was
announced on April 17, several issues have been raised
regarding the program's implementation and delivery. It has
been broadly reported that the program fell well short of its
initial commitment to providing 40 million boxes of food to
food banks, churches, and other nonprofit organizations by the
end of June 2020. We have seen reports of companies awarded
contracts with little to no experience in the timely sourcing
and distribution of food, including nearly $40 million to a
Texas wedding planner. A contractor committed to providing
750,000 boxes of food. To date, it has distributed fewer than
\1/3\ of their promise. Our Ranking Member frequently complains
about what he sees as waste, fraud, and abuse in our anti-
hunger programs, but I would like to know if he is concerned
about the egregious failures in his own backyard.
Some awardees have no prior experience working with food
banks, or even wholesale food distribution. Other contract
recipients have reportedly spent money on lobbying and PR
instead of diverting the money into more food for the hungry.
We have heard about inconsistencies in the coordination between
distributors and nonprofits on the amount of food a nonprofit
can handle, resulting in food spoiling in 90 weather. We have
heard from food banks which have historically enjoyed a good
working relationship with USDA's Food and Nutrition Service
that there are no clear points of contact within the
Agricultural Marketing Service to submit complaints or ask
questions.
This Committee requested, and to date has not received, any
information on how USDA and distributors are tracking which
nonprofits are receiving food boxes. USDA has also failed to
provide sufficient rationale for how it determined regional
food distribution such that Puerto Rico is in the same region
as Pennsylvania, and the Virgin Islands is in the same region
as Maine. Nor has USDA responded to public criticism by
publishing information on how they are ensuring only legitimate
and experienced nonprofits participate in the program. In my
district in Cleveland, Ohio, our food banks and nonprofits have
the benefit of working with a seasoned distributor that has
served local emergency food providers for over 100 years.
However, if the stated mission of the Families to Food Box
Program is not being accomplished everywhere, either through
misspent funds, mismanagement, or inconsistent operations, then
this program is creating hardships instead of relieving them.
It is clear greater transparency and oversight are needed
to shed light on a program designed in the dark by USDA,
outside of the farm bill, in the absence of input from
Congress, or experienced agriculture stakeholders and emergency
food providers. A program intended to feed the hungry that
fails to operate consistently and equitably for all people
across this nation is unacceptable. That is not good
government, and only lends itself to fraud, waste, and abuse of
taxpayers' dollars.
Today's hearing is only the beginning. I intend to closely
review this program to ensure that it meets its intended policy
goals and operates efficiently for all those depending on its
promised success.
I will recognize my colleague, Mr. Johnson, but let me just
make this one statement, Mr. Johnson. Because we are in votes,
and a lot of things are happening, without objection, the Chair
is authorized at any time to declare the Committee in recess,
subject to the call of the chair. Without objection, thank you.

The Chair. I now recognize my colleague, Mr. Johnson of
South Dakota, for any opening remarks he would like to make.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DUSTY JOHNSON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM SOUTH DAKOTA

Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Madam Chair. Good afternoon. Of
course, I want to thank our witnesses on both panels for their
participation today. When Secretary Perdue announced the
creation of the Farmers to Families Food Box Program, I will
admit I was excited. This was a way to expeditiously assist
producers, some of whom were, as the Chair mentioned, plowing
over crops, dumping milk, because of supply chain disruptions,
as well as an opportunity to help consumers who had found
themselves in circumstances beyond their control, and many of
them in very great need.
USDA's promise to purchase fresh produce, dairy, and
certain meat products was indeed welcome news, and to date
their purchases have far exceeded their own goals. Since May
15, Feeding South Dakota, who I talked to just the other day,
has accepted 95,241 boxes. To put that into context, that is
more than 1.5 million pounds of food. These boxes have included
a combination of produce, fluid milk, protein, and mixed dairy,
and, again, my reports from the field are that the quality of
those boxes have been excellent. Almost 100 communities
throughout South Dakota have benefited from the Farmers to
Families Program.
Now, let us be clear, no program, particularly of this size
and scope, is ever without growing pains, and indeed I wrote to
the Secretary on May 22 to further understand some of the
things I was reading, and some of the things I was hearing
about. The Secretary responded, explaining everything from the
contracting flexibilities under the Federal Acquisition
Regulation Part 18, to PACA licenses to further awards, and I
thought it was instructive and important data. And here we are,
90 days after the initial announcement of this program, and I
get the sense that we are focusing more on the fault in details
instead of, at the same time, also celebrating the bold effort,
and largely successful effort to feed those in need. What has
been accomplished really is worthy of celebration, and that
would be true regardless of what Administration is in charge.
Farmers to Families works. It has been successful, and it is
doing exactly what it was intended to do, connecting farmers to
families in need.
But instead of applauding the efforts of the Department and
the Administration, we sit here--and, again, I get the sense
that we will be cherry picking challenges that certain areas of
the country have faced. Meanwhile, and of great concern to me,
the other part of CFAP receives almost no attention from this
Committee. On April 1, I helped lead a bipartisan, bicameral
group of over 140 Members urging targeted, temporary, and
equitable relief for cattle producers. And, from what I see,
and this has been consistent for weeks and weeks, there has
been no greater push for assistance than for cattle country.
But the CFAP Program still came up short, as producers who sold
livestock after April 15 only received a fraction of those who
sold thereafter. As the pandemic carried on, and the situation
deteriorated for pork producers, we followed up with other
strong, bipartisan letters urging support for producers who had
been feeling the economic impact of shrinking shackle space.
We appreciate the hard work of the Department, and I want
to make it clear that much of what I am talking about is not
USDA's fault. As Congress, we have failed to deliver the
resources necessary to properly aid our farmers and ranchers.
We had to fight hard for that $23.5 billion, and that was a
fight to back the efforts of those who are working so hard
every day to ensure our food supply chain remains
uninterrupted, and our store shelves remain stocked. And I
would like to remind Members, and those viewing at home, that
in the early days of the pandemic Republicans asked for $50
billion in dedicated agricultural funding.
My hope is that we can come together and fight for enough
funding for agriculture in this next package that is going to
need to come together in the next week or 2. We need to provide
resources to both extend coverage for our cattlemen who sold at
the bottom of the market after April 15, and our pork
producers, who creatively found markets for hogs, but many of
them, I am sorry to say, suffered huge losses to avoid
euthanizing their livestock. A hearing on that topic would be
very much welcome, at least by me.
With that, Madam Chair, I yield back.
The Chair. Thank you, Mr. Johnson. And, prior to
recognizing Mr. Peterson, I just want to make you aware that,
in consultation with the Ranking Member, and pursuant to Rule
XI(e), I want to make Members of the Subcommittee aware that
other Members of the full Committee may join us today.
I now recognize Chairman Peterson for any opening comments
he would like to make.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. COLLIN C. PETERSON, A REPRESENTATIVE
IN CONGRESS FROM MINNESOTA

Mr. Peterson. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you for
your leadership. Mr. Johnson, you as well. As we all know, the
pandemic has really exposed a lot of things in agriculture. Not
only in production agriculture, but also in the distribution of
food, and I hope that we are going to spend quite a bit of time
on this Committee following up on that, and trying to get in
position where we are not going to have this kind of problem in
the future, where we are kind of ahead of the curve, if you
will.
Mr. Johnson, I don't know exactly what he was referring to,
but one of my concerns--and I appreciate the money that's been
allocated out of the CCC, but I just think that this idea that
we are going to give more money to the CCC, where we are really
having no kind of oversight, no kind of involvement in it
whatsoever, is not a good idea in the long-term, because you
are basically taking the Agriculture Committee out of this
whole situation. One of the things that I am going to--hope we
can do is, as we look at ways to deal with these challenges,
that we make sure that this money comes out of the CCC to take
care of these challenges. I am all for that, but just to have
an open-ended check I don't think is necessarily a good idea,
and maybe some of the stuff that has happened the last couple
years is going to come back and haunt us. Even though it has
been a welcome thing, I understand that, and producers needed
it, but I am not sure this is the right way for us to go. And
we will have discussions about that, I am sure.
When I was back a couple weeks ago, I went over to my local
food bank, and I was shocked to find out that their caseload is
57 percent of what it was at this time last year. They are way
below what they were a year ago, and it has been that way for 2
or 3 months. And it is not only in my hometown, it is in that
whole area. And I said, ``Well, what do you think is going on
here?'' And he says, ``Well, we are not exactly sure, but maybe
it is the unemployment benefits that are being paid,'' which
are more than--the $600 is more than the average net take home
pay of people in my district. They get these $1,200 checks,
they get $600 unemployment. Maybe that is it, we don't know;
but, we need to look into why it is in our area we are down,
and why we have actually more food in there than they can
store, and then in Marcia's area, and places like that, we have
lines around the block, right? Marcia tried to get into these,
so we need to look at what is going on here, and why is there a
disparity between different regions of the country, and see if
there is something we can do to help resolve that.
In regard to this Food Box Program, I don't know if I have
a problem with this, but what I am concerned about is are we,
in fact, getting the best bang for our buck with this program?
And I talked to the Secretary earlier, Under Secretary, and
they are doing competitive bidding, and they claim they are
making sure that they get the best price, and we need to do
oversight, Marcia, to make sure that is actually happening,
look into how this competitive bidding is going, and how much
we are paying for some of these things, because my sense is
that you are probably getting a better deal through SNAP than
we are through these food boxes. I don't know if that is true
or not, but we need to figure it out, and need to take a look
at it.
The bottom line, though, I mean, we need to make sure that
people that are unemployed, people that are having a tough
time, have enough food to take care of their kids, that is very
important, but we also need to make sure that we don't have
bureaucracy getting in the way, or we don't have mismatches in
the situation. I was getting complaints from some areas where
they said they couldn't get the stuff they were buying from the
farmers into the food bank, and found out that there is some
kind of a third party in some of these food banks where you
can't actually give the money directly--or give the food to the
food bank, you have to go through this third party in order to
get qualified, and it takes 5 months to do it. Well, does that
make any sense, and is that something that we should take a
look at as well? I think the Department is doing as good a job
as they can under the circumstances. We are in a crisis, we
understand that, but let us take this time over the next few
months to look at what has been happening, see if there are
things that we can do to streamline it, and to make sure that
the taxpayers' money that is going into this is spent in the
best way.
On top of all of that, the talk about some people
complaining about the error rate in SNAP and so forth, I just
had my staff pull together information on the food bank system,
and in 95 percent of the cases these are self-certified and
really, from what I can tell, nobody is checking anything. If
people show up, then they get served. In a lot of cases, the
income limit, if it even was followed, is 200 percent or 300
percent of poverty, as opposed to 130 for SNAP, I guess that is
fine in an emergency, but does that make sense, for us to have
such strict rules on one program, and kind of have an open-
ended situation on another? I don't know. Maybe that makes
sense, but those are some of the things we need to look at.
So, with that, Madam Chair, I appreciate your leadership,
and look forward to hearing the witnesses' testimony.
The Chair. Thank you very much. I now recognize Ranking
Member Conaway for any opening comments he would like to make.
Ms. Schrier. Madam Chair? I apologize for interrupting.
Several Members of the Committee are not wearing masks. That is
required in Committee meetings, and it is a sign of respect,
and, frankly, as a doctor, it is a good health practice to have
a mask on at a time of a pandemic.
The Chair. If all of the Members would please wear your
masks? Mr. Conaway, you are recognized.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. K. MICHAEL CONAWAY, A REPRESENTATIVE
IN CONGRESS FROM TEXAS

Mr. Conaway. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you for holding
this hearing, which, quite frankly, is the first since March
the 10th for our Committee. In fact, the Agriculture Committee
is the last standing committee to have a hearing since the
pandemic started, and that is really disappointing. However,
based on my good colleague, the Chairman's remarks about need
for oversight across a broad spectrum of things, I am hopeful
that that gets translated into a lot more aggressive committee
activity so that we could actually get to the answers to the
questions that he posed. And, Madam Chair, thank you for
breaking the chain of no hearings for a long, long time, so I
appreciate that.
We are here today, well, some of us are here. The folks on
the screen over there, they are here as well, to--not to
discuss the litany of issues impacting farm country that this
Committee continues to ignore, but to discuss a program that is
popular, effective, and working as intended, a program that is
meant to supplement, not supplant, the vast nutrition safety
net that USDA is responsible for administering for our friends
and neighbors in need. Farmers to Families is doing exactly
what the Secretary wanted it to do, connect farmers with
families impacted by this crisis. This program not only helped
producers who found themselves in the middle of major shifts in
the supply chain, but consumers who fell victim to
unprecedented circumstances.
I am also frustrated with our witness list today. We have
two witnesses whose testimony is darn near identical coming
from backgrounds that are almost identical, from the food
banks, but we are not hearing from witnesses associated with
the hundreds of not-for-profits and community-based
organizations out there who have actually been in the fight
getting these boxes out to the consumers. I would prefer to
hear from somebody like that, as well as the folks that we are
likely to hear from. So, that said, I also appreciate Secretary
Ibach for coming, and I will look forward to hearing from Mr.
Cooper and Mr. Habash when they get here for their panel, but
our panel should have been a little broader spectrum for the
testimony today. So, with that, Mr. Chairman--Madam Chair, I
yield back.
The Chair. Thank you very much. And, for the record, you
had an opportunity to put a witness on this panel, and chose
not to do so. The chair would request that other Members submit
their opening statements for the record so witnesses may begin
their testimony to ensure that there is ample time for
questions.
With that, I would welcome our first panel. I thank you for
being here today. At this time I will introduce our first
witness, Under Secretary Greg Ibach. The Under Secretary was
confirmed by the Senate and sworn in as Under Secretary for
Marketing and Regulatory Programs on October 30, 2017. In his
role as Under Secretary, Mr. Ibach is responsible for carrying
out MRP mission area, which is comprised of the Agricultural
Marketing Service agency, and the Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service agency. He is accompanied today by
Administrator Bruce Summers. Sir, you may begin. You have 5
minutes.

STATEMENT OF HON. GREG IBACH, UNDER SECRETARY,
MARKETING AND REGULATORY PROGRAMS, U.S.
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, WASHINGTON, D.C.;
ACCOMPANIED BY BRUCE SUMMERS, ADMINISTRATOR,
AGRICULTURAL MARKETING SERVICE, USDA

Mr. Ibach. Chair Fudge, Ranking Member Johnson, as well as
the full Committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear
before you today to discuss the Farmers to Families Food Box
Program. I am Greg Ibach, the Under Secretary for Marketing and
Regulatory Programs in the USDA's mission area. With me today
is Bruce Summers, Administrator for the Agricultural Marketing
Service, the agency which implements the Food Box Program.
Before I begin, Chair Fudge, I want to thank your
constituents at the Cleveland Food Bank and the Sanson Company
for hosting me in Cleveland to discuss the impact this program
has in your community. We were also joined by Produce One and
Wiers Farms, two other local food box distributors, and the
Grace Christian and Missionary Alliance Church. I am pleased to
report what I saw firsthand in your district. As a result of
this program, the Cleveland Food Bank is delivering boxes of
fresh fruits, vegetables, dairy, and meat to 25,000 newly food-
insecure families. The Sanson Company hired, or re-hired,
dozens of employees, and the Grace Christian and Missionary
Alliance Church shared that distributing boxes to families in
need has given the congregation a renewed sense of purpose in
these trying times. Wherever I visit, distributors and food
banks share handwritten notes from families who consider the
Farmers to Families Food Box Program a lifeline during this
crisis. I brought several letters today written by families in
Cleveland.
Today, I would like to provide you with background of how
we formulated the program in its current status and next steps.
As part of the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program Secretary
Perdue announced on April 17, USDA utilized authority under the
Families First Coronavirus Response Act to purchase and
distribute up to $3 billion in fresh produce, dairy, and meat
products. The program supplies boxes packaged with fresh fruits
and vegetables, dairy products, meat products, and a
combination box of produce, dairy, or meat products. Local and
regional suppliers package these products into family-sized
boxes, and then transport them to food banks, community and
faith-based organizations, and other nonprofits serving
Americans in need. This multi-billion dollar program, stood up
in a short period of time, addresses three critical needs. One,
providing markets for farmers faced with declining demand, and
the crisis of food rotting in fields, and not being wasted.
Two, supplying food to newly unemployed Americans, and three,
utilizing the idle food distribution infrastructure. Employees
have been called back to work, and even new employees hired,
many of whom lost their jobs in other industries.
Applicants to the program had to demonstrate capabilities
regarding commercial experience, business ethics and integrity
standards, food safety and/or experience with regulatory
audits, inspections, certifications, and approvals, and
financial performance. The amounts and locations awarded were
based on the offers received, and the evaluation of those
offers. I would like to stress two important points. One, all
commodities purchased, packaged, and delivered are 100 percent
domestic origin, and two, no vendor is paid until proof of
delivery and compliance with the contract is confirmed.
Oversight of the program is ongoing. This program assists
in safeguarding U.S. taxpayers' funds and ensuring relevant
laws and regulations are followed. Audits are performed to
ensure that safe, high-quality, domestically-produced products
are delivered to food banks and nonprofit community and faith-
based organizations. Later this week USDA will announce an
opportunity for new and current vendors to submit proposals to
utilize approximately $500 to $700 million that will be
remaining when current contracts expire.
In summation, tens of millions of boxes have been
delivered, resulting in hundreds of millions of meals being
provided to Americans in need. As Secretary Perdue has stated
on multiple occasions, the program is a win-win-win. While the
feedback received by the Department has been overwhelmingly
positive, we are constantly evaluating program operations, and
inviting input to ensure the program continues to have the most
positive impact possible, as we at USDA strive to do right and
feed everyone. Again, thank you for the opportunity to be here
today. I am happy to answer any questions you might have.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Ibach follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Greg Ibach, Under Secretary, Marketing and
Regulatory Programs, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C.
Chair Fudge, Ranking Member Johnson, and Members of the
Subcommittee and full Committee, thank you for the opportunity to
appear before you today to discuss the Farmers to Families Food Box
Program (FFFBP). I am Greg Ibach, Under Secretary for USDA's Marketing
and Regulatory Programs mission area. With me today is Bruce Summers,
Administrator for the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), the agency
which implements the FFFBP.
Today, I would like to provide you with background on the
formulation and implementation of the program, the current status of
activities, AMS' contracting and oversight of the program, and next
steps.
Background
As part of the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program Secretary Perdue
announced on April 17, USDA utilized authority under the Families First
Coronavirus Response Act to purchase and distribute agricultural
products to those in need. Through FFFBP, AMS partners with national,
regional and local suppliers, whose workforce has been significantly
impacted by the closure of restaurants, hotels and other food service
businesses, to purchase up to $3 billion in fresh produce, dairy and
meat products. Specifically, the announced objective of the program was
to purchase an estimated $100 million per month in fresh fruits and
vegetables, $100 million per month in a variety of dairy products, and
$100 million per month in meat products. The program supplies boxes
packaged with fresh fruits and vegetables, dairy products, meat
products and a combination box of fresh produce, dairy or meat
products. Suppliers package these products into family-sized boxes,
then transport them to food banks, community and faith-based
organizations, and other nonprofits serving Americans in need.
In just a few short weeks, USDA stood up FFFBP as a new and
innovative multi-billion-dollar COVID response program to address three
critical needs simultaneously: to provide markets for farmers faced
with declining demand and the crisis of food rotting in fields and
animals being euthanized; the food needs of newly unemployed Americans;
and helping put suppliers and distributors back to work. I would like
to stress two important points: all commodities purchased, packaged,
and delivered are of 100 percent domestic origin and no vendor is paid
until proof of delivery and compliance with the contract is confirmed.
Current Status
The first round of purchases, for which $1.2 billion was allocated,
occurred from May 15 through June 30, 2020. USDA received approximately
550 bids and awarded 198 contracts just 1 week after the bids were due.
During this first round, 35.5 million food boxes were delivered to over
10,000 nonprofit organizations across the United States including Guam,
and Puerto Rico. These boxes provided hundreds of millions of meals to
needy Americans.
On July 1, 2020, USDA announced the approval up to $1.27 billion in
189 extended contracts and up to $218 million in 17 new contracts to
support American producers and communities. In this second round of
purchases, the program will purchase $523 million in fresh fruits and
vegetables, $288 million in a variety of dairy products, $233 million
in meat products and $444 million in a combination box of fresh
produce, dairy or meat products.
As a part of the original request for proposal, USDA provided an
option for vendors to offer delivery of boxes from July 1-Aug[.] 30.
USDA exercised this option for the next performance period, however,
vendor performance was critical to receiving a contract extension.
Evaluation criteria for contract extensions included successful
delivery of promised boxes, product quality, and safety, among other
factors. Additionally, some contracts were not extended at the vendors'
request or reduced based on information provided by the contractor.
USDA approved up to $218 million in new contracts, via a new
acquisition activity, with select vendors whose offers were not
previously accepted due to various issues in their proposals. These
distributors will help direct food to under-served areas and will have
an increased focus on Opportunity Zones in order to direct food to
reach under-served areas, places where either no boxes have yet been
delivered, or where boxes are being delivered, but where there is
additional need. A full, updated, list of current suppliers is
available on the AMS website.
As of July 17, 2020, 43.5 million food boxes have been invoiced.
In addition, a survey was conducted during the week of June 22-26,
2020, of contractors participating in the program focused on the impact
of their ability to retain, recall, or hire employees and on the extent
FFFB[P] helped to offset losses caused by COVID-19 mitigation efforts.
Approximately 70 percent of the contractors provided feedback on a
series of questions.
Responders were asked to rate the impact of the program on their
company using a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 having no impact and 10 having
the greatest impact. All 135 responders provided feedback with just
over half (55 percent) giving the program the maximum rating of 10.
Fully 85 percent rated the program as 8 or higher with 13 percent
scoring it between 5 and 7 and just over one percent rating the program
less than 3.
Another question sought to gauge the effect of FFFBP on the
contractor's ability to avoid furloughs, layoffs, or other such
actions. Of the 100 responses received, 72 percent indicated that FFFBP
did have a positive effect on their ability to retain staff.
Respondents collectively identified that they either retained or
created over 5,000 jobs.
When asked if their participation in FFFBP helped them to offset
losses caused by COVID-19 mitigation efforts, of the 135 who responded,
95 percent said that it did. Of those surveyed, 96 percent indicated
that participation in FFFBP helped them to form new relationships with
nonprofit, community organizations, or religious organizations with the
same percentage indicating that they intend to maintain these new
relationships.
Contracting and Oversight
Utilizing contracting flexibilities provided by Federal Acquisition
Regulation (FAR) Part 18 during an emergency declaration, USDA designed
a process to rapidly vet and approve contractors to participate in the
program. The vetting process relied on answers to a Request for
Proposals. Offerors described the capabilities they had for achieving
performance under the contract.
Like other Federal contracts administered by USDA, FFFBP and its
awardees must adhere to FAR and other regulations. All proposals were
carefully reviewed by a team of approximately 18 contracting and
technical experts, and contracts were made accordingly. Proposals for
the FFFBP were evaluated by (in descending order of importance) the
technical information; past performance of the offeror; the offeror's
capability to perform; and the prices offered. The requirement of the
RFP was to submit a price per box to the government, which was all
inclusive, including product, boxes, assembly of the boxes, and
transportation to the distribution site. Prices were evaluated in
accordance with contracting regulations to ensure fair and reasonable
pricing. Prices per box varies based on size and contents, but the
average value is approximately $30 per box. Offerors must have met all
criteria in order to be competitive and must have, or be able to
acquire, a Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA) license to
comply with the contractual requirement. All current contractors have
valid PACA licenses.
As part of the proposal, applicants described their capabilities
for achieving performance under the contract. Demonstrations of this
capability included, but were not limited to, commercial experience;
business ethics and integrity standards; food safety and/or regulatory
audits, inspections, certifications and approvals; and a demonstration
of financial capability to perform. Each vendor awarded a contract
provided three past performance references for similar contract/orders
completed within the past 3 years (or contracts and orders which were
currently being completed). The amounts and locations awarded were
based on the offers received and the evaluation of those offers.
Regarding oversight, there are safeguards in place to protect
taxpayers' funds and ensure that relevant laws and regulations are
followed. USDA provides oversight throughout the contract period,
conducting robust audits to ensure food safety plans are followed, that
only domestic produce is provided, and that quality products are
delivered, among other contract administration matters. Contracts
require suppliers to source food from producers, prepare the boxes of
items identified in their proposal, and deliver the boxes to nonprofit
organizations on a mutually agreeable, recurring schedule, while
adhering to the high USDA food safety protocols. Payment is only made
upon the submission of an invoice documenting evidence of delivery and
adherence to the contractual requirements.
In addition, the Contracting Officer is responsible for monitoring
the performance of all contractors. If there are concerns, contractual
remedies may be used, which could include termination. USDA has chosen
to exercise this right in two situations. As with any new program,
evaluations are ongoing to assist USDA in determining whether any
adjustments are needed.
Next Steps
The program was designed to put American farmers and distributors
of all sizes back to work while supporting over-burdened food banks;
community and faith-based organizations; and other nonprofits serving
Americans in need. USDA continues to prioritize working with impacted
businesses of all sizes and across all regions of the United States, to
ensure maximum positive impact of the program during the COVID-19
pandemic.
USDA also understands that challenges and lessons learned have been
identified throughout the current program.
Some of these challenges and lessons learned include:

Last mile distribution and the costs associated with that
distribution;

Nonprofit access to all types of food boxes; and

Variation in box size and contents.

While I cannot provide specific details on how each of these
challenges will be addressed because this is a Federal contract
activity, later this week, USDA will announce an opportunity for new
and current vendors to submit proposals to utilize approximately $500-
$700 million that will be remaining when current contracts expire on
August 31.
Conclusion
In the early days of the pandemic in March and April, USDA
recognized the impacts to farmers, families, and sectors of the
agricultural supply chain and responded by establishing this new
program in a relatively short period of time. Tens of millions of boxes
have been delivered resulting in hundreds of millions of meals being
provided for needy Americans. As Secretary Perdue has stated on
multiple occasions, the program is a ``win-win-win.'' While the
feedback received by the Department has been overwhelmingly positive,
we are constantly evaluating program operations and inviting input in
order to ensure the program continues to have as positive an impact as
possible. Again, thank you for the opportunity to be here today and I
am happy to answer any questions you may have.

Mr. Peterson [presiding.] I thank the Under Secretary for
his testimony, the Chair went up to vote, and so I will just
take care of this until she gets back.
So the question I have regards--one of the questions
regards what I talked about earlier, and that is the self-
certification issue. Is there nobody from the IG, or from the
GAO, or anybody to check any of that stuff? It is all just
hearing or taking peoples' word for it?
Mr. Ibach. The Farmers to Families Food Box Program was
authorized by Congress under the Families First Coronavirus
Response Act, which I believe was the second Act that was
passed to address the coronavirus.
Mr. Peterson. CARES Act, yes.
Mr. Ibach. Under that, Congress authorized USDA to access
such funds as necessary to address the newly unemployed. It
does not necessarily fall under the same rules and regulations
that FNS's programs does.
And so it was designed not to need to be means-tested, and
so there is a difference there between the Farmers to Families
Box Program and the other----
Mr. Peterson. If we weren't in this situation, there might
be some kind of auditing going on if we were in a normal kind
of situation?
Mr. Ibach. At the time that the program was designed, we
were hearing from food banks that they were under such need
that they didn't have time to go through income verification,
or means-testing, and so it was intentionally designed----
Mr. Peterson. Yes.
Our discussion we had earlier here about the--how you
acquire the dairy, and produce, and so forth, this is all done
on competitive bids?
Mr. Ibach. Again, the Section 32 purchases, and all the
purchases we make under the other FNS feeding programs are done
under competitive bid. The Farmers to Families Food Box
Program, because we needed to address getting food out faster,
competitive bid wasn't part of the consideration. It was some
of the other factors are they able to prove that they have
experience doing this? Are they financially able to do this?
Price competitive was not our number one consideration.
Mr. Peterson. But you must be doing some oversight over
that? You are not just letting it be wide open?
Mr. Ibach. We are doing oversight. We do know the average
price of each category of boxes. We can compare that to the
marketplace. But there is a difference, and we wanted also to
be able to free our contractors to be able to purchase from
farmers in the region where they were going to be distributing
the boxes to make sure the fresh fruits and produce in that
region that were being wasted were able to be incorporated into
the Food Box Program.
Mr. Peterson. Under normal circumstances, though, there
would be some kind of auditing of that process, the competitive
bidding and so forth?
Mr. Ibach. Yes. And as we move forward with the second
phase that I suggested in the testimony that we would be
announcing later this week, a new competitive process, we are
going to elevate the value consideration in our evaluation of
those proposals that are forwarded to USDA.
Mr. Peterson. The gentleman from South Dakota?
Mr. Johnson. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, I
appreciate it. Thanks, Mr. Ibach. I want to start by just
highlighting some of the positive feedback that I have heard in
South Dakota about this program. Of course, no program is
perfect, but Ms. Katherine Anderson of Aberdeen sent the
following note of thanks, and I will make sure that this gets
entered into the record of the hearing. ``To Farmers to
Families, I am thanking you for the generous boxes I received
in Aberdeen, South Dakota. I shared with a divorced friend who
cares for an adult disabled son. We were both flabbergasted at
the contents of the boxes. It was Christmas in July. Please
forward my thank you to any producers, organizers, secretaries,
et cetera that you can. You made a whopping difference to this
person.'' Logistically, when I consider everything that the
Department has done, that the distributors have done, and that
the food banks who ultimately help to finish that last mile
have done, It is remarkable. It is remarkable how much food has
been sent out there, so thank you for the efforts of the
Department.
There has been some data I have reviewed that has shown the
disparities, state by state, of how many dollars have actually
hit per million people. I think that is been put together by
your agency. What drives those differences in numbers?
Mr. Ibach. Excuse me. One of the pillars of the program is
that contractors had to offer to participate in the program,
and so there were certain regions of the country where less
people offered to become our contractors, which created--which
we were able to analyze and identify as under-served areas in
certain places of the United States. We have gone to direct
contracting, and we have invested $218 million in direct
contracting to try to address those under-served areas.
Mr. Johnson. I know there was a phase two. A relatively
small number of new contracts were issued as part of phase two.
Did you have any attempts to try to balance some of those
regional disparities?
Mr. Ibach. That direct contracting, the $218 million, was
used as part of phase two to go directly to those under-served
areas. Under phase two we have also extended a vast majority of
the original contracts because of the success those contractors
enjoyed in supplying food boxes to families.
Mr. Johnson. I know it was in your written testimony, which
I reviewed, you may have said it when I ran out to the floor to
vote, but I just want to highlight, because we have had some
legitimate questions about accountability. In your written
testimony, at the very least, you noted that a couple of
contracts have been terminated, and I suspect there are tools
in USDA's toolbox outside of termination that you are also able
to use to try to make sure that people are holding up their end
of the bargain, is that right?
Mr. Ibach. There were 198 contracts awarded out of the
nearly 600 contracts offered to USDA. We had one contractor
that, after being selected, decided they did not want to
participate, so that contract was terminated. We had another
contractor whose circumstances represented in their offer did
not hold up after they were awarded the contract, so that
contract was terminated. We have had numerous oversight
activities on other contracts that were identified as high-risk
contracts, or gained media attention to assure that those
contracts were being responsibly administered.
Mr. Johnson. To shift a half a step in a different
direction, sir, I mean, you have been overseeing an
investigation for almost a year now on inefficiencies, or
disruptions, or concerns in the cattle market. Do you have
anything--any updates for us today?
Mr. Ibach. I think that we are nearing conclusion of that
process, and we look forward to being able to release a report
from USDA in the very near future.
Mr. Johnson. Well, maybe after that is released it will
make sense for some subcommittee, the Agriculture Committee, to
have another hearing, but as long as I have you in the hot
seat, I mean, does packers and stockyards--do you all have the
resources that would be needed to follow up from anything that
would come from that report?
Mr. Ibach. I think that there are going to be several
things that come out of that report that Members of the
Committee, as well as the industry, will want to consider and
discuss, and there may be actions that the Committee and the
industry may want to consider as a result of that report.
Mr. Johnson. Okay. Well, with the little time I have left,
I am sure it is a bill you are aware of, but some of us, in a
bipartisan way, have introduced H.R. 7425, DIRECT Act (Direct
Interstate Retail Exemption for Certain Transactions Act). I
think this is an opportunity to try to make sure that state
inspected facilities have an opportunity to sell across state
lines direct to consumer. This is, of course, not as flexible
as some people want it, but it is laser focused. It is tailored
to make sure we don't run afoul of food safety concerns, or of
trade concerns with other countries. Any observations that you
would have on the DIRECT Act? I mean, we want to try to add
more capacity to the interstate system. Did we calibrate our
approach right, in your opinion?
Mr. Ibach. That authority would be within Under Secretary
for Food Safety, or the Office for Food Safety.
Mr. Johnson. Dr. Brashears.
Mr. Ibach. Dr. Brashears, and so it would be more
appropriate for her to interact with you on answers to those
specific questions.
Mr. Johnson. Well, and it won't surprise you at all to know
that I have lots of conversations with her, but given your
experience in the marketplace, I wanted to try to put you on
the spot anyway.
Mr. Ibach. Okay.
Mr. Johnson. Thank you very much, ma'am. I yield back.
The Chair [presiding.] Thank you very much. I will
recognize myself for 5 minutes.
Mr. Ibach, you, in your statement, indicated that you
awarded up to $1.2 billion in the first round of contracts. How
much money has the Department actually paid out for invoices in
that first round?
Mr. Ibach. I will maybe refer to Administrator Summers to
give some of those specifics, but first of all I would like to
just hit a couple statistics there: 77 percent of the
contractors that we entered into agreements with delivered 90
percent or more of the volume they----
The Chair. Sir, I only have 5 minutes, I just want to know
how much has been paid.
Mr. Summers. At this point--sorry. Good afternoon. At this
point we have delivered 35 million boxes at the value of about
$900 million.
The Chair. Is that what you have paid out? The $900 million
that is my question.
Mr. Summers. Yes, ma'am.
The Chair. Okay. Second, how is the Department verifying
these invoices for accuracy?
Mr. Ibach. Go ahead.
Mr. Summers. The invoices are accompanied with delivery
documents showing how many boxes were delivered to which
nonprofit organizations. The invoice comes in with an amount,
but then has to be backed up by delivery receipts that are
signed by the recipient organization.
The Chair. Do you have direct contact with the nonprofit
organization that is receiving them?
Mr. Summers. Generally not, unless we have a question.
The Chair. How many invoices have been rejected?
Mr. Summers. None have been rejected outright. They will be
paid once the appropriate documentation is supplied. At one
point there were about 400 that we were working on. That number
has come down significantly since then. But, again, if an
invoice comes in, doesn't have the appropriate documentation.
The Chair. So, every invoice that has been submitted to
you, you have paid?
Mr. Summers. Basically, yes.
Mr. Ibach. I think it has been possible----
Mr. Summers. There may be a few that are pending payment
right now, but not very many, because round one is basically
over.
The Chair. Okay. Does USDA have a publicly available list
of participating nonprofits and/or food banks by the region and
supplier?
Mr. Summers. We have that for the contractors, the
distributors that we are contracting with. We don't have a
publicly available list of all of the nonprofits that are
working with the distributors that we contracted with.
The Chair. We would like to see that.
Mr. Summers. The list of the contractors?
The Chair. Yes.
Mr. Summers. Yes, absolutely. That is on our website.
The Chair. Okay.
Mr. Summers. And we could provide----
The Chair. It is publicly available?
Mr. Summers. Yes, ma'am.
The Chair. Okay.
Mr. Summers. It has been updated now, it is now updated to
reflect the new contracts under round two as well.
The Chair. Okay. What were the eligibility requirements for
individuals to receive Farmers to Families food boxes?
Mr. Ibach. I will let you keep going.
Mr. Summers. We put out a request for proposals, based on a
series of criteria, and, as the Under Secretary said, we
received 600 proposals in response. We evaluated those criteria
on a number of factors, including the ability to partner with
nonprofit organizations to deliver food to Americans in need.
It also looked at past business experience, financial ability
to meet the needs of the program, as well as price. It was a
series of criteria that we used.
The Chair. So, how do we end up with a wedding planner?
Mr. Summers. Every firm, including that one, provided
information in their proposal that showed that they had been
involved in the distribution of food, and then had the ability
to go out, procure food, pack it in boxes, and deliver it to
nonprofit organizations.
The Chair. But that proved not to be accurate, didn't it?
Mr. Summers. No, ma'am. They supplied about 500,000 boxes.
They did not supply the entire amount of their contract. I
think it was 60, almost 70 percent.
The Chair. And just to your answer right before this, it is
my understanding that on your website you have a list of the
suppliers, but not the nonprofits you supplied to?----
Mr. Summers. Yes, right.
We don't have the nonprofits. We have the list of the folks
we have----
The Chair. I would like to see the nonprofits that were
supplied.
Mr. Summers. Okay. We will have to compile that. It is
many, many thousands.
The Chair. Okay. I yield back. Thank you. I would now
recognize Mr. Conaway for 5 minutes.
Mr. Conaway. Thank you, Madam Chairman. I have a letter
here from Borden Company, which is located in Dallas, and
services an awful lot of Texas. I would like to read a couple
of comments. ``When COVID-19 began making its impact in the
U.S., Borden lost approximately 30% of its business virtually
overnight due to school and restaurant closures. The contract
Borden was awarded through the Farmers to Families Food Box
Program enabled us to preserve employment and benefits for our
people. The opportunity has reinvigorated our employees to
fulfill this important mission of providing nutrition for
American families.'' It also states, ``More importantly, Borden
has supplied or scheduled donations for nearly 1,000 charitable
organizations across the country. By August 31, we anticipate
we will have provided more than 11 million free gallons of milk
to people in need.'' Borden, by the way, is in bankruptcy
reorganization, but at the same time they are fulfilling this
wonderful work. I ask unanimous consent, Madam Chair, to submit
into the record the letter, the various social media praises,
photos from recipient organizations.
[The letter referred to is located on p. 76.]
Mr. Conaway. Thank you, ma'am.
Secretary Ibach, you said that there was a survey done of
the contractors on the 22nd and 26th of June. Has the
Department given any thought to surveying recipients, recipient
entities, those that the Chair has asked to give you a list of?
Have you got a survey of those folks to see what insights you
might get from them?
Mr. Ibach. As we have had the program develop, have been
open to input from the recipient organizations, the food banks,
as well as the nonprofits and faith-based organizations, and we
have worked with them to help them understand what our
contractors are required to do under their contracts, and in
some cases that has helped smooth some of the misunderstandings
about the delivery, and the coordination between the
contractors and those recipients.
Mr. Conaway. All right. Do you think a survey of the folks
would be helpful?
Mr. Ibach. Yes, we can continue to do that and that would
be helpful.
Mr. Conaway. Okay.
Madam Chair, the clock is now running, but I will ask one
more real quick question. Mr. Ibach, the vaccine bank recently
announced some activity there. Would you give us a quick
summary? I know that is off topic, but would you give a quick
response, since I have you.
Mr. Ibach. Yes. We announced that we invested about $27.1
million of the sums that you had made available in the 2018
Farm Bill. With that, we purchased 47 million doses of foot-
and-mouth vaccine. During the negotiation process, we were able
to extend the effective date on the vaccine from 5 years to 10
years, so we feel that we almost got a twofer in our purchase
there.
Mr. Conaway. That was code for the shelf life of the
vaccine? When expired, will they sit on our shelves? You will
rotate that stock through so that you maintain standard life
already, but then at the end of 10 years you will have some
program in place to use what was there?
Mr. Ibach. Yes. We have worked with them, and have
something that we feel very good about.
Mr. Conaway. All right. Thank you. Madam Chair, I yield
back.
The Chair. Thank you very much. Mr. McGovern, you are
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. McGovern. Thank you, Madam Chair, I appreciate it. Let
me just state at the outset that even before this COVID-19
public health crisis we had a hunger problem in the United
States of America. And since the onset of the crisis, that
hunger problem has gotten a whole hell of a lot worse. In
Massachusetts, where I represent, before the COVID-19 public
health crisis, more than 600,000 people experienced food
insecurity. Recent projections from Feeding America estimate
somewhere in the excess of 940,000 people. But despite the
Northeast region representing one of the highest numbers of
COVID-19 cases in the country, and ten percent of the country's
population, we received the second-lowest allocation of any
geographic region, only $46 million, or 4.4 percent, of the
total $1.2 billion made in the first round of USDA's
distributions, and only $57.5 million, less than four percent
of the total $1.5 billion awarded by USDA in the second round
of distribution.
Mr. Summers, on July 2 the Food Bank of Western
Massachusetts, which I represent, wrote you a letter listing
some of the challenges that they have experienced with the
Farmers to Families Program. Are you familiar with the letter
at all?
Mr. Ibach. Yes, we are familiar with, this is Under
Secretary Ibach, and I will take this question, if you will
indulge me, we are familiar with some of the communication that
we have received. We also are familiar with the fact that we
did not have as many offers from the Northeast region of the
United States as we had hoped that we would, and so that is
partially why we were unable to award larger sums to the
northeastern portion of the United States. We did invest $218
million to try to address areas that we felt were under-served
through direct contracting, where we reached out to suppliers
to try to enhance the Farmers to Families Food Box Program in
the Northeast. This isn't the only program that we run.
Mr. McGovern. I have 5 minutes, then I get cut off. With
respect, I think the view in my state, in New England, that we
were not sufficiently provided with the food that, quite
frankly, we needed. And so maybe my question should be, how
does AMS process feedback from food banks and contractors on
how the Farmers to Families Program is going? I mean, what has
AMS done to facilitate communication between contractors and
food banks to make sure that the program is working as
intended? Because the goal here should be to make sure no one
goes hungry.
Now, before the pandemic a criticism of the Administration
was that they were indifferent to the plight of people who are
hungry in this country. I still feel that way, and here is a
program that is supposed to provide some relief, and yet it
didn't live up to its expectation. I will associate myself with
the remarks of Mr. Peterson by saying we ought to be expanding
SNAP at this particular point. Unfortunately, that has become a
political football, with this Administration, but if you could
answer my question, how do you process this, and how do you
communicate with food banks, and how do you know whether or not
areas are being shortchanged?
Mr. Ibach. We are going to have a new announcement of
availability of proposals that we are going to announce later
this week that will make available an additional $500 to $700
million. We plan to host a webinar to help contractors that
would be making proposals understand the rules, and we hope by
doing that we will encourage more participation in the
Northeast part of the United States. We also hope to make food
available to the northeastern portion of the United States
through our trade mitigation purchases that are made available
for food banks to order the food that they need, and that they
anticipate they need, and we also are working as partners with
FNS as they invest the $850 million of additional funding to
purchase food that Congress allocated FNS through the
coronavirus relief programs that, again, are distributed based
on the orders that we receive from the states and the food bank
system.
Mr. McGovern. And you received the letter from the food
bank, and I am sure from others in the Northeast. Do you follow
up? Have you talked to these people? Have you tried to work
with them to see where some of the challenges are? I mean, the
bottom line is there is hunger in this country, food
insecurity, is exploding. This is a humanitarian crisis, and
again, any little crumbs that we can get from the
Administration to try to address this, we want to make sure
that we are utilizing it.
And, I appreciate--do a webinar at some point, but have you
been in touch with the Food Bank of Western Massachusetts, or
have you contacted any of the food banks in the Northeast?
Given the fact that I think we could all acknowledge what was
necessary to get there, in order to make a dent into this
problem, didn't get there. I mean, is there direct
communication like that, or is it just tune into a webinar on a
date-certain?
Mr. Ibach. Definitely USDA has multiple mission areas that
are working on hunger. FNS would work more directly with those
food banks to assess their needs to help them understand the
food that is available to request and purchase, as well as AMS
would then purchase the food that is being offered and being--
offered to and ordered by those food banks. Yes, we are working
directly with food banks, as well as state feeding programs to
understand what their needs are.
The Chair. Thank you. Mr. Bacon, you are recognized for 5
minutes.
Mr. Bacon. Thank you, Madam Chair. I want to just also note
here that Mr. Ibach is from Nebraska, one of our favorite sons,
so thank you for being here today. You may have mentioned this,
but I had to go vote twice, so I apologize if you are repeating
this. Can you just explain a little bit how the farmers are
compensated? How do you determine the compensation for each
box? How does that work?
Mr. Ibach. Most of the food boxes are put together by
distributors or contractors that had experience in distributing
food. Obviously, that in most cases was not a farmer himself,
but it has been encouraged, and was part of the solicitation
that they try to source the food products locally or
regionally, and so those distributors that are putting together
the food boxes would reach out to the farmers themselves to
purchase the items to put it in the box.
Mr. Bacon. It tends to be a standard rate for whatever the
food is?
Mr. Ibach. Yes. They would probably go to the marketplace
and look at what the price was, and what the farmer was asking
for that.
Mr. Bacon. Is there a particular favorite with the
recipients? Is there, like, the fastest moving kind of produce,
or what is the best ticket item?
Mr. Ibach. I have been to Montana, I have been to
Philadelphia, I have been to New Jersey, and I have been to
Ohio and looked at food boxes. The Secretary has been even more
places and looked at food boxes. There is huge variety. I
looked at one in Cleveland yesterday that was being put
together that had 15 different items in it. Those items vary
each week that they put the box together, and so there is great
variety between fruits and vegetables in most of these boxes.
And then, as we move into the dairy products, I also saw a box
that had fluid milk, cottage cheese, several different flavors
of block cheese, as well as yogurt, a lot of variety.
Mr. Bacon. One last question. Have you heard concerns,
like, the local grocers, does this impact their business?
Because, you have the access to the SNAP Program, so is there a
little bit of give and take here, or what kind of feedback are
you getting?
Mr. Ibach. Actually, there has been some concern,
especially in the dairy sector, as the dairy sector struggled
at the time that we had milk being wasted, and so the way the
program was designed, and the prices that were reflected for
cheese and milk at that time were very low. As the distribution
system has adjusted, and demand has remained strong at retail,
the price of cheese has steadily increased, and so the Box
Program actually provides an opportunity for contractors to
come to USDA and say, ``Hey, the retail market is demanding
this product, can we adjust our box,'' and we have a process to
go through to allow that to happen.
Mr. Bacon. Thank you very much. Thanks for coming in. Good
to see one of our favorite sons here. Madam Chair, I yield
back.
The Chair. Thank you very much. The chair now recognizes
Ms. Adams, for 5 minutes.
Ms. Adams. Thank you, Madam Chair. Can you hear me?
The Chair. Yes.
Ms. Adams. Okay.
The Chair. Yes, we can hear you.
Ms. Adams. Well, okay. Thank you. Thank you, Chair Fudge,
and Ranking Member Johnson, for holding the hearing, and, Under
Secretary, thank you for being here.
First let me thank you for the work on this program. Food
banks in my district have received over 1 million pounds of
food so far. We have a lot of struggling families there, but it
is urgent that we help Americans facing food insecurity, and
farmers who are hurting because of this pandemic, and that is
what the program aims to do. I do have a few questions to
ensure that USDA is working to incorporate feedback from folks
on the ground.
Now, according to USDA's website, 44 contracts have been
issued for the Southeast region so far, totaling about $364
million, and North Carolina vendors only received five of those
contracts, totaling about $8 million, which is about two
percent of the funding for our region. At the same time, nine
contracts totaling $155 million were given to vendors
headquartered in states well outside of our region, like
Washington, Pennsylvania, and Colorado. My first question is,
did the USDA contracting process include any consideration for
sourcing from nearby vendors, keeping foods within or close to
their home state or region?
Mr. Ibach. Yes, the contracting process did emphasize, or
encourage contractors to source food locally, as well as from
small and medium-sized producers, or farmers, if you will, and
so there was a provision for that. Thank you.
Ms. Adams. Okay. Well, nonprofits and food banks
participating in the program in my state, they have told me
that they are having to pay for the storage and the delivery of
perishable foods that they receive. Unlike TEFAP, this program,
is providing food without covering any administrative costs,
and so that leaves a lot of food banks high and dry, especially
those servicing smaller areas with less existing capacity to
store large quantities of food. To what extent is USDA able to
assist nonprofits and food banks with these challenges, such as
the ability to store perishable foods, and procure
transportation to pick up the food boxes?
Mr. Ibach. Under this program, the food banks and the
nonprofits actually are in the driver's seat, and have the
power to refuse delivery, and it is incumbent upon the
contractor to work with the food bank to be able to take
deliveries when they are able to either distribute the food
directly, or when they have the storage ability.
Ms. Adams. Okay. Does USDA have a mechanism in place for
nonprofit food banks to provide complaints or feedback about
the suppliers that they are working with?
Mr. Ibach. We have many different points of entry for
people to be able to supply USDA with feedback about the
program, and we actually welcome the feedback that we would
receive, because we want to continue to improve the program,
and in some cases the feedback has allowed us to reach out to
the contractor to remind them of their responsibility under the
contract to work more directly and in a more accommodating
fashion with the recipient of the boxes.
Ms. Adams. All right. Well, thank you very much. Thank you,
Madam Chair. I yield back.
The Chair. Thank you very much. Mr. Hagedorn, you are now
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. Hagedorn. Thank you, Madam Chair, I appreciate that. It
is great to see the witnesses, Mr. Secretary. Since you are
here, I want to reiterate what you know, that our farmers,
particularly in southern Minnesota, I can attest to them going
through tough times since they closed down the restaurants, and
the futures markets went through the tank, and the packing
plants were disrupted, so I appreciate what you, and the
Department, and Secretary, everybody is doing to help them, but
we need to do more, and we are all committed to that, so keep
working with you on that.
We have a regional food bank, Channel One, in our district
that is distributed about $370,000 worth of food to people.
This program is working for folks, and I can also testify on
some of the senior nutrition programs that they are working--I
was just in Austin less than a couple weeks ago helping to
distribute meals at lunch, and they are getting out 500 or more
meals just in Austin, Minnesota every day, so it is making a
big difference, and we appreciate it.
One of the folks that has been involved in this is
Northview Church, which distributes meals into Minnesota, in
Chairman Peterson's district, but they write--one result of
these events has been the founding of Reach of the Heart, a
service-minded entity through which we recently distributed
75,000 pounds of food to those of need of our community, all
because of the food provided by Farmers to Families. These
events, conducted in June, went a long way toward promoting
community unity at a time when civil unrest was stirring in our
area. I was pleased that we were able to distribute food to
diverse groups, including those who came to the United States
from Nepal, Haiti, Sudan, Ivory Coast, and Bosnia, just to name
a few.
There are some great stories out there of what is being
done. I would like, Madam Chair, to submit this letter for the
record, if that is okay? I ask unanimous consent to do that.
[The letter referred to is located on p. 106.] *
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Editor's note: the letter referred to is part of the Attachment
to the letter submitted by Mr. Conaway.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Chair. Without objection.
Mr. Hagedorn. And there is one specific case, Mr.
Secretary, that has come before me that I would like an
explanation, and it has to do with a vendor in San Antonio. Can
you walk me through that a little bit, and tell me how that one
was handled? And maybe some of the facts that are out there
aren't exactly accurate.
Mr. Ibach. I would assume that you are referencing the
contractor that the Chair has referenced several times as well,
and so, with that assumption, I won't necessarily say the name,
but, yes, we became aware of the concern that surfaced among
Congress, among the media about that contractor. We spent time
with that contractor to make sure that we re-verified that they
were capable of trying to fulfill their contract. We visited
their facilities, and talked to the management of that group,
and, as a result of that, they had the opportunity to deliver
up to 750,000 boxes. They did deliver 500,000 boxes. They were
only paid for the amount of boxes that they actually delivered,
and so the fact that they maybe came up a little bit short on
their numbers, they were not awarded--rewarded financially for
not delivering those boxes.
Mr. Hagedorn. I appreciate the clarification on that. And
this is like a lot of different programs that have been
authorized and appropriated here recently. Obviously we had a
crisis situation, we put things together, rules are written
very quickly. We are trying to get, whether it is money or
food, out the door and help the American people, and it is good
to know that you are going to provide the type of oversight
that we need on this to make this right as we move forward.
Thank you, I appreciate your testimony, and I yield back.
The Chair. Thank you. The chair now recognizes Ms. Schrier.
You are recognized for 5 minutes.
Ms. Schrier. Thank you. And, Under Secretary Ibach, thank
you so much for having a conversation with me back in April
about specialty crops. I very much appreciated that, and I
appreciate your being here today with us. I also want to say
that, in my state, farmers and food banks very much appreciate
this program. That said, it is very hard to do a program this
big from 30,000 feet, and that is really where my questions are
going today.
I recently spoke to a medium-sized co-op who has a contract
in my state, and he indicated that the USDA is by far his
largest customer, and that the Farmers to Families Food Box
Program is keeping the bills paid for dozens of their grower
members, and that is fantastic. The issue he wanted to raise
was the issue of pricing. The price of a box depends on what is
in it, and the transportation, and the storage, which
incentivizes, essentially, if you have a distributor in
Seattle, they can price much more competitively if they only
deliver within 50 miles of Seattle, which really leaves our
rural communities disadvantaged once again. And so I was
wondering, in order to serve our rural communities, and still
take into account pricing for these distributors, whether the
USDA will give any consideration to changing that policy, or at
least to look at distance traveled in evaluating that.
Mr. Ibach. Definitely, for phase one, pricing wasn't our
number one consideration because we realized that there were
going to be, in rural areas especially, more costs associated
with that distribution. Storage and distribution is something
that the contractor is able to build into their box price, and
when I was in Cleveland yesterday, one of the participants,
Wiers Farms, actually gave $1 per box to the food bank itself,
or their co-operator that was to aid in the distribution, and
that was an eligible expense to be bid into the process.
Definitely delivery and storage, and that is why we didn't want
to necessarily have them compete against each other just based
on price, because that would have made it more difficult for
those rural areas to be served, and so we want to continue to
try to make sure we are getting value, but not eliminate
people, because the overhead costs do vary.
Ms. Schrier. But here is another quick question about
overhead is that a lot of the small to medium farmers don't
have the GAP (Good Agricultural Practices) certification, and
they would love to participate. I mean, if the idea is to keep
food local, and support our small farmers, would you give
consideration to not having to have that GAP certification?
Mr. Ibach. One of our major concerns was maintaining food
safety throughout this process. The worst thing that could
happen is that we have a food safety slip through this, and
make people ill as a result of our distribution program, so we
tried to enforce the same food safety standards that we had in
place for our other feeding programs to keep that consistency,
and also make sure we kept that standard available. I think we
would want to continue to elevate food safety as we move
through this.
Ms. Schrier. That makes sense. If I could ask one more
thing, that is one of the reasons, actually, that I introduced
a bill called H.R. 6725, the Farmers Feeding Families
Coronavirus Response Act, which really gets the state in there,
so you could have the non-GAP (Good Agricultural Practices)
certified farmers, the small, medium, farmers' market type
farmers involved, and you could bring this down to the state
level, where they really are used to dealing with small
farmers, small food banks. If the program is really about
helping food stay local, working with local and small growers
and regional distributors, can we give more of this
responsibility and ownership to the states? Because I know
Washington State's Department of Agriculture could be a very
nimble aid in distributing these boxes.
Mr. Ibach. And I worked at the beginning of the program
with Director Sandison, and we had some conversations about how
he might be able to reach out to some of the people that were
awarded contracts to be able to help them understand who in
their vicinity might be able to supply him, to try to connect
those small and medium sized farmers, or the farmers' market
vendors to those programs, and continue to want to do that.
There are various programs that USDA has that we are trying to
implement and use to cover the whole need that is out there,
because the need for food is great.
Ms. Schrier. Thank you. I would love to help our small
farmers. Thank you very much. Yield back.
Mrs. Hayes [presiding.] Okay. I now recognize Mr. Davis for
5 minutes. Thank you. I guess I recognize myself for 5 minutes.
Thank you, Mr. Ibach, for being here today. I come from the
State of Connecticut, and we have been one of the states that
was hit hard by COVID-19 in the very early stages. We have seen
over 400,000 cases of the virus, and over 4,000 deaths in my
state. In addition to threatening the health of our residents,
COVID-19 has decimated our economy, and further destabilized
Americans' steady access to nutritious meals.
Early in the pandemic I heard from farmers in my district
that they were having to dump milk and discard other products
due to business interruption with restaurants and school
districts. At the same time, I was hearing from food banks that
lines were stretching around buildings, while donations were
dwindling. The Farmers to Families Food Box Program was billed
as a solution to this pressing issue, a way for farmers
experiencing those difficulties to partner with food banks, and
ensure families were fed. In my district, it is home to many
small farmers, rather than the large industrial farm operations
that we often hear about. Although our farms have great
relationships with local food banks, they were completely left
out of this program for a variety of foreseeable reasons.
First, not only did the Department's application process have a
very short turnaround time for interested contractors, but they
conducted a regional open competition process in order to
select those contractors once they applied. Mr. Ibach, why did
the Department decide to have a completely open regional
competition process, rather than one with set-asides for small
farmers, minority farmers, or new and beginning farmers who
were disproportionately suffering due to the economic crisis of
COVID-19?
Mr. Ibach. Implementing the program in a speedy fashion was
one of our major considerations because of the crisis that we
were hearing from the fruit and vegetable industry about the
waste of food occurring there, as well as the waste of milk and
dairy products that was occurring. And so, while we conducted
webinars, the opportunities to try to inform people about the
parameters of becoming involved with the program, it did
proceed very quickly, and we know that there were people that
weren't able to react fast enough to be able to embrace the
program. And we are going to open again another bid process at
the end of this week, and we are going to--we are committed to
trying to provide informational sessions to be able to help
more people be able to bid competitively.
Mrs. Hayes. Okay, good. Is there any opportunity for either
set-asides or consideration for small farmers, especially in
the Northeast regions like I am talking about? Because an open
competition process is just disproportionate, when you think
about it, as a regional effort.
Mr. Ibach. Within the bidding, and selection, and
evaluation process there was priority given to those
contractors that talked about sourcing local and embracing the
agriculture that was near their vicinity. While that wasn't a
set-aside, we believe it somewhat influenced that ability for
those smaller farmers. But, no, we weren't able to provide a
set-aside during that first bid process.
Mrs. Hayes. Considering that only about four percent of
small farms received access to the program, have you considered
doing anything differently with your application process, or
even the way, initially you said the turnout was low, but now
that you have seen the problems, I understand we tried to
implement a lot of things very quickly, but now that we have
identified the problems, in the next rollout, have you
specifically addressed any of the challenges that are faced by
farmers in my community, or small farmers across the United
States?
Mr. Ibach. We have tried to adjust the program and the
contracting process to be able to meet some of the problems
that we identified. We still will not be able to go so far as
to be able to implement a set-aside in the time that we have
available to get food to people.
Mrs. Hayes. And I guess just the last thing, I would say we
have heard a lot of conversation about it today, but I
recognize the efforts of the Department to solve a problem that
was happening in real time, but you have to understand the
concern that we are experiencing when we see that a wedding
planner received funds, or access to the program when local
farmers, with established relationships to food banks, were
left out of consideration. I just hope that in the next phase,
or even moving forward, that, now that we have seen it, and we
have experienced it, that we can work hard to mitigate the
problem and ensure it doesn't happen again.
Mr. Ibach. Yes, and we appreciate that, and we will do
that, but also part of the program was to be able to make
access available to the most amount of people to enter into the
program because we knew that the need was great for people to
participate to be able to distribute as much food as possible.
Mrs. Hayes. Thank you. I yield back. I now recognize Mr.
Davis.
Mr. Davis. Thank you, Madam Chair, and I appreciate the
opportunity to be here. Sorry I wasn't ready right off the bat,
but here I am. Let me pull my notes out, and I want to tell
you, though, Mr. Secretary, it has been great to talk to you
via conference call during this pandemic, talk about what the
Farmers to Families Food Box Program has done. I was very proud
to see, when the first boxes arrived at the Taylorville Food
Pantry in my hometown of Taylorville, that we immediately put
it out on social media. And I can tell you personally, and you
have heard me say this to you via phone call, that the line at
the Taylorville Food Pantry in my hometown of 11,000 people has
grown exponentially throughout this pandemic. I can't go into
town from where I live without driving by and seeing that line
on the days that they are distributing, so we appreciate the
investment, and we appreciate the opportunity to talk about it
here.
Also in my district, Vermilion Valley, a central Illinois
produce company, was awarded a contract that has since been
extended. It has provided approximately 350,000 boxes to tens
of thousands of families filled with locally grown produce and
dairy from nearby producers like Ropp Jersey Cheese in
Bloomington, Illinois, and also Prairie Farms in my district.
John Rollins, their President and CEO, wrote a letter to the
Chair and the Ranking Member of this Committee, outlining the
many successes of the program, and I would like to ask
unanimous consent to submit this letter in its entirety for the
record.
Mrs. Hayes. So ordered.
[The letter referred to is located on p. 75.]
Mr. Davis. Thank you. These contracts have allowed
Vermilion Valley to hire back workers who were laid off due to
the lack of business, and to state-mandated closures. It also
allowed many of our local nonprofits to continue their outreach
in our local communities too. Separately I recently introduced
a bill called the, H.R. 6968, Meals on Wheels For Kids Act of
2020, which, like Farmers to Families, would innovate the way
we carry out existing programs by creating more partnerships
between existing community organizations to deliver healthy
meals to kids during the summer months, especially in rural
areas, who live miles away from the congregate sites that you
have helped to establish. With that in mind, I think these are
some innovative solutions that we need.
And, Under Secretary Ibach, a quick question, what are your
plans to continue the program? And I know everybody has
probably asked what type of funding measures that we can put
forth, but how does this program, going into the future, past
this pandemic, how does it coincide with our congregate
programs, and how can we provide the long-term sustainable
funding to continue to get box foods like this, and really
integrate it with our senior Meals on Wheels Programs so that
we have the volunteers, and we have the outreach already
getting into some of our most under-served, inaccessible areas?
There is no more time that we have seen the importance of
feeding hungry kids. Let us make sure we develop the plans to
do it after the pandemic too.
Mr. Ibach. The funding to pay for the Farmers to Families
Food Box Program came as a result of the Families First
Coronavirus Response Act that was the second coronavirus relief
program that Congress passed. In that, Congress provided USDA
funds as necessary to implement programs to feed Americans that
were in need. We feel, and Congress, you would feel the same
way, that that money expires with the fiscal year, and so the
$3 billion that we have invested, or committed, or asked for so
far, $1.3 million of which, about $900,000 was actually
requested in payment. We had about the same amount of money
that is in the second phase that has been authorized, and we
plan on trying to take bids to fulfill or invest the rest of
the money that would have food boxes going out through the
month of October. After that, we wouldn't have funding
available without authorization from Congress.
Mr. Davis. As--okay. Well, I understand that. On an annual
basis you are going to get an appropriations, but how can we
work together to make the feeding programs in the post-pandemic
work even better, especially in the rural areas, where we know
so many kids are still left behind because they don't have that
congregate opportunity? Let us continue to work together to
come up with some solutions, because it is not about just
feeding kids who can come to the congregate centers, which do a
great job in my larger communities, but I know there are a lot
of communities that don't have gas stations, they don't have
grocery stores, they don't have food in their fridge when those
kids are home for the summer. So let us work together and
integrate some existing programs. And with that, Madam Chair, I
yield back.
The Chair [presiding.] Thank you. The chair now recognizes
Mr. Panetta, for 5 minutes.
Mr. Panetta. Thank you, Madam Chair, I appreciate this
opportunity to be here to have this hearing. Gentlemen, thanks
for being here. I appreciate it as well. Thank you for dealing
with the ups and downs of this pandemic, be it this hearing, be
it the administration of the CFAP, so I appreciate that.
Secretary Ibach, it was good to talk to you about a month
ago where we were able to talk about the CFAP, and the USDA's
release of the CFAP, so I appreciate that opportunity. I am
also glad that both of you are here today so that we can,
obviously, learn more about how the USDA has administered the
purchase component of the CFAP. And that being, obviously, the
Farmers to Families Food Box Program. Given the obvious
unfortunate realities of this pandemic, that box was--obviously
heartened many people, and we had high hopes for it. However,
from my conversations, as you are hearing today, and as I am
sure you have heard over and over, there are some significant
issues that clearly need to be addressed, and that is why I
appreciate having this opportunity to talk to you today. But
obviously, as my good friend Mr. Davis just said, we want to be
able to work with you on it to make it better, because we do
know that there is a lot of potential there for it to be
better, and for it to help so many people of all backgrounds.
Now, the issue that I have heard over and over is based on
the fact that this program is centered around distributors, and
this has led to some serious issues, logistical issues, as well
as some issues of equity as well. And by asking distributors to
reach out to food banks and other nonprofits, it seems that
there were certain vulnerable communities, our most vulnerable,
that weren't getting the necessary distribution of these types
of benefits. In some cases we felt like we were working
against, rather than with, existing local relationships, and
that led to a failing to address critical last mile issues to
ensure that the food actually got from the farmer to the
family. But, like I said, I do appreciate all the work that you
have put into this program, and I do want to work to help to
share some stories from my communities, and ultimately make
this program better and stronger. We all do, and that is
definitely one of the main purposes of this hearing.
Under Secretary Ibach, can you speak to how USDA worked to
ensure equitable access to this program? Not just across
regions, but within certain communities?
Mr. Ibach. I think that is an area that, in the speed that
we tried to roll out the program, putting emphasis on the
things we did, the capability of actually the contractor to
pack a food box, acquire food, pay for food, and do that, and
expected them to identify those people to distribute through or
to work with through the distribution that some contractors did
a great job of trying to blanket the areas. Others picked the
easy fruit, and that is an area that we could work together
with the contractors, as we identify people that want to
participate, to try to point them in the future, and do better
there.
Mr. Panetta. Was there any sort of focus on under-served
areas, and how you would actually distribute to those
particular areas?
Mr. Ibach. Probably not specifically the way you are
asking. Once we did see the contracts that were awarded, and
evaluated where they planned to distribute, we were able to
identify regions of the country, or states, or parts of states
that were under-served, and so we took steps. We allocated just
recently 16 different contracts representing $218 million that
we directly went out and made direct contracting with, not
through an offer system, to say, please serve those areas.
Mr. Panetta. I got you. The program is not formula-based,
correct?
Mr. Ibach. No.
Mr. Panetta. Okay. Now, is it possible, and you may not
have this now, but could you provide a breakdown of the funding
that went to each food bank or nonprofit within each region?
Mr. Ibach. We would be able to provide a breakdown, very
easily, of which contractors participated in the program. We
would have to go to the contracts themselves to extract the
specific food bank or nonprofit that received those, if they
were enumerated in the contract. They could have just been
enumerated as eligible recipients, but we could do polling to
figure out who all received food.
Mr. Panetta. Understood, understood. Now, one thing I have
realized in going out and visiting each of my food banks
basically every week and helping with the food distribution is
not all food banks, even in my district, are the same. Some
have, like, Monterey County has a food bank cold storage of
30,000 capacity, whereas San Benito County doesn't have one
nearly close to that big. Did you guys take that into account
in working with distributors, and how they would bring certain
types of food to certain food banks?
Mr. Ibach. One of the things that we have identified as
something that we need to continue to work on is communicating
to the food banks, or to the recipients of the boxes, that they
actually have the power within this equation to tell the person
that is contracting with us to put together the food box what
they want, when they want it, and how they will take it. They
do not have to provide the cold storage, or the last mile
distribution if they don't want to, but it would affect the
ability of the contractor to put together the number of boxes
they offered us, and they are only paid based on the boxes that
they actually deliver successfully.
Mr. Panetta. Understood. I am out of time.
The Chair. Thank you.
Mr. Panetta. Gentlemen, thank you. I yield back.
The Chair. Mr. Thompson is not with us. Mr. Scott, you are
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Gentlemen, thank you for being here today, and I want to tell
you, more has gone right than wrong with the food distribution
in the last several months. Nobody could have prepared for
this, unless they had already been through it before, and we
haven't been through this before. I want to give a lot of
credit to a couple of people. Chef V in Tift County Schools,
Ms. Vanessa Hayes, she did a wonderful job of keeping people
fed. We have also got a great mission there called Peanut
Butter and Jesus. Tony McBrayer would be embarrassed that I
mentioned his name with that, but I will tell you, in Tift
County, and the key to feeding especially the kids was the
coordination among the school systems and the other not-for-
profits that were out there working. And so, if you had a
community that was a close--that was close, within walking
distance to school in Tift County, those who had vehicles and
were carrying--would carry the food into the other communities,
and that is something that I am very proud of my hometown and
my local community, for how they worked together with the
school system and the other not-for-profits to carry out the
mission.
I am also proud of Second Harvest. I know that something
was said about the accuracy of the food box distribution. And,
obviously, this is a pretty big food bank, and when they pack
those boxes, they are packed with canned fruits, canned
vegetables, rice, other things. All that we would buy and feed
our family, but not necessarily, but it wasn't fresh, it was
all packaged. One of the things that they asked for, and were
given, that helped expedite the food delivery was the simple
waiver of the signature when they hand somebody a box, that you
don't have to sign saying that you are eligible. And I can tell
you, as many people as we had in my part of the world that were
needing those boxes, where literally we had the Georgia
National Guard out handing out the boxes, the ability to hand
the family the box, and then to let them drive on off in their
vehicle, it helped expedite the process. Whatever the error
rate may be is much offset by how fast it allowed us to get
people the food. And I can tell you the majority of the people
in those lines that were long enough would not have waited had
they not needed the food, whether they were technically
eligible for it or not, so I appreciate that.
The difference I see in the farmers' market boxes, that is
exactly what anybody with unlimited resources, if they went
into the fanciest grocery store in America, would buy and take
home to feed their family. And so I looked at those boxes, went
to Atlanta with Secretary Perdue, I was very proud of what was
happening there too. At the same time, it breaks my heart to
know that dairy farmers that I know were dumping thousands of
gallons of milk. Vegetable farmers literally couldn't get paid
enough for the labor to harvest the crops. And what we have to
do is recognize we have had a tremendous supply chain breakdown
in this country, and we need to make sure that we learn from
that.
And I want to say one final thing. The American farmer gets
about 10  on the dollar of what we spend on our groceries. When
you look at the price of the current commodities that are
sitting out there today, I think that we have the potential of
widespread bankruptcies among the American farmers over the
next several months if something is not done in the next
coronavirus package. Corn is $3 a bushel. I mean, 5 years ago
it was $6. If you look at the price of cotton, if you look at
every single commodity group out there, everything we eat
starts with the farmer. And of what has been done in the $4
trillion that has been either done by the Fed, or done by us in
Congress, the American farmer, of that $4 trillion, it was
somewhere around $20 billion total. Now, you do that math, and
that comes out to about \1/2\ of 1 percent, if I am not
mistaken. And so I am very concerned that, as we go forward
through the end of the year, if there is not a bounce back in
commodity prices, and we haven't done something as Congress,
that we are going to go into the 2021 year with a lot fewer
farmers, and a lot fewer people planting those crops that we
depend on, regardless of what your income level is.
With that, Madam Chair, I appreciate what you have done, I
appreciate this Committee and the work on feeding people, and
as I look forward, I hope that we learn from the challenges
that we have been through.
Mr. Ibach. Thank you, sir.
The Chair. Thank you. Mr. Costa, you are recognized for 5
minutes.
Mr. Costa. Thank you very much, Madam Chair, for this
important Subcommittee hearing, and to be sitting in on--just
to take off on our last colleague's comments, in H.R. 6800,
HEROES Act (Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency
Solutions Act) we do have an additional $16\1/2\ billion to
provide support, which would put us, the way I add numbers up,
from what we have done thus far, about $40 billion in total,
although I have told the Secretary of Agriculture, Mr. Perdue,
that somewhere in the neighborhood of 60+ as we try to do a
safety net over the next year, because this is going to last
for the next year. Anybody who thinks otherwise is fooling
themselves. Included in that is funding for farmworkers for
safety, and those workers, essential workers all of them, in
our food processing facilities, whether they be our meat,
poultry, or whether they be in packing houses, or other
processing facilities. Without the workers, we can't provide
food on America's dinner table, and we must be mindful of that.
The workers are essential, and we know the parlance.
But, I want to talk about the issue of the regional
disparities with the Food Box Program. We think in the West
there has been not as much access to meat and dairy. Half the
West's allocation was in fresh produce. Of course, we grow half
the nation's fresh produce, so that is to be understood, but we
are also, in California, the number one dairy state, with 20
percent of the dairy production. I have been, anecdotally,
hearing some people say on the Food Box Program that, while we
produce a great deal of milk products, that they are selling
milk there that is produced in Oregon. And I like Oregonians,
but we have had our own supply problems.
The contractor contact information publicly available to
producers to get in touch and work collaborative with getting
the products included in the box has been lacking, even though
the program was advertised to help producers in the first
place. What, under the lessons learned, can you see that we can
do that? And, if there is a second allocation of CFAP 2.0, will
that be included in the Food Box Program?
Mr. Ibach. First of all, to maybe address your question
about dairy, that is probably, if we looked at the categories
of boxes, that would be the category of boxes that are least
fulfilled, based on what we had allocated to those contractors.
Mr. Costa. Are we looking to address that in the second
round?
Mr. Ibach. Part of that, though, isn't necessarily that
they failed to execute their contracts. Part of it is the
marketplace changed, the price of milk and cheese changed, and
the retail industry pulled those products out of where they
were accessible to our contractors, and demanded them in the
retail space. And so we need to figure out how we provide the
necessary dairy products, but also not disrupt the regular
marketplace. And so we are working on that, and we continue to
want to do that.
Mr. Costa. And we have experiences where we have large
experienced packers and shippers that have tried to apply, but
we have only had one mid-sized shipper that got a contract in
our area. Are you trying to provide greater opportunities for
that to happen?
Mr. Ibach. I think that is partly providing more time for
people to apply, and their--and to put together their
proposals. Also we plan to do at least two webinars, I believe,
in the upcoming bid process to help people understand the
program. I think some of the----
Mr. Costa. My time is going.
How about under the Good Agricultural Practices, that
certification progress? Many feel--burdensome for farmers to
get a chance to participate.
Mr. Ibach. GAP certification is part of a food safety
concern that we have to make sure that we continue to assure
that any products distributed would be safe.
Mr. Costa. You looking to make any adjustments?
Mr. Ibach. I think that food safety will continue to be a
priority and emphasis.----
Mr. Costa. It should be.
Yes. I don't think anybody disagrees there. On the USDA
requirement program, the offer should describe it is intended
to engage small farmers for those farms servicing local and
regional interests. My concern is that there really hasn't been
metrics that have been engaged here, and I don't know how you
can re-evaluate the effort without some level of metrics to
evaluate how and what assurances are provided. What are you
looking for in trying to develop in this next effort?
Mr. Ibach. Some of the other Members have asked, we do set-
asides for small or medium. We set some incentives within the
contracting process for them to source locally, which we
thought would help with that. But the main focus of the program
was to put a program together quickly that got food out
quickly, and so attending to all those details was impossible.
Mr. Costa. But are you looking at which farmers are helping
in what region by region basis, in terms of trying to make sure
that that product is being availed?
Mr. Ibach. We try to set within the contracting parameters
encouragement for them to source locally when possible.
Understanding that, at the time the program started, California
and the South had great access to crops that were growing in
the fields. The northern part of the U.S., obviously, their
season is behind, they didn't have the same access at that
time.
The Chair. Thank you. The gentleman's time has expired.
Thank you, Mr. Costa.
Mr. Costa. Thank you, Madam Chair.
The Chair. Mr. Kelly, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Mr.
Kelly, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. Kelly. Thank you, Madam Chair. The Ranking Member
mentioned Borden Dairy. I want to bring light to the fact that
Extra Table, an organization in Mississippi, relayed that this
is the first year in its history that it was able to provide
fresh milk to the food banks and soup kitchens it serves
throughout Mississippi.
First and foremost, Mr. Under Secretary, thank you for
taking the time to come to my home state in November of 2018
and 2019. We appreciate your time and interest in the
commodities that we grow in Mississippi. I also appreciate you
taking time to be here today.
Farmers to Families works, and my colleagues have pointed
this out repeatedly. I would like to switch gears and talk a
little bit about other areas of CFAP that are important to my
state. We appreciate the work that USDA is doing to implement
the intent of Congress in helping our farmers and ranchers
feeling the impact of COVID-19 on their operations throughout
CFAP. This program has been a lifeline for many farms that have
been dealt a horrible blow. One of your USDA mission agencies,
Agricultural Marketing Services, is heavily involved in working
with the Farm Service Agency, as they implement the specialty
crop segment of this important program.
The sweet potato industry in Mississippi is a major
economic engine in our state, located mostly in my
Congressional district. Many of my sweet potato farmers had
contracts to sell the 2019 crops to wholesalers and restaurants
that were canceled before April 15 due to the impact of
coronavirus, and now they have no market to sell their produce.
USDA has told these farmers that they do not qualify for CFAP
because the potatoes did not perish immediately because they
were in storage at the time. As the 2020 crop is quickly
approaching, these farmers are about to have to destroy their
2019 crops in storage to make room for their 2020 harvest
seasons. To me, it makes no difference whether it perished at
the time, or there is no market, and we have to throw it away.
Can you tell me if USDA will re-look at this rule and do what
is right by my farmers in my district?
Mr. Ibach. There was the original prices that we were able
to analyze to determine loss or damage, and we published those
to make those crops eligible. Since then there has been a NOFA
process, where different commodities could apply through the
NOFA process. I don't know where we are at, necessarily, I
apologize, on sweet potatoes, whether or not their NOFA has
been completely analyzed, and what determination has been made.
I will get back to you on that.
Mr. Kelly. Yes, and please do, Mr. Secretary, because the
net effect is they had potatoes, they store for a long time,
but the next crop is coming in, which means they eat the entire
year's crop, and so any help, I mean, that meets the intent of
what we are trying to do with CFAP, and sometimes our rules and
regulations, and we have to look and, listen, I have been in
the Army a long time, and I have been around government
bureaucracy, and sometimes we look at things, but we have to
get to the intent of the law, and I would really appreciate
that.
I do thank you for your service. It is working. It is not
perfect, but I appreciate you being on the conference calls,
and being here today, and visiting my state. You guys are doing
a great job, just keep it up, unless--as an old general told me
a long time ago, General Scott, who was the Assistant Division
Commander of the 1st Cavalry Division, he said, ``Good, better,
best, good get better, and better get best.'' And, Mr. Under
Secretary, we hope USDA will keep getting good, better, and
best. And thank you, and I yield back.
The Chair. Thank you. Ms. Spanberger, you are recognized
for 5 minutes.
Ms. Spanberger. Thank you, Chair Fudge, for allowing me to
waive onto the Subcommittee today for this important oversight
hearing. Mr. Ibach, I want to thank you by expressing my
appreciation for the speed with which USDA implemented the
Farmers to Families Food Box Program. Not only has the program
alleviated food waste, but it has helped those facing food
insecurity receive aid at this critical moment. That said, I am
concerned about some of the ways in which this program has been
implemented, and on June 15 I sent a letter to Secretary Perdue
regarding the geographic disparities present in the program's
rollout during the first wave of contracts. Madam Chair, I ask
unanimous consent to enter a copy of that letter, and the June
29 response from Secretary Perdue, into the record.
The Chair. Without objection.
[The letter referred to is located on p. 70.]
Ms. Spanberger. Under the first rounds of awards, Virginia
received nearly 3 million fewer pounds of food than would have
been expected if the program had been administered under the
formula utilized by TEFAP, which distributes food relief
proportionately to a state's needs. While it is my
understanding that the agency is doing more to address these
discrepancies, I was concerned to see that not acknowledged is
one of the challenges and lessons learned that you identified
in your testimony. For my constituents this issue is a looming
one, and remains so, and according to USDA provided statistics,
Virginia remains near the bottom of states in terms of food
delivered per person.
I know many of my colleagues have asked about this question
so far today, so I don't want to revisit some of the
discussion, and I thank you for bringing forward your answers
to their questions. But I do want to specifically ask, why did
USDA elect not to utilize a need-based formula like the one
used under TEFAP when distributing this aid?
Mr. Ibach. That is an excellent question, and it was a new
program that, from inception, or our first thought about it, to
when the first food box was being distributed was about 40 days
and 40 nights, Bruce likes to say, with an intended reference
there. But, we did it quickly. Our concern, or our wonder was
who would apply, would we have a sufficient amount of
contractors that wanted to participate in the program? And so,
rather than set regional or state thresholds, we wanted to be
able to get food out.
As a commodity farmer, I realize that a bushel of displaced
corn, whether it is sold out of Nebraska or sold out of
California, is a bushel of displaced corn, and it works the
same way in the fruit and vegetable industry. And our goal was
to get food circulating in the system to try to stabilize
prices for farmers, to try to stop waste, and have food moving
as we fed families. And so it was imperfect in its design, but
our goal and intent was pure, and I hope noble.
Ms. Spanberger. Thank you very much for that answer. And,
following up, to be clear, I appreciate the program very much.
It has helped many hungry Americans, as well as farmers and
producers, but to follow up on the discussion, and in your
answer you were discussing the concern about who might apply,
what contractors might apply to participate in the program.
Before the rounds of contracts went out, did USDA conduct any
outreach to individual food banks, or food bank networks, to
assess their needs, level of increased demands, or any other
concerns? And, recognizing the 40 days, 40 nights, now that the
program has been implemented, we have a little bit of time and
space, what has USDA done since then with any additional
outreach to food banks, including those particularly hard
impacted, under-served areas?
Mr. Ibach. We did reach out, as we were designing the
program, to the fruit and vegetable industry, to the dairy
industry, to understand how they might perceive this type of a
program to work for them. We also worked with them as they
reached out to food banks to say, ``We would like to work with
you on this program.'' We had conversations with food banks as
well in that process. We have learned a lot in the input we
have had as we have gone through this. Part of it is the
education process for understanding that the people receiving
the boxes, that wanted to participate in distributing the
boxes, had more power in that process than sometimes they
exerted, and we want them to continue to know that they do have
the ability to influence their service, and how they are
served, by accepting or not accepting the boxes.
Ms. Spanberger. And, Mr. Ibach, thank you for being here. I
am running out of time, but I do want to implore you that, in
the future, to engage a little bit more aggressively than what
we have seen in the immediacy of the crisis, particularly with
food banks and our food bank networks. From what we are hearing
in Virginia, that would be really helpful on the ground. Thank
you for your work thus far, and I look forward to seeing
greater contact with those entities. Thank you.
Mr. Ibach. Well, we definitely wanted to engage food banks,
but we also wanted to provide opportunities for community-based
organizations, faith-based organizations, and other
organizations that we knew would be in contact with needy
people to be able to participate too on a level field with the
food banks.
Ms. Spanberger. Absolutely. Thank you, sir.
The Chair. Ms. Pingree, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
Ms. Pingree. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. First, thank
you for holding this hearing. It has been a great opportunity
to hear how this program has been working. And, to Secretary
Ibach, thank you for being with us today, and to your many
answers for questions. I wanted to start by saying I share so
many of the things that my colleagues have already said,
questions too that you have answered. I, like Mr. Peterson,
think we should have just done a SNAP increase all along. It
would have been more efficient, and certainly it allows more
dignity for the families who are allowed to go shopping on
their own. I also had hoped that we could have just directed
this money to the food banks. They are better able to deal with
many of the problems that we have been talking about today, and
also to make sure, when it comes to procuring from the farmers,
that they know who to get their food from. Maine, as you know,
and we have heard from other New Englanders, did not get any
food in the first round, and we are able, thank you, to have
another round, and so now we do have two contractors serving
Maine, but we are still third from the bottom on the list in
number of customers served, and that continues to be a concern.
I hope that progress can be made in that, given that there are
now more contracts.
I want to just focus my concern on the farmers. Part of the
reason this program is there is because of the huge challenges
with the supply chain that many others have mentioned, and the
idea was to make sure that farmers who had big surpluses were
getting their food into these boxes. Also, as you mentioned,
there was criteria in making sure that local farmers were able
to participate. We have heard a lot about that not being
followed, and so one of my questions is whether you have data
on who was actually awarded, who did the contractees purchase
from? I know you have said, and I know that was part of the
criteria, that they had to look at local and engaging small
farmers, but we don't have any data at this point to know if
that happened. Do you collect that data? Is there more
information we could receive?
Mr. Ibach. We have not collected that data as part of our
verification process at this time. I do know anecdotally, when
I was at the different places that I visited that actually had
a growing seasons that was harvesting, that there has been an
attempt made by those people constructing the boxes to include
local fruits and vegetables at that time.
The contract does not require them to tell us who they are
purchasing the food from. We can survey to be able to, and many
of the cooperators and contractors are very cooperative about
working with us, and being transparent, and helping us
understand how they put together their boxes. They are very
proud of their boxes in many cases, and so we could do some
work there over time to help understand that better.
Ms. Pingree. Well, thank you for that response. I guess I
would just put in a plug for the Committee to ask for that, and
for you to consider doing that. And perhaps in future contracts
there would be an appropriate way to have some oversight on
that, because, again, this program was based on making sure
that where we had surpluses, that food was going to go into
these boxes, and in my region, one of the things we are
particularly concerned about is we have a lot of small to
medium-sized farmers who weren't able to get the direct
assistance due to a whole variety of things, and the
seasonality of their harvest, and so it didn't work into the
money that came from the USDA, so this seemed like a pretty
good opportunity for them to be able to supply this food. I
would encourage you to do that surveying so that we can look
into the future, have a better idea of how much local food was
accessed, and also to make sure that, where there was the
greatest need and oversupply, it was going to the right places.
Just one other thing that we heard from some of the food
banks. Because local farmers weren't as engaged, and many of
them procure from local farmers for their food banks, and have
funding for that, there have been certain amounts of oversupply
as the food is now coming in through the food boxes because it
is not calculated to sort of take into account what is
plentiful in our area at the same time, so I guess I want to
mention that. I also just will use my last 20 seconds to put in
a plug for something that other Members have asked for, and
that is to understand better what nonprofits and food banks did
get this food to make sure that they were all legitimate, using
criteria, but also it would be important information to have
out there so that people in need who wanted to access the food
banks knew where to go. And, since that is not readily
available, I hope that that will be something else you provide.
With that, I yield back, and I thank you, and I thank again the
Chair for having this hearing.
The Chair. Thank you very, very much. We want to thank you
for your testimony today. Mr. Johnson, do you have any closing
comments?
Mr. Johnson. Yes, a few things, thank you, ma'am. First
off, I would just say continue to use your audit and
accountability functions to make sure that we are getting a
good result. I mean, I have heard from the field concerns about
that last mile delivery system by the distributor, particularly
in rural areas. Some of these folks bit off maybe a bit more
than they realized, so continue to make progress on that.
For my colleagues that are calling for, that we shouldn't
have done this box program, we should have done SNAP, well,
SNAP is a tremendous program, and it has a huge role to play
here, but it is important during these unprecedented emergency
times that we deploy a diverse set of tools. SNAP is incredibly
helpful. We know that SNAP has scaled. We know that six million
more people got on SNAP from February to April, and we know the
spend is up, so SNAP can meet a portion of this demand, but it
can't meet it all, we have been talking about farmers dumping
milk. They weren't dumping milk because there wasn't demand.
They were dumping milk because traditional distribution systems
were broken. As we have talked about, the food supply chain was
strained, and in some ways broken, and if we wanted to reduce
food waste, and we do, and if we want to drive down hunger, and
we do, we couldn't just rely on the same grocery story system
that was strained and was breaking.
And so, to those of you at USDA, you provided another
diverse set, or another opportunity to help producers, and to
help hungry Americans. And you talk about 40 days and 40
nights, and as you alluded to, some of those nights probably
were working nights rather than resting nights, and in the days
since then your efforts have made a real impact. I will just
close by saying this. There is still tremendous economic
uncertainty in farm and ranch country, and throughout America
for families. That economic uncertainty is lower today than it
would have been but not for your efforts, so thank you.
The Chair. Thank you, and I will close as well. I just am
confused about the people who sit on the other side of the
aisle. They are just being so nice about there being no
accountability. We have no idea whether these people have done
what they were supposed to do, but they are all, it doesn't
cease to amaze me the hypocrisy that I listen to. When I ask
about accountability in another program, they will say it is
freedom, just freedom. Now, that doesn't count when people are
hungry or needy, this whole freedom idea. We talk about less
government. Now we have more government than we have ever had.
We create a whole other bureaucracy. We tell them what they can
and cannot eat in SNAP. Now we are going to give them what we
want to give them in boxes. I am confused, I really am, because
I do not understand how they can sit here straight-faced and
tell you how wonderful this is. We have no idea what you are
doing, nor do you, because you can't answer the questions.
So, I would just suggest if we are going to continue to do
this program, at least be able to give us some answers. Who is
getting the food? Are they giving them rotten food, which is
what I am hearing in some of these instances. Are you paying
for somebody to really give it to people who should have it? We
have none of those answers. This is fraught with waste, fraud,
and abuse. And so I am hopeful just as we go forward that you
can at least give us some of the answers we asked you for
today, and understand that even people who are poor or who are
hungry still have dignity, and they should be allowed to buy
and feed their families what they choose.
And so, I would think that you might want to think about
maybe just increasing SNAP a little bit more. We have kids who
are not in school--not that I think it probably is that bad
because you don't allow us to put nutritious food into
schools--but we want less government.
With that, I will close and end this panel. Thank you so
much.
Ms. Hayes. [presiding.] The Subcommittee will stand at
recess pending technical issues.
[Recess]
Ms. Hayes. The recess is ended, the hearing will come to
order. Mr. Cooper?
Mr. Cooper. Yes, ma'am?
Ms. Hayes. Hi. Thank you. Please begin with your testimony.

STATEMENT OF ERIC S. COOPER, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF
EXECUTIVE OFFICER, SAN ANTONIO FOOD BANK, SAN
ANTONIO, TX

Mr. Cooper. You bet. Thank you. Distinguished Members of
the Committee, my name is Eric Cooper. I am the President and
CEO of the San Antonio Food Bank. I am one of the food banks in
the Feeding America and Feeding Texas food bank networks. I
serve a large section of southwest Texas, where I have the
privilege of partnering with well over 500 different nonprofit
charities, of which the majority are faith-based organizations.
We also work with school districts and other organizations in
feeding, pre-COVID, about 60,000 people each week. Now, at the
onset of the COVID-19 crisis that number moved to 120,000
people a week. Now, we feed those families through our partner
pantries, and then our pop-up distributions. It is these pop-up
distributions that the truck to trunk model was based on. They
are significant events, and take lots of logistics. You could
imagine the coordination of bringing some extra gas and gas
cans for cars that run out of fuel, jumper cables for cars that
break down, making sure that you have hydration stations in the
heat of south Texas, port-a-potties, lots and lots of
volunteers, and then serving thousands of families. I want to
thank our local Congressional delegation, who has shown up in
big ways to help us with these distributions, and our outgoing
Congressman Hurd has loaded a lot of trunks, and he will be
missed.
When I am at those distributions, and see the great work
that is coming from our community to feed these families, I
check in with our staff and volunteers, but then I walk the
lines to greet the families. Many of these families lost their
jobs in our hospitality industry. One couple met at the hotel
where they both worked. They were called in to work on the same
day, and let go. They and their three children, not knowing how
they are going to nourish their kids, were in that line to get
food.
The program to rescue the food service supply chain and to
help families should be applauded. I am personally grateful for
USDA in initiating this program because I do believe it is a
huge success, but there is some opportunity to tighten up, some
opportunity to improve, and in two specific areas it would be
in equity and accountability. When it comes to equity, it is
equity between those that got food and those that didn't,
equity between those that got paid and those that didn't. Some
areas got a lot of produce, some got zero. Some got dairy, some
got none. Having no distribution plan, with just a thought to
work with any 501(c)(3), seemed a little willy-nilly. It does
not honor the planning and logistics that go into these last
mile distributions, the food safety that goes along with it,
and the expenses. Many Feeding America food banks had to raise
funds from private philanthropy to support this public program.
Specifically, when it comes to accountability, food banks
in the Feeding America network know how to read a bill of
lading. They understand audits. From many of the contractors
there wasn't significant data on the bill of lading to know
what you would be signing for and what you were not. Working
with a local contractor here in San Antonio, we struggled to
meet basic things, like labeling. Some of the protein boxes,
which should have been a diverse variety of protein, contained
five 5 pound boxes of peppered chicken labeled for commercial
use. Families didn't know the heating instructions. We had to
reach out to the manufacturer, which was in California, to get
heating instructions to include in all the boxes we
distributed.
Oftentimes details come down to the corrugated box. The box
didn't have enough air, so the produce rotted. Onions competed
with cantaloupes, and many of the cantaloupes were rotten. We
wish the contractor would have substituted those cantaloupes
with some of those sweet potatoes mentioned earlier, or they
just pulled out the cantaloupe. More opportunity to get
families out of the parking lot and into grocery stores is
ultimately what is needed, and this will happen when the
economy strengthens, and people go back to living wages. But
until then, I would encourage boosting SNAP 15 percent. The
heat of south Texas has families struggling in these parking
lots, and we would all be better served to move them out of
these parking lots and into grocery stores, where they can shop
for the nutritious food.
Thank you so much for the opportunity to share some thought
on this matter. From all of us in San Antonio, muchas gracias.

Prepared Statement of Eric S. Cooper, President and Chief Executive
Officer, San Antonio Food Bank, San Antonio, TX
Coronavirus Food Assistance Program's Farmers to Families Food Box
Delivery to Nonprofits
Dear Chair Fudge, Ranking Member Johnson, and distinguished Members
of the Committee:

Thank you for the opportunity to share testimony on our experience
with the Farm[ers] to Families Food Box Program. My name is Eric
Cooper. I am the President and CEO of the San Antonio Food Bank, in San
Antonio Texas. I represent one of the food banks in the Feeding America
and Feeding Texas networks. We serve a large section of Southwest Texas
where we provide food to well over 500 organizations and programs.
At the onset of the COVID-19 Crisis, we went from feeding 60,000
people per week to now feeding 120,000 people a week. The reality of
the demand was captured in a photograph in the San Antonio Express News
of our April 5th distribution at Traders Village. Over 10,000 families
struggling to get food needed help. It has been this unprecedented
demand that food banks across the nation have been working hard to
feed.
It has taken an unprecedented response to meet that demand and we
are grateful to the Companies, Foundations, Churches, and Individuals
who have donated and volunteered. Their immediate action helped to
bridge the gap until the public support started to arrive. I want to
thank our Local Federal Delegation for volunteering at our
distributions and advocating for support. Had it not been for the Texas
Department of Emergency Management, FEMA, and USDA we would have run
out of food.
Meeting this demand has been a daily challenge. Food insecurity is
getting worse as unemployment rises across the country as more and more
states look at needing to close again. Feeding America's research team
has projected an additional 17.1 million individuals will be food-
insecure in 2020 as a result of the economic fallout from COVID-19.
The San Antonio Food Bank, and the entire food bank network, is
grateful for the additional funding for TEFAP, TEFAP Storage and
Distribution, Pandemic-EBT, and SNAP emergency allotments provided in
the Families First and CARES Act. This has immensely helped food banks
and those they serve in communities across the country, and in
particular the additional food will help provide a backstop this fall
and winter.
Food banks across the country viewed USDA's announcement of the
Farmers to Families Food Boxes as an innovative solution to the supply
chain challenges many growers and producers are experiencing due to
COVID-19, and a solution that would also help connect additional food
with communities in need. USDA took a chance on standing up an entirely
new purchasing system in a very fast turnaround time to address the
food that many farmers were forced to plow under as buyers canceled
contracts.
However, this haste did cause some unevenness in the bidding and
contracting process. Many contractors did not have time to identify and
negotiate distribution and delivery agreements with nonprofits ahead of
time. This led to some speed bumps once contracts were awarded to avoid
duplication of deliveries in certain areas. It also resulted in food
banks shouldering more of the distribution burden than USDA had
intended. Many food banks have hired additional staff, rented warehouse
and refrigeration space, and rented trucks to handle the additional
food. Other food banks have not been able to afford to invest in these
additional capabilities and have had to turn some of the food offered
through the program down due to lack of capacity.
Bolstering TEFAP will also help to offset deep declines in retail
and other food donations, especially as food banks face extra costs
related to new food delivery models that align with guidance from
health professionals. With the increase in food moving through the
network from USDA's Food Purchase and Distribution Program and the
[Farmers] to Famil[ies] Program, a strain is being placed on the food
bank infrastructure.
The San Antonio Food Bank cannot work alone in providing the
support our community needs during this critical time. We need an
increase in SNAP to help with the increased demand. SNAP has proven to
be key to safeguarding the food security of Americans who are low-
income in times of need for decades, and its strength is unparalleled.
Strengthening SNAP will help make the program even more responsive to
the economic downswing the nation is presently facing. It will assist
in moving families from our parking lots and into grocery stores.
To meet this increased level of need it is crucial that funding be
included in future legislation that increases access to food through
SNAP, TEFAP, and child nutrition programs.

On behalf of Feeding America and Food-Insecure Families we ask:

Increase the maximum SNAP benefits for all recipients by
increasing the Thrifty Food Plan by at least 15 percent for as
long as the economy is weak. This will help food banks that are
seeing large increases in demand and also will help promote
economic stimulus during this economic downturn.

Increase the SNAP minimum benefit from $16 to $30 for the
duration of the economic downturn.

Extend Pandemic-EBT authority provided in earlier
legislation to ensure USDA has the authority needed to continue
this important program through the summer and into the next
school year as needed.

Provide $500 million for TEFAP food purchases to follow the
increases included in previous legislation as well as funding
for storage and distribution needs to help our food bank
network continue to meet the unprecedented demand in our
communities.

Provide $543.25 million for food bank infrastructure
capacity needs to support the rental, lease, or purchase of
essential assets such as refrigeration and transportation
equipment across the network of food banks and partner
distribution agencies.
Recommendations for Improving CFAP
We applaud the investment of $3 Billion to procure surplus
agriculture, strengthen food industry vendors, and feed families. Not
having a strong distribution plan and allowing awarded contractors
determine who and how much each nonprofit [501(c)(3)] challenged the
equity and accountability of the Farm[ers] to Families Food Box
Program.

Food Access: We recommend that USDA expands the reach of the
program so that all communities and states are able to
participate equitably in the program. Several states were left
with few to no food boxes while others received one type of box
(i.e., produce) while receiving none of the other varieties
(i.e., dairy and meat). This could also create opportunities
for national and local partners with experience distributing
food.

Contractor Support and Compliance: We recommend that USDA
increase technical assistance to contractors to ensure
familiarity with USDA contract requirements and successful
execution of the contract. Some contractors have experienced
difficulties that fall into these common areas:

The contractor did not secure agreement with
nonprofits for all the food they are contracted to deliver
prior to submitting a bid.

The contractor does not have the equipment needed to
deliver to distribution sites. This negates the ability of
the contractor to provide ``Truck to Trunk'' delivery to
distribution sites and means the food bank must take on the
expense to do so.

``Last Mile'' Distribution Costs: We recommend that USDA
support contractors in accurately assessing commodity and
delivery costs. Many contractors may not have known the true
distribution costs in the initial plans submitted to USDA;
allowing consideration of additional expenses will help
contractors either shoulder more of the distribution costs as
USDA intended in the RFP or compensate nonprofits for the last
mile delivery to clients. This will increase the reach of the
program.

Local Coordination: We recommend that USDA encourage
contractors to strengthen coordination with food banks and
other nonprofits. We have seen many instances where contractors
do not coordinate among the ``network'' of nonprofits for
delivery, resulting in some smaller nonprofits receiving food
they cannot safely distribute or store and then asking the food
bank to urgently pick up perishable food that has not be
handled according to proper food safety guidelines.
Closing Ask of USDA/Congress

We encourage the Committee on Agriculture along with USDA to
ensure the Farmers to Families Food Box Program can provide a
nationwide resource to individuals during this crisis and can
provide food to communities in need through all four phases of
the program (May-December) as announced by USDA in April.

We also encourage USDA and Congress to continue the success
of other USDA food purchase programs like the Food Purchase and
Distribution Program, which has provided over 2 billion pounds
of nutritious food to food banks over the last 2 years.
Unfortunately, this food is slated to end in December 2020,
creating a very large ``commodity cliff'' that will result in a
significant reduction in food purchases for food banks. We
believe another year of a planned food purchase program would
provide U.S. growers and producers as well as food banks
certainty and a steady supply of food to assist families and
individuals in need.

Thank you again for allowing me to give written testimony on our
direct experience. We are grateful to the Committee and USDA for making
sure families are nourished.
May God bless you all for serving our great nation in this time of
need!

Ms. Hayes. Thank you very much for your testimony. Mr.
Habash, please begin when you are ready.

STATEMENT OF MATT HABASH, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE
OFFICER, MID-OHIO FOODBANK, GROVE CITY, OH

Mr. Habash. Thank you, and good afternoon, Members of the
Committee. My name is Matt Habash, and I serve as the CEO of
the Mid-Ohio Food Collective, one of the largest hunger relief
organizations in the country, and the largest here in Ohio. We
serve a blended footprint of 20 counties in central and eastern
Ohio, which includes urban, rural, and Appalachia. Over the
past year we have served about 600,000 of our neighbors and
distributed almost 75 million pounds of food through a network
of 680 partner agencies. From March to June we distributed
almost 30 million pounds of food, a 30 percent increase in
comparison to the same time last year. We also had over 396,000
visits, including nearly 25,000 new families who have never
asked for help before--all made possible by the fact that 95
percent of our agencies remained open.
To highlight our relationship with the USDA, this past
fiscal year we distributed almost 20 million pounds of food
through TEFAP, CSFP, and ESFP. This is a testament to our
partnership, and a strong one. Thank you, also to Under
Secretary Ibach, who visited us yesterday to see our work. To
date, we have received 42,590 boxes, about 1.1 million pounds
of milk, dairy, vegetables, and fruit. I never got offered the
meat that Eric did. We are scheduled through August 2020 for
95,000 boxes and 2\1/2\ million pounds. While coordinating
deliveries in all 20 counties, we are particularly focused on
the rural counties. All the pre-planning in this program for us
was around identifying a single agency in the 18 counties that
we have outside of central, or right here in Columbus for local
distribution. Unfortunately, that didn't happen.
We are grateful to the suppliers and USDA for the amount
of, and the quality of, the products. CFAP has also helped in
supporting our food as health strategy to provide nutritious
food to customers as part of an overall health care. Along with
ensuring less food waste, the efficiencies of having food
packed and ready for delivery is key to a touch free system to
mitigate COVID-19 exposure. Transparency, there have been
certain issues with the program. Not all distributors can pack
and deliver the food as promised. When there are coordination
issues, it increases costs to food banks for storage and
distribution, straining the resources of food banks even more
when already working hard to provide the rapid response to the
30 percent increase in demand caused by COVID.
And also concerning is the fact it has been inequitable, in
access, in process, and in distribution around the country.
Frankly, many vendors are failing to adhere to their contracts,
creating logistical difficulties, and contributing to the
inequity. In addition, utilizing nonprofits outside of the food
distribution chain adds to coordination issues and creates
confusion, and I would say you heard a lot already in the
earlier panel about safety, and we are equally concerned about
that as well. Moving forward it is incumbent on USDA to
strengthen its communications with partners to streamline the
process and ensure success, a goal we all seek. In my written
testimony I have included national information to provide a
larger context.
In short, incorporating more streamlined coordination,
transparent communications, and deeper accountability of the
program will go a long way in our collective efforts to help
feed families who are struggling to put food on their tables.
Looking at hunger relief overall, we know the most efficient
way to address food insecurity during this crisis is to
increase SNAP benefits. Increasing the SNAP Thrifty Food Plan
by at least 15 percent, and a minimum benefit from $16 to $30
for the duration of this public health threat will provide
economic boosts while fighting food insecurity. Extending the
P-EBT authority into the next school year, and extending the
multiple waivers and declarations tied to all anti-hunger
programs will help ensure access to food for families.
Providing an additional $500 million for TEFAP food storage and
distribution will help food banks continue to meet
unprecedented demand. And providing an additional $540 million
to support acquisition of essential equipment will ensure safe
food receipt and delivery. It is also imperative that National
Guard deployment at food banks continue. The pandemic decimated
our volunteer base that was 13,000 strong, and committed nearly
75,000 hours of service in our facility.
We are ready to help expand the CFAP's reach. Our
recommendations are, one, focus on strengthening food access.
This is not an equitable program. You heard from many parts of
the country who got a lot of food, and other parts of the
country who got next to none. Provide clarity on distribution
costs and responsibility of contractors. When it says truck to
trunk, that means take it to the site that it is supposed to,
not give it to the food bank. We don't--necessarily can say no
because of the fact that some food banks don't have the
resources to transport the food across their service
territories, especially given what is going on right now. And
continue to provide contract oversight to encourage contractors
to coordinate the work among nonprofit pantries to avoid
duplication of services.
We encourage Congress and the USDA to ensure this program
provides food for all four phases of the program. We stand
ready to support, and on behalf of the 600,000 people we help,
thank you.

Prepared Statement of Matt Habash, President and Chief Executive
Officer, Mid-Ohio Foodbank, Grove City, OH
Coronavirus Food Assistance Program's Farmers to Families Food Box
Delivery to Nonprofits
Dear Chair Fudge, Ranking Member Johnson, and distinguished Members
of the Committee:

Thank you for the invitation to testify at today's hearing on how
USDA's Coronavirus Food Assistance Program's Farmers to Families Food
Box Program is working in Ohio. My name is Matt Habash and I serve as
the CEO for the Mid-Ohio Food Collective, the largest hunger relief
organization in Ohio. To put our work in context, the Mid-Ohio Food
Collective, a customer-centric organization, is comprised of five
assets: Mid-Ohio Foodbank (its anchor asset), Mid-Ohio Farmacy, Mid-
Ohio Farm, Mid-Ohio Kitchen and Mid-Ohio Markets--all intended to meet
customers where they are. As the 12th largest food bank in the country,
we serve a blended footprint of 20 counties in central and eastern Ohio
that includes urban, rural, and Appalachian areas. Over the past year,
the Mid-Ohio Collective served about 600,000 of our neighbors,
distributing a record high, almost 75 million pounds of food through a
network of more than 680 partner agencies.
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, our food bank has seen
continued and unprecedented demand, like our partner food banks across
the country. As so many Ohioans are seeking food assistance for the
first time in their lives, the Mid-Ohio Food Collective is working in
whole new ways to connect nutritious food to struggling families,
displaced workers, children who depended on meals at school, isolated
and health-compromised seniors, and to homeless men, women, and
children. Since the beginning of March through June 30, 2020, we have
responded to 396,367 visits across our 20 county urban, rural, and
Appalachia footprint, including, providing a rapid response in serving
an increase of 24,783 new families seeking nutritious food to feed
themselves and their families. Additionally, our food bank has
distributed 29.04 million pounds of food from March through June, a 30
percent increase from the same period last year, breaking record after
record in food provided to our neighbors and will end its fiscal year
with a distribution of more than 73 million pounds of food. Based on
the current trajectory, we expect food insecurity to continue to rise
as the coronavirus continues to greatly impact our day-to-day lives.
According to research projections by Feeding America, our service area
will most likely experience a 38 percent increase in food insecurity
due to the economic impact of COVID-19.
While we have taken aggressive steps to ensure an adequate supply
of food, such as early acquisitions and utilization of offsite storage
units, we understand that COVID-19 is a marathon as well as a sprint,
and that we need to secure business, community, and government partners
to meet and sustain what we know will be a significant increased demand
for food--the most fundamental of basic needs. COVID-19 has caused
unprecedented supply chain disruptions as consumers shift to preparing
and eating food at home. This has resulted in significant food loss
from farmers, dairy producers and other food producers as consumers
shelter-at-home, purchasing more food from groceries, and restaurants
that normally purchase their food have experienced significantly
reduced demand or have closed. Due to these disruptions in the supply
chain, it is critical that the Federal nutrition programs continue to
be well-funded and strengthened in order to serve our customers and
food-insecure children, seniors, veterans and those struggling with
disabilities nationwide. The increases and program flexibility changes
in the CARES Act and Families First Act in TEFAP, SNAP and the child
nutrition programs meant that we are able to serve our neighbors in
safe and effective ways.
USDA and food banks frequently work together to connect surplus
food with individuals and families in need when USDA makes market
support commodity purchases through Section 32 and distributes the food
through The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP). Last year, USDA
commodities from Section 32 market support purchases, the Food Purchase
and Distribution Program, and TEFAP entitlement funding provided in the
farm bill resulted in 20.283 million pounds of food distributed through
our food bank. This is the backbone of our food supply, and without
TEFAP and USDA foods, we would not have been able to respond as we did
to the increased need caused by COVID-19. USDA's announcement of the
Farmers to Families Food Box program in May meant we would have an even
greater ability to get nutritious food onto the tables of those
individuals and families who need it most.
CFAP Experience at Mid-Ohio
We are incredibly grateful to have partnered with USDA over the
decades to ensure that no one in our communities go hungry. Regarding
CFAP specifically, we have worked with select partner food agencies in
our service area to distribute the CFAP food boxes. To date, we have
received 42,590 boxes equaling 1.115 million pounds of food, receiving
our first box on June 1st; through the next round of scheduled
deliveries for July-August, we expect to receive and distribute 95,710
boxes equaling 2.515 million pounds of fresh food. We have largely
focused on our rural and Appalachian counties, identifying a key agency
in 18 of our 20 counties to distribute the food boxes. Both the partner
agencies in our network and our customers appreciate the amount and
freshness of the food. The CFAP initiative has been helpful in
supporting our ``food is health,'' strategy--a high-value, low-cost
healthcare solution--to enhance access and provide nutritious food to
our customers. Along with ensuring less food waste, the efficiencies of
having the food packed and ready for delivery has been key as we
continue with a ``touch free'' system to mitigate COVID-19 exposure for
associates and customers.
Having said the above, there have also been a number of ``hiccups''
with the program--namely around program coordination, accountability,
and communications. Not all distributors are able to pack and deliver
the food as promised and while the food is appreciated, it does not
account for health concerns including allergies and other common
issues. Where there are coordination issues for packing and delivery of
the food, it actually has increased cost to the food banks for storage
and transportation, straining valuable resources. Moreover, more
accountability to ensure that the right food is getting to the right
place at the right time by the right entity will not only strengthen
the program but will give added confidence in the intention behind the
program. Moving forward, it will be incumbent on USDA to be transparent
and more robust in their communications with all partners engaged in
the program in an effort to streamline the process and ensure the
program's success--a goal that we are all seeking to reach. If the CFAP
program was administered via existing, experienced networks within
USDA, these frustrations would most likely have been mitigated and the
program overall, would have been more efficient and realize more
substantive results.
National Information
It's also important to note that we do not work in isolation to
address food insecurity in Ohio or across the country. The Mid-Ohio
Food Collective is a part of 13 food banks serving the state of Ohio,
and the 200 Feeding America-affiliated food banks in the United States,
working to serve the communities in which they live. Food banks have
seen an increase in demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, with an
average increase of 60 percent, and are experiencing similar challenges
and hurdles as you have heard here today. From March 1 to May 24, the
food banks in the Feeding America network distributed an estimated 1.3
billion meals to people facing hunger in the United States.
CFAP has created another option to get food to individuals across
the country, and to provide additional support to growers and producers
who are hurting due to the disruption in the food supply chain. As with
any new program this one has experienced some challenges as reported by
a number of food banks from the program's onset. Some food banks have
confirmed a lack of nationwide access to food, particularly in rural
areas thereby reducing the reach of CFAP into rural areas that have
been affected by the pandemic. Other food banks are successfully
working with local producers to get fresh produce to food banks.
Additionally, the consistency of the contractors of CFAP has led to
varying degrees of success nationwide. Contractors in some regions have
struggled with providing truck to trunk services and may have never
been a part of a large-scale food distribution before. Overwhelmingly,
the food banks that are receiving food through the Farmers to Families
Food Box Program are thankful for the additional food provided and ask
that USDA continue to provide nutritious food for food-insecure
individuals and families and continue to improve this program to assist
individuals for the duration of the year.
This program has the opportunity to play a crucial role alongside
TEFAP and SNAP to feed families we serve every day, while also
supporting U.S. agriculture.
Key Recommendations for the Next Stimulus Package
The food bank network is a critical part of the response to hunger
in our country, but we also know that the most efficient way to address
food insecurity during this crisis is to increase SNAP benefits for the
duration of the economic recovery. Before COVID-19, for every meal the
Feeding America network of food banks distributed on average, SNAP
provided nine. In these uncertain times, SNAP can help people
immediately while also providing an economic stimulus to local
economies, helping people and communities get back on their feet so
they don't have to rely on charitable or government assistance any
longer than necessary.

Increase the maximum SNAP benefits for all recipients by
increasing the Thrifty Food Plan by at least 15 percent for as
long as the economy is weak. This will help food banks that are
seeing large increases in demand and also will help promote
economic stimulus during this economic downturn.

Increase the SNAP minimum benefit from $16 to $30 for the
duration of the economic downturn.

Extend Pandemic-EBT authority provided in earlier
legislation to ensure USDA has the authority needed to continue
this important program through the summer and into the next
school year as needed.

Provide $500 million for TEFAP food purchases to follow the
increases included in previous legislation as well as funding
for storage and distribution needs to help our food bank
network continue to meet the unprecedented demand in our
communities.

Provide $543.25 million for food bank infrastructure
capacity needs to support the rental, lease, or purchase of
essential assets such as refrigeration and transportation
equipment across the network of food banks and partner
distribution agencies.
Key Recommendations for Improving CFAP
With any new program, there are opportunities to improve. We are
ready to help expand the program's reach through partnerships between
experienced food industry providers and food banks across the U.S.
Although the Farmers to Families Food Box Program is meant to be a
temporary program lasting May-December to address critical food supply
chain imbalances, we stand ready to work with USDA and contractors on
ways to strengthen this temporary program.
Our suggestions to USDA are to focus on strengthening food access,
provide clarity on distribution cost and responsibility of contractors,
and continue to provide contract oversight to encourage contractors to
coordinate among nonprofit partners to avoid duplication of food
distributions.

Food Access: We recommend that USDA expands the reach of the
program so that all communities and states are able to
participate equitably in the program. Several states were left
with few to no food boxes while others received one type of box
(i.e., produce) while receiving none of the other varieties
(i.e., dairy and meat). This could also create opportunities
for national and local partners with experience distributing
food.

Contractor Support and Compliance: We recommend that USDA
increase technical assistance to contractors to ensure
familiarity with USDA contract requirements and successful
execution of the contract. Some contractors have experienced
difficulties that fall into these common areas:

The contractor did not secure agreement with
nonprofits for all the food they are contracted to deliver
prior to submitting a bid.

The contractor does not have the equipment needed to
deliver to distribution sites. This negates the ability of
the contractor to provide ``Truck to Trunk'' delivery to
distribution sites and means the food bank must take on the
expense to do so.

``Last Mile'' Distribution Costs: We recommend that USDA
support contractors in accurately assessing commodity and
delivery costs. Many contractors may not have known the true
distribution costs in the initial plans submitted to USDA;
allowing consideration of additional expenses will help
contractors either shoulder more of the distribution costs as
USDA intended in the RFP or compensate nonprofits for the last
mile delivery to clients. This will increase the reach of the
program.

Local Coordination: We recommend that USDA encourage
contractors to strengthen coordination with food banks and
other nonprofits. We have seen many instances where contractors
do not coordinate among the ``network'' of nonprofits for
delivery, resulting in some smaller nonprofits receiving food
they cannot safely distribute or store and then asking the food
bank to urgently pick up perishable food that has not be
handled according to proper food safety guidelines.
Closing Ask of USDA/Congress

We encourage the Committee on Agriculture along with USDA to
ensure the Farmers to Families Food Box Program can provide a
nationwide resource to individuals during this crisis and can
provide food to communities in need through all four phases of
the program (May-December) as announced by USDA in April.

We also encourage USDA and Congress to continue the success
of other USDA food purchase programs like the Food Purchase and
Distribution Program, which has provided over 2 billion pounds
of nutritious food to food banks over the last 2 years.
Unfortunately, this food is slated to end in December 2020,
creating a very large ``commodity cliff'' that will result in a
significant reduction in food purchases for food banks. We
believe another year of a planned food purchase program would
provide U.S. growers and producers as well as food banks
certainty and a steady supply of food to assist families and
individuals in need.

Making real progress towards reducing COVID-19's impact on food
insecurity will require investing new resources toward increasing
access to food and allowing flexibilities within existing programs. I
encourage the Committee on Agriculture along with USDA to ensure the
Farmers to Families Food Box Program can provide a state by state,
nationwide resource to individuals during this crisis and can provide
food to communities in need through all four phases of the program as
announced by USDA in April. I also ask Congress to strengthen Federal
nutrition programs like SNAP and TEFAP for families affected by this
public health crisis. It has been my honor to testify today on behalf
of everyone we serve through the Mid-Ohio Food Collective and all of
its assets. We look forward to working with this Committee to ensure no
one goes to bed hungry. I look forward to answering your questions.
Thank you.

Matt Habash,
CEO, Mid-Ohio Food Collective.

The Chair [presiding.] Thank you. Let us see, where are we?
We will now begin Member questions. We will begin with Ms.
Adams. You are recognized for 5 minutes.
Ms. Adams. Thank you, Madam Chair.
The Chair. I am sorry, 3 minutes, Ms. Adams. 3 minutes.
Thank you.
Ms. Adams. Okay. Can you hear me? Thank you. Thank you to
our panelists today. I have heard from North Carolina
nonprofits and food banks, and, despite the Farmers to Families
Food Box Program being billed as a truck to trunk, vendors are
not necessarily storing and distributing the food provided, so,
as a result, these banks have been handling the logistics of
solving the costs of storage, et cetera. Are your organizations
handling the distribution and storage of the food boxes that
you have received, and have they, in terms of participating in
the program, had any impacts on their orders and other
programs? Can you hear me?
Mr. Habash. Yes, I could hear you.
Ms. Adams. Okay.
Mr. Habash. This is Matt, from Columbus, Ohio, the Mid-Ohio
Food Bank. We are taking in all the product, and we didn't have
any contractor that was willing to deliver to the 18 sites. We
have nine Appalachian counties that we serve, as well as
Columbus, and they were unwilling to do that, to say we could
have said no means people don't get food. Nobody is paying us,
with the exception of what was mentioned. Wiers Farms up in
northern Ohio was paying us a dollar a box. That is the only
vendor who has agreed to pay any money in our program so far.
Ms. Adams. Okay. So, based on the recent rise in cases of
COVID, how many pounds of food do you anticipate distributing
in the coming months?
Mr. Habash. Well, we normally do about 75 million pounds a
year, and that was already up from about 63 million the year
before, and we are anticipating probably closing in on 100
million pounds of food, if we can find the food. It is just
that demand is up 30 percent.
Ms. Adams. Okay. Was the food that you received from the
program from a national, regional, or local producer, and do
you think that this impacted your experience with the program?
Mr. Habash. Well, Eric, do you want to go ahead and chime
in, or do you want to----
Mr. Cooper. Yes. I think the challenges with the program is
it is just not providing enough volume, and many families are
going away hungry, if you will, because the supply is not
meeting the demand. And then the challenges around the
logistics and the expenses associated, the thought that food
banks have the power to negotiate, it really is powerless, you
either accept the food or you don't, the contractor's going to
move that product to some other community, and you would miss
out. And so we need the food. Ultimately, the line of families
need nourishment, and we are, in a way, we will take the food
and--raise to cover the expenses if we have to.
Ms. Adams. Very--thank you very much, and thank you very
much for being here. I yield back, Madam Chair.
The Chair. Thank you so much. Ranking Member Conaway, you
are recognized for----
Mr. Conaway. Thank you, Madam Chair. Eric, the dramatic
photograph from early April of cars lined up at your facility,
has that happened every single day?
Mr. Cooper. We have about 20 of those distributions a week.
Now, that photograph was at the largest distribution, which
occurred at the onset of the crisis, where 10,000 families came
to get food. Our average distributions are about----
Mr. Conaway. But you pass out food every day at that site?
Mr. Cooper. No. We rotate throughout south Texas at
multiple sites.
Mr. Conaway. All right. I have a note here from Libby
Campbell, one of your cohorts, that I have the pleasure of
representing. She got 1,200 boxes yesterday of cheese, butter,
produce, and cream, and it is all out in the hands of consumers
in less than 24 hours, so I need to brag on Libby and her team
over in Midland and Odessa for making that happen.
Fellows, both of your testimony is almost exactly the same
thing. Did Feeding America give you that testimony?
Mr. Cooper. Absolutely, we are all connected with Libby,
she is a great.
Mr. Conaway. Okay. Eric, yes, I have a limited amount of
time, Eric, I am going to be a little abrupt. I apologize for
that. Are you free to disagree with that testimony?
Mr. Cooper. Absolutely.
Mr. Conaway. Did your board, did they go through with you
and adopt that, or is that--you and Matt put that out on behalf
of San Antonio-Ohio?
Mr. Cooper. Yes.
Mr. Habash. Go ahead, Eric.
Mr. Cooper. Our board supports us in that, and, again,
congratulations on working with Libby. I know last time we were
together, Congressman, it was in Midland, and I know that was
the first truckload of CFAP boxes that they received there in
that community.
Mr. Conaway. Well, thanks----
Mr. Habash. Congressman?
Mr. Conaway. Yes, Matt?
Mr. Habash. This is Matt, and my testimony is my own. It
was not written by Feeding America. It is what we experienced
here in central and eastern Ohio.
Mr. Conaway. Yes, Matt. The recommendations, though, appear
almost word for word with Eric's, so I don't know where either
one of you got it, but it came off of Feeding America, which is
fine, in that regard. But, do you guys pay fees to Feeding
America to belong to their organization?
Mr. Cooper. They actually support us with food and funds
across the United States. The network works very, very well
together to make sure that----
Mr. Conaway. But you don't pay Feeding America an annual
fee?
Mr. Cooper. I mean, we have some dues that we pay, but not
in any comparison to the support that we get.
Mr. Conaway. Yes. Well, I thank you guys. I appreciate that
with the limited amount of time. The Chair made some
interesting comments about being anxious about the potential
waste in this food program. I would hope that the other side
would be just as indignant in the waste in the food stamp
program, because they tolerate a $37 error rate in the over and
under payments as if that doesn't happen at all, and billions
are lost in these improper payments, and I don't hear the same
kind of righteous indignation associated with those error rates
as the potential, or alleged, errors within this program. With
that, I yield back.
The Chair. I am concerned about every error in every
program. Mrs. Hayes, you are recognized for 3 minutes.
Mrs. Hayes. Thank you. Mr. Cooper or Mr. Habash, I heard
your concerns about the fact that some of your producers were
not local, and didn't really know the area that they were
expected to provide products for. Had you created the
application process for the Farmers to Families Food Box, is
there anything that you would have done differently that would
have helped to improve your experience?
Mr. Cooper. Yes, I will go first, Eric from San Antonio. It
is really a coordinated distribution plan. I know, Congressman
Conaway, maybe we are similar food banks, and part of the same
network, but we represent diverse parts of the country, and a
diverse network of nonprofit organizations. Again, for us in
San Antonio, over 500 different organizations that are feeding
the 120,000 people each week. And coordinating those families
to make sure that, one, they can be at the distribution, the
amount of time it takes, the food safety aspects to keep the
product under refrigeration, having the right equipment, and
just making sure that families are fed in an equitable way,
that you don't have families showing up and walking away
without anything, that takes planning and logistics.
I think a little more effort in the coordination of that
distribution plan to make sure that there is not duplication,
nonprofits running into each other, organizations taking more
food than they know--many of the contractors only would ship a
full truckload, so some of these churches were overwhelmed with
the sheer volume, and many Feeding America food banks were
having to go and rescue that food, pick it up at the
distribution site, to take it back to their warehouse to get
the product under cold storage. That is where waste occurs,
that is where food safety is compromised, and that is what I
would do to strengthen some of the aspects of the program.
Mrs. Hayes. Did you hear from local farmers about their
involvement in being part of the production line?
Mr. Habash. This is Matt----
Mr. Cooper. Many of our local farmers throughout the Winter
Garden in southwest Texas were frustrated just because they
didn't feel like they were a part of the program. Some local
cooperatives put in bids, but were not awarded.
Mr. Habash. We had a similar experience here in Columbus,
where we had very--none of our local contractors got any bids,
and so we had to depend on vendors willing to drive much larger
distances to get any food at all in the beginning. The other
suggestion--we organized ourselves through the Ohio Association
of Food Banks to work on this program collectively for all
small food banks, and you have Feeding America, with 200 food
banks across the country, and thousands and thousands of
agencies that are all doing this every day, so that system
works really well in this country.
Mrs. Hayes. Thank you. My time has expired, but I just have
one last question, if you could just say yes or no? Connecticut
received boxes as part of this program, but everyone I have
talked to says that the best way for government to keep
families fed is to bolster the SNAP Program by 15 percent. Do
you agree?
Mr. Cooper. Yes.
Mrs. Hayes. Thank you.
Mr. Habash. Absolutely.
Mrs. Hayes. I yield back. Thank you.
The Chair. Thank you. Mr. Bacon, you are recognized for 3
minutes.
Mr. Bacon. Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Cooper, would you
say the Farm to Table Program is doing a good job alleviating
hunger in your area?
Mr. Cooper. Yes. It is a fabulous program to be able to get
the type of dairy, protein, and produce to families.
Mr. Bacon. Would you like more of it?
Mr. Cooper. Absolutely. It is not meeting the demand that
we see in our lines.
Mr. Bacon. Mr. Cooper, same questions. Is it alleviating
hunger, and would you like more of it?
Mr. Habash. You mean Matt?
Mr. Bacon. Or Mr. Habash, sorry. My fault.
Mr. Habash. Thank you, Congressman. Yes, the answer is yes.
I mean, without a doubt, we need the food stamp program, and we
need additional food, people that don't qualify for food stamps
that are asking for help, so what are we supposed to do? We
need the food. The answer is yes, we can use it. We are big
into food as help as a strategy. This program helps do that.
Mr. Bacon. There were some comments that some of the food
comes in a little old. Would you say that a lot of the food,
though, was more fresh than maybe you get at the grocery store,
being that it is coming straight from the farmer? I will ask
you both. Thank you.
Mr. Cooper. Yes. I think mostly the same quality. It is
just it was super convenient to have the produce packed in the
boxes, but not all contractor's were equal. Some of those
boxes, they weren't packed very full, and so, once they were
stacked on top of each other, the boxes would crush, the
produce would get crushed, the pallets would turn over in the
truck that was delivering it to us. They would be all falling
over. And so just some consistencies and tightening up some of
those processes could really improve the program, and we hope
that USDA would consider having the contractors do that.
Mr. Bacon. I have no doubt there could be ways to tighten
the program. I used to live on a farm until I joined the Air
Force, and I can tell you, there is nothing better than fresh
tomatoes, and sweet corn, and so forth. But one last question,
what would you say is the percentage of the produce that you
get is actually given to people in need? Is it 90 percent, 95
percent, 98? What would you say? Just trying to get a rough--
because, to me, that is a good gauge of success.
Mr. Cooper. One hundred percent of the produce that we are
receiving is going to families.
Mr. Habash. I would say the same thing, Congressman. If it
has come directly from a farm, it is absolutely 100 percent of
the food. If it comes from a retail outlet that has leftovers
that are pulling off the shelves, then you have a little bit
of--basically shrink--that isn't going to be usable. But, come
straight from the farms, we love product directly from the
farms. It is in and out of our door in 24 hours.
Mr. Bacon. That is good, because what I am hearing is there
is not much being thrown out in that situation. What I am
hearing is you are giving out about 100 percent of the produce,
it is helping alleviate hunger, and you would like more. I
appreciate your great feedback, and I yield back, Madam Chair.
Thank you.
The Chair. Thank you. Mr. Panetta, you are recognized for 3
minutes.
Mr. Panetta. Thank you, Madam Chair. I appreciate this
opportunity. Gentlemen, thank you for your service, and I
apologize for you not being here in front of us, but know you
are doing a lot better job, and a lot more to the people that
you serve than being here. I appreciate you being there, so
thank you very much.
Quickly, I know one of you mentioned the National Guard,
and the benefits that they are providing there. Can you go into
that a little bit more?
Mr. Habash. Sure. We, very early, in Ohio asked our
governor for National Guard support, so this is early March. We
were lucky, as the State Association of Food Banks told us--
made a direct request for all of us. I asked for 100 National
Guards-people. They have been here since the later part of
March. They are scheduled to expire on August the 7th, then
they have 2 weeks of furlough, the money has run out. We could
not get volunteers. I have 754 volunteer slots a week to fill.
They have filled those, they have delivered meals to seniors,
they have stepped in and packed 27,000 emergency boxes. They
have delivered these CFAP boxes. They are running our pantry,
which went from 100 families a day to 700 families a day
because of this. They have been a godsend to us, and we would
love to keep them, because right now--well, you have to
remember it is not all senior citizens for volunteers, some it
is corporate, and there are corporations that are not willing
to come back, particularly when the pandemic is rising here in
Ohio.
Mr. Panetta. Understood.
Mr. Cooper. Yes, we too have gotten National Guard, and
would not be able to maintain as many distributions as we are
doing without them. Just because of the spike of cases, a lot
of our volunteers are seniors, so it has been an incredible
backbone of strength to get these food boxes to families.
Mr. Panetta. Good, and that is exactly what I see out on
the Central Coast of California, every week I go out to food
distribution sites, and let me tell you, going to the sites
that have the National Guard make it a little bit easier, a
little smoother, and let me tell you, the people that work for
the food banks are very thankful for their participation, so we
will hopefully continue to work our governor to make sure that
they stay there in California as well.
Talk to me about the percentage of new recipients you are
seeing come to your food banks. I know in my area it is about
40 percent new recipients from the COVID pandemic. What are you
guys seeing?
Mr. Cooper. Because of our significant hospitality industry
in San Antonio, about 50 percent of who were receiving were
first time recipients of our food bank, and it caused us to
really partner with hotels, restaurant associations to do some
outreach to connect to their furloughed workers. But it is
about 50 percent.
Mr. Habash. Our is a little lower than that, but we can
tell you exactly that, as of today, 27,430 new families have
shown up that have never asked for help. We have a data
tracking system that goes back 10 years. These are new families
to our system that have never asked for help ever before.
Mr. Panetta. Okay. Let me just ask this real quick question
before my time runs out. In your opinion, what Federal food
program has the most impact on people receiving these types of
benefits, in your opinion?
Mr. Cooper. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,
SNAP, is the first line of defense, and really is super
efficient, because it capitalizes on the existing
infrastructure of grocery stores in rural communities and
urban, and that is what can strengthen households' nutrition.
Mr. Habash. Congressman, we have said here that we are not
going to food bank our way out of hunger. At the end of the
day, the SNAP Program is the number one. And then, as you look
at who else doesn't qualify for SNAP because their income is
above that, food banks are--and the pantries that we have are
the only line of defense for them as well.
Mr. Panetta. I appreciate that, I appreciate your service.
I yield back. Thank you, Madam Chair.
The Chair. Thank you. Ranking Member Conaway, in the
absence of Mr. Johnson, do you wish to make any closing
comments?
Mr. Conaway. No, ma'am. I am good to go. Thank you.
The Chair. All right. As we close, let me just ask one
question to you both. Did you say anything today that was not
accurate? To the best of your knowledge?
Mr. Cooper. No.
Mr. Habash. No.
The Chair. So, no matter who wrote it, it was accurate?
Mr. Habash. I guarantee we wrote it, for starters, but the
second point is, yes, everything we have said is accurate. I
was trying not to use any anecdotal information from anybody,
only direct things that we knew from ourselves and the
testimony.
The Chair. Thank you very much. As we prepare to adjourn,
let me just say that under the Rules of the Committee, the
record of today's hearing will remain open for 10 calendar days
to receive additional material and supplementary written
responses from the witnesses to any question posed by a Member.
This hearing of the Subcommittee on Nutrition, Oversight, and
Department Operations is adjourned, and thank you all so much
for being here today.
Mr. Cooper. Thank you.

Submitted Letters and Articles by Hon. James P. McGovern, a
Representative in Congress from Massachusetts; on Behalf of Hon. Lloyd
Doggett, a Representative in Congress from Texas
Letter 1
May 26, 2020

Hon. Sonny Perdue,
Secretary,
U.S. Department of Agriculture
Washington, D.C. 20250

Dear Secretary Perdue:

I write to express my strong objection to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's (USDA) decision to award Farmers to Families Food Box
Program distribution contracts to entities lacking the operational
capability to receive, store, and distribute requested food for
families struggling with food insecurity.
I am specifically requesting that you immediately issue a stop work
order for CRE8AD8 in San Antonio, as you have reportedly already done
with California Avocados Direct, and that thereafter you promptly
cancel this contract. This contract was issued without a credible
background check with a company not licensed to perform and with no
work history indicating a capacity to perform at a time of urgent
public need for competent delivery. CRE8AD8 was given until June 30 to
complete distribution of the 750,000 boxes in a seven-state region, but
to date it has apparently failed to distribute a single box.
Images from San Antonio brought national attention to the record
number of families facing food insecurity as a result of the economic
fallout of the ongoing pandemic. Those with children represent some of
the most impacted--recent reports show two in five households with
children 12 and under are food-insecure. At a time when families need
help the most, USDA should be prioritizing funding for experienced
contractors with established community relationships to ensure there
are no unnecessary delays to much needed support. A family cannot eat
an IOU. Poor performing, inexperienced contractors risk delaying food
delivery or even delivering spoiled dangerous food to families who need
help now.
USDA awarding 198 contracts in a week involved a process which
failed to protect taxpayers, the hungry, and producers with food going
to waste. In addition to seeking prompt answers to all of the questions
raised by House Agriculture Subcommittee Chairs Rep. Stacey Plaskett,
Rep. Jim Costa, and Rep. Marcia Fudge in their May 22 letter expressing
similar concerns, I seek your responses to the following in order to
determine how you are assuring that flaws with other companies do not
create similar problems:

1.  How did USDA ensure awardees had established relationships with
other supply chain subcontractors needed to execute the
Farmers to Families Food Box Program? Describe in full the
background check done for each awardee and provide the
specific results of your background check on CRE8AD8.

2.  Prior to awarding contracts, what specific steps, if any, did
USDA take to ensure awardees had secured facilities to
protect food safety, including refrigerated transportation
and storage?

3.  What is USDA doing now to ensure food safety during the contract
period?

4.  What actions has USDA taken for awardees who are not fulfilling
contractual obligations?

5.  Which Farmers to Families Food Box Program distribution contracts
have already been terminated?

6.  Under the contract awarded to CRE8AD8, was there a daily and
weekly distribution requirement to ensure families are not
waiting on food throughout the approximately 6 week
contract period?

7.  What steps have already been undertaken, if any, to ensure that
families receive the food that CRE8AD8 has been unable to
deliver since the program's distribution period began May
15?

For the sake of those Texans who through no fault of their own rely
on these meals, I look forward to your prompt action on this important
matter.
Sincerely,

Hon. Lloyd Doggett.
Letter 2
June 10, 2020

Hon. Sonny Perdue,
Secretary,
U.S. Department of Agriculture
Washington, D.C. 20250

Dear Secretary Perdue:

In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, so many Texas families
continue to rely on food banks for meals. I write regarding your
unexplained failure to respond to my urgent May 26 inquiry concerning
the Farmers to Families Food Box Program and the contract awarded to
unqualified and unprepared San Antonio-based company, CRE8AD8. Despite
repeated comments by your Congressional Relations office that you are
``prioritizing a response,'' I have not received one.
I have enclosed a San Antonio Express-News report for your review.
As of Saturday, June 6, only the San Antonio Food Bank had received
shipments from CRE8AD8 within the seven-state contract area that
includes Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Utah
as well as Texas. Other food banks in the Southwest Region have not
received any of the 469 total truckloads they desperately need,
including the Central Texas Food Bank in Austin, whose inquiries to
CRE8AD8 were ignored.
This contract requires delivering 750,000 boxes by the end of this
month. Recent reporting of delays and mismanagement indicate that this
will not come close to being achieved. As I requested previously, you
should immediately issue a stop work order, cancel the contract, and
instead ensure that hungry families get the food they need. For the
sake of those Texans who through no fault of their own rely on these
meals, I look forward to your immediate action and response to my
specific questions about the mismanagement of this matter by USDA.
Sincerely,

Hon. Lloyd Doggett.

Food banks in other cities, states disappointed by San Antonio's
CRE8AD8 lack of performance
Tom Orsborn (https://www.expressnews.com/author/tom-orsborn/) June 7,
2020 Updated: June 7, 2020 11:42 a.m.

Food bank administrators in Texas and surrounding states are
baffled by the lack of communication and food boxes from a San Antonio
events planning company that landed a $39 million Federal contract to
provide food relief.
While many U.S. Department of Agriculture contractors in the
agency's Farmers to Families Food Box Program began making shipments
shortly after the start of the distribution period on May 15, the first
delivery from Gregorio Palomino's CRE8AD8--pronounced ``create a
date''--didn't come until May 28.
After the completion of that first delivery--235 boxes out of a
total of 750,000 required under the contract--Palomino posted on his
personal Facebook page that ``tens of thousands'' of food boxes would
be ``landing next week throughout TX, UT, AZ, OK, LA, AR & NM!''
It didn't happen.
``They were supposed to ramp up right away, and here we are almost
3 weeks after the start time and we've got nothing,'' said Tom Kertis,
President and CEO of St. Mary's Food Bank in Phoenix. ``All this money
was poured into one provider, and they are not delivering.''
``In the meantime, people aren't getting food because (CRE8AD8)
wasn't prepared.''
As of Saturday, only the San Antonio Food Bank had received
shipments from CRE8AD8, which has until June 30 to deliver all 750,000
food boxes within a seven-state area that includes Arizona, Arkansas,
Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Utah as well as Texas.
Through Saturday, the San Antonio Food Bank has received 4,121
total boxes: 2,747 filled with fruits and vegetables from San Antonio's
Avila Produce and 1,374 containing precooked chicken from Gourmet Foods
of Rancho Dominguez, Calif., according to bills of lading.
Of the 469 truckloads of food CRE8AD8 is contracted to deliver in
the seven-state region, the San Antonio Food Bank is scheduled to
receive 57. The boxes typically weigh between 17 and 25 pounds each.

San Antonio Food Bank employee Victor Mariscal unloads
pallets of produce boxes delivered by Avila Produce, Friday,
June 5, 2020. The delivery is part of CRE8AD8's $39 million
Federal contract to deliver 750,000 boxes of produce, dairy and
protein by the end of June to a seven-state area. Friday's
shipment brought the total to 4,121 boxes delivered to the food
bank so far; no boxes have been sent to food banks in other
cities yet.

The Food Bank is scheduled to receive more boxes of protein from
CRE8AD8 next week.
``We are 3 weeks into the 6 week program and we have received 3\1/
2\ truckloads of the 57 we hope to use to feed our families,'' said
Eric Cooper, President and CEO of the Food Bank. ``I guess we are lucky
to have received the 3\1/2\ as the other food banks in the Southwest
Region have not received any of the 469 they desperately need.''
Palomino, who has boasted of heading ``an internationally
recognized'' business ``with a global footprint,'' did not respond to
requests for comment.
Lauren Lear, identified as CRE8AD8's ``dispatch manager'' on a bill
of lading, also declined interview requests.

Robokowski, the San Antonio Food Bank produce procurement
manager, after delivering several pallets of produce boxes at

Palomino traveled to California last week to broker deals with food
purveyors. CRE8AD8's credit payment terms have ranged from 30 to 60
days, said purveyors in Texas who had preliminary negotiations with the
company but declined to go forward because they didn't want to extend
credit to an inexperienced company and other reasons.
``Many of these people want everything up-front,'' Palomino wrote
in an email to a consultant in Arizona who shared it with the Express-
News. ``I'm not against it, but people think that we just have money in
the bank like that.''
The USDA required that bidders show proof of ``adequate financial
resources to perform the contract or the ability to obtain them.'' A
USDA spokesperson said contractors are paid ``upon the submission and
approval of an invoice evidencing delivery.''
The Federal agency handed out nearly 200 contracts worth $1.2
billion for the food box program, which calls for contractors to buy up
surplus food from farmers and ranchers, pack it into boxes and deliver
it to food banks and other nonprofits to assist people reeling from the
COVID-19-triggered recession.
CRE8AD8 won the contract despite having no experience in food
distribution and lacking a Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act
(PACA) license, which the USDA likens to a driver's license for
operating a produce business.
CRE8AD8 has since acquired a PACA license, receiving it just days
after it submitted an application. The process usually takes weeks to
complete, industry veterans said.

A box of produce filled with white onions, oranges, zucchini
and other vegetables and fruits is part of a shipment of
produce delivered by Avila Produce to the San Antonio Food Bank
on Friday, June 5, 2020. The delivery is part of San Antonio
CRE8AD8's $39 million USDA contract to deliver 750,000 boxes of
produce and protein by the end of June to a seven-state area as
part of a new food relief program.

With CRE8AD8 lacking contacts within the food bank industry, Cooper
helped the company develop a distribution schedule. On May 15, he
presented CRE8AD8 with a plan calling for deliveries to 23 food banks
in Texas, Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Utah.
``The USDA is bringing these non-industry partners to the table,
and we are having to help them with the learning curve,'' Cooper said.
Cooper's plan included the number of truckloads for each food bank;
the number of boxes in each of the produce, protein and dairy
categories; addresses and contact information for food bank employees.
After receiving input from CRE8AD8, the plan was revised ``several
times'' before it was ``finalized'' May 27, Cooper said. The revisions
centered on overcoming logistical challenges, mainly involving what is
known in the food bank industry as ``last-mile issues,'' Cooper said.
``They were supposed to then reach out to the (food banks) and
coordinate the deliveries,'' Cooper said of CRE8AD8.
But food bank administrators throughout the seven-state region that
should be served by CRE8AD8 said they have not heard from the company.
``I've moved on and I am working with those vendors who are
communicating with me,'' said Denise Blok, chief operating officer of
the Central Texas Food Bank in Austin, which is supposed to receive
three truckloads from CRE8AD8.
Blok said she called CRE8AD8 shortly after the USDA announced May 8
it had given the company the contract.
``Nobody has ever gotten in touch with us,'' Blok said ``There is
frustration, especially because it is someone that is (geographically)
close to us. To not hear from a single person from the company, that is
a little discouraging.''

Trisha Cunningham, President and CEO of the North Dallas Food Bank
in Plano, described a similarly frustrating experience with CRE8AD8.
The North Dallas Food Bank should receive nine truckloads from CRE8AD8.
``The (North Dallas Food Bank) has requested food from the company,
but to date, we have not received any product,'' Cunningham said. ``We
are hopeful they will be able to deliver on the requested product so we
can use this food to feed our community.''
St. Mary's Food Bank in Phoenix was told it would receive 24
truckloads from CRE8AD8. In need of protein boxes, Kertis said he
reached out to Gourmet Foods to see if CRE8AD8 could provide it with
boxes of precooked chicken.
Gourmet Foods' reply left Kertis crestfallen.
``I was told they are going to focus on Texas, and they might
schedule a load for (delivery to Phoenix) at the end of the month,''
Kertis said. ``The program ends at the end of the month, so in effect
we have virtually no meat items.''
Kertis said he's puzzled as to why CRE8AD8 is focused on delivering
so many boxes of chicken and pork to Texas when it would be cheaper to
ship to Phoenix.

``They are coming out of L.A., and it's about a 6 to 7 hour drive
out of L.A.,'' he said. ``The cost would be lower, and they would
spread the wealth around a little bit. But it doesn't sound like they
want to do it. It's unfortunate.''
Eric Kopelow, chief operating officer for Gourmet Foods, said the
company's ``first obligation is to the San Antonio Food Bank,''
according to its agreement with CRE8AD8.``Phoenix is a secondary
location,'' Kopelow said.

Letter 3
June 15, 2020

Hon. Lloyd Doggett,
U.S. House of Representatives,
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Congressman Doggett:

Thank you for your letter of May 26 and June 10, 2020, with
questions about the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Farmers to
Families Food Box Program (FFFBP). The following is background about
the program and answers to your specific questions.
FFFBP is a new, innovative program designed to provide critical
support to American farmers and families in response to the COVID-19
pandemic. To address the immediate food needs of newly unemployed
Americans and respond to the crisis of food rotting in fields and
animals being euthanized, USDA moved expeditiously to stand up the
program and begin new pipelines of support to communities across the
nation.
The goal of FFFBP is to allow producers to sell food previously
destined for restaurants and other bulk purchasers to suppliers--
preventing waste--while helping Americans in need during the COVID-19
pandemic. The program is designed to put American farmers and
distributors of all sizes back to work while supporting burdened food
banks, community and faith-based organizations, as well as other
nonprofits serving Americans in need. USDA prioritized working with
impacted organizations of all sizes and across all regions of the
United States to ensure maximum positive impact of the program.
USDA is committed to ensuring the integrity of the program and
administrating it in an efficient and cost-effective way. Outlined
below is information about the structure of the purchase program and
the safeguards put in place to protect taxpayers' funds and ensure that
relevant laws and regulations are being followed.
Utilizing contracting flexibilities provided by Federal Acquisition
Regulation (FAR) Part 18 during an emergency declaration, USDA designed
a process to rapidly vet and approve contractors to participate in the
program. The vetting process relied on answers to a Request for
Proposals. Offerors described the capabilities they had for achieving
performance under the contract.
Demonstrations of this capability included, but were not limited
to, commercial experience; business ethics and integrity standards;
food safety and/or regulatory audits; inspections, certifications and
approvals; and a demonstration of financial capability to perform.
USDA evaluated the offeror's ability to responsibly execute the
requirements of the contract as they pertain to administrative,
ethical, safety, compliance, and financial prowess of the offeror. As
part of USDA's standard internal controls, the acquisition will be
reviewed for compliance to the solicitation and Federal regulations.
In addition, the Contracting Officer is monitoring the performance
of the contractors. If there are concerns, contractual remedies may be
used, which could include termination. USDA has chosen to exercise this
right in at least two situations and will not hesitate to do so if
circumstances warrant such a response.

1.  How did USDA ensure awardees had established relationships with
other supply chain subcontractors needed to execute the
Farmers to Families Food Box Program? Describe in full the
background check done for each awardee and provide the
specific results of your background check on CRE8AD8.

Like other Federal contracts administered by USDA, the FFFBP
and its awardees require strict adherence to the FAR and
other regulations. All proposals were carefully reviewed by
a team of contracting and technical experts, and contracts
made accordingly.
Proposals for the FFFBP were evaluated by (in descending order
of importance) the technical information; past performance
of the offeror; the offeror's capability to perform; and
the prices offered. Offerors must have met all criteria in
order to be competitive and must have, or be able to
acquire, a Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA)
license to comply with the contractual requirement.
As part of the proposal, offerors, including CRE8AD8, described
their capabilities for achieving performance under the
contract. Demonstrations of this capability included, but
were not limited to, commercial experience; business ethics
and integrity standards; food safety and/or regulatory
audits, inspections, certifications and approvals; and a
demonstration of financial capability to perform.
Each awarded offeror provided three past performance references
for similar contract/orders completed within the past 3
years (or contracts and orders which were currently being
completed).
The program was dependent upon relationships between
contractors, subcontractors, nonprofit and other
governmental organizations, taking advantage of the
marketplace and natural supply chains.
An important point to make about the program is that
contractors are only paid for the food boxes they
successfully deliver. Each offeror provided an estimate of
how many boxes they could assemble and deliver. If the
entity falls behind in the volume promised, USDA
contracting staff have the ability to take appropriate
action.

2.  Prior to awarding contracts, what specific steps, if any, did
USDA take to ensure awardees had secured facilities to
protect food safety, including refrigerated transportation
and storage?

The prime contractor receiving an award is responsible for all
aspects of contract performance. The aspects of performance
include, but are not limited to, sourcing product for
inclusion in boxes; conducting all aspects of preparing the
boxes; sourcing and communicating with nonprofits; and
transporting and delivering of boxes to the nonprofit on a
mutually agreeable, recurring schedule. It was anticipated
that a number of firms would need to subcontract some
element of their plan, including supply, handling or
delivery. Please see answers to Question 3 for additional
information about oversight.

3.  What is USDA doing now to ensure food safety during the contract
period?

As previously mentioned, as part of the proposal, offerors
described their capabilities for achieving performance
under the contract. Demonstrations of this capability
included, but were not limited to, commercial experience;
business ethics and integrity standards; food safety and/or
regulatory audits, inspections, certifications and
approvals; and a demonstration of financial capability to
perform.
Ensuring that the food for the FFFBP is handled in a safe
manner is critical to the success of the program. USDA will
provide oversight throughout the contract period,
conducting audits to ensure food safety plans are followed,
contract terms are fulfilled, and only quality domestic
produce is provided and delivered to nonprofits and
governmental agencies in support of Americans in need.
There are multiple actions available to the Contracting
Officer for non-conformance, including contract
termination.

4.  What actions has USDA taken for awardees who are not fulfilling
contractual obligations?

A key performance indicator in which contractors will be
measured is successful delivery of quality food boxes. If
contractors are not meeting their commitments, the
contracting staff has the ability to adjust the contract
accordingly, including termination of the contract.

5.  Which Farmers to Families Food Box Program distribution contracts
have already been terminated?

USDA has terminated two contracts to date. The contracts were
with Ben Holtz Consulting and Fossil Creek Farms.

6.  Under the contract awarded to CRE8AD8, was there a daily and
weekly distribution requirement to ensure families are not
waiting on food throughout the approximately 6 week
contract period?

There were no daily or weekly contractual requirements for
delivery; however, the contractor is required to deliver
the product within the 6 week delivery period. The
expectation is that the contractor will work with the
recipients to ensure deliveries are made on a mutually
agreeable schedule. If contractors do not meet promised
delivery schedules, contracting staff have remedies
available, including contract termination.

7.  What steps have already been undertaken, if any, to ensure that
families receive the food that CRE8AD8 has been unable to
deliver since the program's distribution period began May
15?

It is important to note that more than 1.126 million boxes have
been delivered to various parts of Texas as of June 1,
2020. However, as USDA looks ahead to the end of the
initial round of the FFFBP contracts worth $1.2 billion on
June 30, 2020, USDA is exploring options to continue
serving American farmers and families up to the program's
$3 billion authorization. USDA may extend current contracts
or award additional contracts to ensure that under-served
areas are provided an opportunity to participate in the
program. Some contracts may not be extended based on vendor
performance.

Initial program feedback has been incredibly positive. USDA is
committed to the program's success and is optimistic it will have
meaningful impact for the many customers it serves. I look forward to
keeping you and your Congressional colleagues updated on its
contributions.
If you have any further questions, please have a member of your
staff contact the Office of Congressional Relations and
Intergovernmental Affairs at [Redacted].
Sincerely,

Hon. Sonny Perdue,
Secretary.

Editorial: Investigate USDA food box contracts
Express-News Editorial Board May 18, 2020

Gregorio Palomino, CEO of CRE8AD8, received a $39 million
Federal contract to create and distribute food boxes to food
banks and nonprofits--but failed to deliver. A reader wonders
how much of that contract he received.

Although it has just begun, the USDA's Farmers to Families Food Box
Program is off to a disturbing start, one that appears to be a betrayal
of taxpayers and unlikely to deliver for Americans in need.
Many questions have been raised about the contracts the U.S.
Department of Agriculture has awarded to companies to package and
distribute produce, dairy and meat to food banks across the nation.
Questions that are, unfortunately, best reflected in the awarding of a
$39.1 million contract to a San Antonio-based event planning company,
CRE8AD8 LLC (pronounced Create a date).
Has CRE8AD8 ever distributed wholesale food to food banks and
nonprofits? No, owner Gregorio Palomino told Express-News reporter Tom
Orsborn.
Does CRE8AD8 have a Perishable Agricultural Commodities ACT, or
PACA, license?
``It's been applied for,'' Palomino said.
Can CRE8AD8 hit the ground running, getting food boxes to families
in need as quickly as possible?
Nope. Palomino is scrambling to hire people, and hopes to be up and
running in June.
Does CRE8AD8 have the warehouse and logistics operations to supply
the massive Southwestern Region, which stretches across Texas,
Arkansas, Arizona, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Utah.
We don't think so.
``We knew that we easily could do this because instead of putting
tchotchkes in a bag that is going to go to a conference attendee, this
is the same exact thing except it's just food going into a box,''
Palomino said.
In principle, the Farmers to Families Food Box Program is a worthy
idea. With the closure of restaurants and schools during the pandemic,
the program purchases surplus dairy, meat and produce. The idea is to
package this food into family-sized boxes and then distribute it to
food banks. So, why not contract with known food distributors instead
of doling out millions to an event planner?
Other questionable awards in the $1.2 billion program include
contracts for two meat processors under investigation and a bankrupt
dairy producer. A number of contracts went to companies outside the
regions they are supposed to serve.
It's almost as if USDA doesn't care if the food makes it to those
in need. When an event planner secures a contract like this, it's time
for Congress to investigate.

Let's remember, the USDA should never have awarded a $39 million
contract to CRE8AD8, a San Antonio event planner we wouldn't entrust
with putting tchotchkes in a bag, let alone delivering food for
struggling families.
While it is welcome news the USDA won't renew its contract with
CRE8AD8--as in ``Create A Date''--and its assailable owner, Gregorio
Palomino, this is only a decision that prevents future harm.
It does nothing to ease the pain Palomino's abject failure has
created for families and communities across Texas and beyond.
It does nothing to explain how an event planner with no experience
in food distribution, who has misrepresented himself to the public,
would land such a large contract at such a critical moment.
What does harm look like? In this case, it looks like the number
zero, which is exactly how many food boxes CRE8AD8 delivered to the
North Texas Food Bank in Plano, and the Southeast Texas Food Bank in
Beaumont, and the West Texas Food Bank in Odessa, and the Community
Food Bank of Southern Arizona in Tucson, and the Utah Food Bank in Salt
Lake City.
``We have received zero loads, zero boxes, zero of anything'' from
CRE8AD8, Libby Campbell, executive director of the West Texas Food
Bank, told Express-News reporter Tom Orsborn.
Even in those instances when CRE8AD8 delivered something, it was
inadequate. At the San Antonio Food Bank, which has been serving
120,000 people a week in this crisis, CRE8AD8 was supposed to deliver
57 truckloads of food. It delivered an estimated 22.
Likewise, it was supposed to deliver 87 truckloads to the Houston
Food Bank, but it only came through with 15.
Every failure by CRE8AD8 had the potential to leave someone hungry.
This was a contract for 750,000 boxes of food through the USDA's deeply
flawed $3 billion Farmers to Families Food Box Program. It should have
gone to a proven supplier, and our Congressional delegation needs to
keep pressing on why it didn't.
As we have learned since the contract was awarded in May, Palomino
has brazenly misrepresented himself and his company, claiming
associations that were not true--and were easily checked.
We learned this thanks to dogged reporting from Orsborn, who in
normal times covers sports, but in this moment of crisis has chronicled
food insecurity. Stories like these are why local news matters.
Bigger picture, we can't help but wonder if the Farmers to Families
Food Box Program is really the best approach to feeding the hungry.
With schools and restaurants closing during this pandemic, the program
purchases surplus dairy, meat and produce. These items are packaged
into family-size boxes and then distributed to food banks.
While that sounds promising, it has opened the door to questionable
contracts. Besides, if the primary goal is to feed the hungry and ease
overburdened food banks, it would make more sense to funnel these funds
to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, providing direct
support to families and allowing them to shop at grocery stores rather
than wait in distribution lines.
We're relieved CRE8AD8's contract wasn't renewed. But if feeding
families is the priority, how on earth did Palomino land this contract?

Submitted Letters by Hon. Abigail Davis Spanberger, a Representative in
Congress from Virginia
letter 1
June 15, 2020

Hon. Sonny Perdue,
Secretary,
United States Department of Agriculture
Washington, D.C.

Dear Secretary Perdue,

We write today to express our grave concerns about the distribution
of contracts under the Farmers to Families Food Box Program. While we
sincerely appreciate USDA's efforts to quickly provide relief to
farmers and those without adequate access to food through the creation
of the program, we are concerned that the Commonwealth of Virginia has
received a disproportionately small share of food through this program
under the contracts awarded to date.
Under contracts awarded by the program, it is our understanding
that the Feeding America food bank network in Virginia is only expected
to receive 2.3 million pounds of food relief. This quantity is far less
than the amount that would be allocated if the program were
administered under the same formula utilized by The Emergency Food
Assistance Program (TEFAP), which distributes food relief proportional
to each state's needs. Had aid been allocated under the TEFAP formula,
we would expect Virginia to receive approximately 5.3 million pounds
out of the 264 million pounds of product distributed in the first
contract period.
We are also deeply concerned that only one food distributor in the
state, DeLune Corp, was awarded a contract through the program in the
first round of approvals. While we are grateful for the speed with
which the first round of awards was distributed, we are concerned that
Virginia is currently under-serviced by participating distributors.
Food banks across Virginia have reported difficulty receiving aid
through the program, especially in our rural communities, even as
demand for food assistance continues to rise alongside growing
unemployment, economic uncertainty, and the ongoing public health
crisis.
Given these concerns, we ask that you provide answers to the
following questions:

1.  1. What formula did USDA use to decide how to allocate food under
the Farmers to Families Food Box Program? Why did USDA
choose not to utilize the existing need-based method used
by the TEFAP Program?

2.  In awarding the first round of contracts, what steps, if any, did
USDA take to ensure that all geographic areas were
serviced? Will USDA commit that when awarding future rounds
of contracts, steps are taken to ensure that all geographic
regions are served by the program and receive aid
proportional to the region's need?

3.  Before the first round of contracts, did USDA conduct any
outreach to individual food banks or food bank networks to
assess their needs, level of increased demand, or any other
concerns they might have about the program's
administration? Will USDA commit to conducting outreach to
food banks to assess their needs ahead of any future rounds
of funding?

We are truly grateful for the USDA's swift actions to set up the
Farmers to Families Food Box Program. Like many regions, Virginia has
seen dramatic increases in the number of those suffering from food
insecurity. We believe that the Farmers to Families Food Box Program
can be an essential lifeline for those who need it, and we stand ready
to help ensure that this critical relief program is administered in a
manner that is fair, equitable, and best reflects the needs of
communities across the country.
We thank you for your attention to this important matter and look
forward to your response.
Sincerely,

Hon. Abigail D. Spanberger,
Member of Congress.

Hon. Abigail Davis Spanberger,
Member,
U.S. House of Representatives,
Washington, D.C.

Dear Congresswoman Spanberger:

Thank you for your letter of June 15, 2020, cosigned by your
colleagues, with questions about the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
(USDA) Farmers to Families Food Box Program (FFFBP). Provided below is
background information about the program and answers to your specific
questions.
FFFBP is a new, innovative program designed to provide critical
support to American farmers and families in response to the COVID-19
pandemic. To address the immediate food needs of newly unemployed
Americans and respond to the crisis of food rotting in fields and
animals being euthanized, USDA moved expeditiously to stand up the
program and begin new pipelines of support to communities across the
Nation.
The goal of FFFBP is to allow producers to sell food previously
destined for restaurants and other bulk purchasers to suppliers-
preventing waste-while helping Americans in need during the COVID-19
pandemic. The program is designed to put American farmers and
distributors of all sizes back to work while supporting burdened food
banks, community and faith-based organizations, as well as other non-
profits serving Americans in need. USDA prioritized working with
impacted organizations of all sizes and across all regions of the
United States to ensure maximum positive impact of the program.
Utilizing contracting flexibilities provided by Federal Acquisition
Regulation (FAR) Part 18 during an emergency declaration, USDA designed
a process to rapidly vet and approve contractors to participate in the
program. The vetting process relied on answers to a Request for
Proposals. Offerors described the capabilities they had for achieving
performance under the contract.
Demonstrations of this capability included, but were not limited
to, commercial experience; business ethics and integrity standards;
food safety and/or regulatory audits; inspections, certifications and
approvals; and a demonstration of financial capability to perform.
USDA evaluated the offeror's ability to responsibly execute the
requirements of the contract as they pertain to administrative,
ethical, safety, compliance, and financial prowess of the offeror. As
part of USDA's standard internal controls, the acquisition will be
reviewed for compliance to the solicitation and Federal regulations.
An important point to make about the program is that contractors
are only paid for the food boxes they successfully deliver. Each
offeror provided an estimate of how many boxes they could assemble and
deliver. If the entity falls behind in the volume promised, USDA
contracting staff have the ability to take appropriate action.

1.  What formula did USDA use to decide how to allocate food under
the Farmers to Families Food Box Program? Why did USDA
choose not to utilize the existing need-based method used
by the TEFAP Program?

Proposals for the FFFBP were evaluated by (in descending order
of importance) the technical information; past performance
of the offeror; the offeror's capability to perform; and
the prices offered. Offerors must have met all criteria in
order to be competitive and must have, or be able to
acquire, a Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA)
license to comply with the contractual requirement.
As part of the proposal, offerors described their capabilities
for achieving performance under the contract.
Demonstrations of this capability included, but were not
limited to: commercial experience; business ethics and
integrity standards; food safety and/or regulatory audits,
inspections, certifications and approvals; and a
demonstration of financial capability to perform.
Each vendor awarded a contract provided three past performance
references for similar contract/orders completed within the
past 3 years (or contracts and orders which were currently
being completed). The amounts and locations awarded were
based on the offers received and the evaluation of those
offers.

2.  In awarding the first round of contracts, what steps, if any, did
USDA take to ensure that all geographic areas were
serviced? Will USDA commit that when awarding future rounds
of contracts, steps are taken to ensure that all geographic
regions are served by the program and receive aid
proportional to the region's need?

USDA is exploring options to continue serving American farmers
and families up to the program's $3 billion authorization.
USDA plans to extend current contracts and award additional
contracts to ensure that under-served areas are provided an
opportunity to participate in the program. Using emergency
procedures for under-served areas, USDA plans to issue
additional contracts by drawing on the pool of original
proposals submitted.

3.  Before the first round of contracts, did USDA conduct any
outreach to individual food banks or food bank networks to
assess their needs, level of increased demand, or any other
concerns they might have about the program's
administration? Will USDA commit to conducting outreach to
food banks to assess their needs ahead of any future rounds
of funding?

FFFBP provides a new approach to support American farmers and
families, and USDA moved as expeditiously as Federal
procurement rules allow to stand up the program and solicit
offers. While many conversations took place with nonprofit
organizations during the 3 weeks between the announcement
of the program and the award of contracts, the short
timeframe to begin much needed shipments of produce did not
allow for extensive dialogue. Nonprofit organizations will
work directly with suppliers to determine details regarding
delivery, including volume and delivery schedules.
Any entity that provides to their local supplier proof of its
501(c)(3) tax exempt status or is a government entity
(e.g., school food authority, Indian Tribe, etc.) and who
can demonstrate that they have the operational and
financial capability to receive, store, and distribute
requested food items is eligible to participate. Nonprofit
organizations can contact the supplier that has been
awarded the contract for their service area to see if they
can partner and participate in the program. The list of
suppliers that have been awarded contracts is available on
USDA's website.

Initial program feedback has been incredibly positive. USDA is
committed to the program's success and optimistic it will have
meaningful impact for the many customers it serves. I look forward to
keeping you and your Congressional colleagues updated on its
contributions.
If you have any further questions, please have a member of your
staff contact the Office of Congressional Relations and
Intergovernmental Affairs at [Redacted]. A similar letter has been sent
to your colleagues.
Sincerely,

Sonny Perdue,
Secretary.

Submitted Statement by Hon. Dusty Johnson, a Representative in Congress
from South Dakota and Hon. K. Michael Conaway, a Representative in
Congress from Texas; on Behalf of Mollie Van Lieu, Senior Director,
Nutrition Policy, United Fresh Produce Association
Review USDA's Farmers to Families Food Box Program
When COVID hit the U.S. in March, it brought with it an
unprecedented scenario: a dramatic increase in the number of vulnerable
and hungry people, food banks struggling to meet the demand to feed
them, and an overnight disruption in the fresh produce supply chain
with the closures of restaurants, schools, and food-service which wiped
out the customer base of 40 percent of fresh produce. As food banks
worked tirelessly privately to serve clients, and the industry worked
to divert highly perishable produce to food banks and grocery stores,
it became clear that the Federal Government was not equipped to provide
immediate assistance to this devastating situation.
Over the course of next 2 months, USDA developed a program to
deploy a supply chain that has worked behind the scenes for years in
getting Americans and the world fresh, nutrition produce; growers
provide their fresh fruits and vegetables to distributors that pack and
deliver consumer-ready fresh produce to the end-user. In the case of
Farmers to Families, the consumer was food banks and other emergency
feeding nonprofits, which could then distribute the family-style boxes
directly to clients in need. What resulted was not perfect but
represents a historic investment in fresh produce purchases by the
Federal Government.
Given the speed in which the government created a program, and its
relative inexperience with working with the full supply chain--there
were instances where the bidding did not work as it should. For
example, companies with no prior experience doing this highly
specialized work were awarded contracts in award amounts that would
have been better utilized spread across several companies. Highly
qualified companies that continue to face devastation have not been
awarded. In other cases, food banks were left shouldering costs they
did not anticipate. However, by the end of this summer, USDA will have
purchased $1.7 billion in domestic fresh produce and fresh produce
mixed boxes. This represents a larger purchase in 4 months than USDA
has made on fresh purchases in the past several years--combined.
As told in the attached letter by a number of awarded Farmers to
Families companies that the Agriculture Committee represents, when the
program is executed as intended--it is a win, win, win for the supply
chain, food banks, and the clients they serve. COVID has brought--and
continues to bring--exceptional challenges to the supply chain that
Farmers to Families cannot alone fix. But it has provided a lifeline to
many distributors and a customer base for domestic growers that
continue to struggle.
We are hopeful that this initiative continues to evolve and improve
so that we are better prepared should an emergency like this occur
again. When implemented as a complement to the SNAP program, a program
like this serves to help stabilize the supply chain while also
diverting food to those in need. It has shown that there is an
incredible demand for this high-quality, nutrient-dense food, and that
the nation has the supply chain in place to serve our nation's most
vulnerable, even beyond this crisis, to help ensure that all Americans

Dear Chairman Peterson, Ranking Member Conaway, Chair Fudge, and
Ranking Member Johnson:

On behalf of the undersigned distributors participating in the
Farmers to Families Program that are constituents of Members of the
House Agriculture Committee--we wish to thank you for your efforts to
ensure the program is run efficiently and effectively and share your
commitment to the u[t]most accountability of the program. Additionally,
we also share your belief that this program alone cannot solve hunger
and, accordingly, support an increase in SNAP benefits.
When COVID-19 closures hit restaurants, schools, and food-service
in March--the industry faced an emergency overnight--as 40 percent of
fresh produce goes to these sectors. The fresh produce supply chain
already runs on razor thin margins, and given that many of us primarily
serve food-service customers, this was devastating. While we worked
privately to divert product to retail and direct-to-consumer to retain
our workforce and continue to support growers, it was clear that the
private-sector alone could not address the crisis and the Federal
Government did not have a turnkey solution to address highly perishable
products like ours.
At the same time, unemployment was rising and our neighbors were
facing growing food insecurity, putting immense pressure on our local
food banks. Our companies represent a critical part of the supply chain
that--until recently--was mostly hidden from the public eye despite our
role in getting farm-fresh produce to consumers 365 days a year. Most
fresh produce distributors are small businesses with deep commitments
to our communities.
When the Farmers to Families program was launched nearly 2 months
later, it provided an unprecedented lifeline for our businesses and an
opportunity to support our neighbors. The bidding process was lightning
fast and was not without its challenges and shortcomings. Many of our
peers that were just as deserving were not awarded, and in most cases,
the demand for food at food banks surpasses the awards that were given
to us by USDA. Despite those facts, the impact that these awards have
had on our businesses and communities cannot go understated. We have:

delivered an unprecedented amount of nutrient-dense fresh
produce that has never been available through USDA purchasing
programs previously (More than 95% of USDA purchases are non-
fresh)

hand-packed and delivered consumer-ready boxes to minimize
food banks' and their clients' physical contact

supported domestic and local growers

retained and hired employees

fed hundreds of thousands of families during a time where
many had few options of where to turn in their time of need
Provides Efficient, Effective, and Safe Delivery
Our companies are highly skilled at procuring, packing, and
distributing fresh produce. As Eric Cooper from the San Antonio Food
Bank so eloquently stated at the July 21, 2020 hearing ``not all
contractors are equal''. In about a week's time from being notified
that we were awarded, our companies were able to deliver our first
round of deliveries. This is because we had existing relationships with
growers, our own facilities, established skill-sets, delivery vehicles,
and a talented workforce. Our employees are highly trained at food
safety measures and moving perishable food efficiently and effectively
and we believe the end product that we are delivering to food banks and
nonprofits reflects this. Contrary to some statements at the July 21,
2020 hearing, most of us are making direct deliveries to sites per the
mutually-agreeable terms of the contract.
To date, our companies have delivered more than one million boxes
with commodities including fresh apples, blueberries, butternut squash,
kale, strawberries, parsnips, peaches, sweet corn, sweet potatoes,
onions, romaine lettuce, honeydew, nectarines, radishes, artichokes,
and so much more.
Supports Local Jobs and Economy
As previously stated, most of us are small businesses with deep
roots in our community. Our employees are valued members and keeping
them employed was top priority. The Farmers to Families program allowed
us to retain and, in some cases, hire employees.
Supports Farmers
We of course are just one piece in this puzzle. Our valued grower
partners have also faced devastation as a result of the shutdown of
restaurants, schools, and food-service and we are proud to work with
them to help pack and deliver their produce to those in need. As
seasonally and geographically available, we make every effort to
procure local produce. All boxes are filled with domestic, American-
grown fruits and vegetables. The type of commodities included in our
boxes evolve as the growing season provides additional variety,
allowing for more access to locally grown produce.
Farmers to Families has provided a direct solution for some growers
that would have otherwise disked up their fields. In some instances,
small, local growers that are dependent on farmers' markets and white
tablecloth restaurants that shuttered were making plans to close down
their farm operations before Farmers to Families provided them an
avenue for their harvests.
Supplement not Supplant SNAP
During this unique crisis, we were deployed because our existing
skill-set was underutilized as a result of the food-service shutdown at
a time when food banks experienced historic levels of demand with
reduced storage, packing, and volunteer capacity. Despite the historic
investment by USDA in fresh produce, it is still not enough to solve
hunger. Our food bank and nonprofit partners cannot do it alone and we
do not believe that hungry Americans only option should be food banks.
Accordingly, we view the Farmers to Families program as an opportunity
to support agriculture and our local food banks during this time, but
not supplant SNAP. We support an increase in SNAP benefits during this
emergency.
We thank you once again for your commitment to agriculture,
nutrition, and hunger relief and ensuring the Farmers to Families
program keeps quality and integrity at the forefront. We would welcome
any Members of the Committee to visit our facilities and would be happy
to provide any additional information. We believe that this program has
value in helping Americans reach dietary guidelines recommendations for
fruit and vegetable consumption and we look forward to working with you
in the years to come to ensure that all Americans have access to fresh,
affordable fruits and vegetables.

Hon. Collin C. Peterson,             Hon. K. Michael Conaway,
Chairman,                            Ranking Minority Member,

Washington, D.C.;                    Washington, D.C.

Dear Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Conaway,

On behalf of Vermilion Valley Produce DBA Central Illinois Produce,
I write to you to highlight the success of the United States Department
of Agriculture's (USDA) Farmers to Families Food Box Program. During
this time of crisis due to the Coronavirus Pandemic, this program has
fulfilled a unique need within our local community and has continued to
build on the unique partnerships we've long held to help serve our
neighbors that have been negatively affected by job losses and state
mandated closures of local businesses,
We are a long-standing partner with many local food banks and
nonprofit organizations in central and southern Illinois including the
Eastern Illinois Foodbank in Champaign and Peoria and Midwest Foodbank
in Peoria, Bloomington, Fairfield, and Indianapolis, along with
nonprofit organizations like the Don Moyer's Boys and Girls Club of
Champaign and the United Way of Southern Illinois who coordinates with
hundreds of other nonprofits throughout southern Illinois. Through our
consistent work with these organizations that supply food to those in
need throughout the State of Illinois, we have established an
exceptional reputation for providing families with much needed, healthy
food.
On May 8, 2020 USDA announced that we would receive a contract for
$8.5 million. Since then we have been able to provide approximately
350,000 boxes of produce and dairy to tens of thousands of families. We
currently produce on average over 30,000 boxes of produce and dairy
boxes each week. We have been able to provide these boxes to families
throughout central and southern Illinois to cities as far reaching as
Cairo, Illinois. Recently we were notified that our contract was
extended through August 31, 2020,
Additionally, the Farmers to Families Food Box Program has also
been an intense success in terms of the number of employees we have
been able to safely retain and hire back in order to carry out the
program. Prior to the [COVID]-19 pandemic, we employed more than 130
full and part time employees in central Illinois; at the height of the
pandemic, prior to our contract for the Farmers to Families Food Box
Program contract, we were forced to cut our workforce nearly in half.
Because of this program, we have since rehired 16 employees who
were willing to come back to work despite the additional $600 weekly
Federal Government unemployment benefit which has created hiring
challenges for our box program. Thankfully we have worked with
employment agencies and currently have over 30 temporary employees on
staff helping to make the boxes, swelling our overall employment to
over 110 employees.
We are thrilled to be able to continue building on this successful
program and working to provide potatoes, onions, apples, oranges,
strawberries and locally grown lettuce, zucchini, cucumbers, peaches
and cantaloupes just to name some of the produce items we are putting
in the box. Our dairy box is almost all local producers including Ropp
Cheese in Bloomington, Kilgus Farms in Fairbury, and Prairie Farms in
Peoria providing blocks of cheese, yogurt, milk, cottage cheese and
butter to families in our community.
This program is a prime example of the success of well thought out
public-private partnerships filling important gaps in our communities.
As we work to consistently improve and serve more families through this
program, we are hopeful that we can continue such partnerships and use
this program as a model for success in the future.
We respectfully ask for your continued support of USDA's Farmers to
Families Food Box Program as we work to feed hungry families throughout
central and southern Illinois, and ask that you work to bolster and
enhance this program as we move through and past this pandemic.
Sincerely,

John Rollins,
President and CEO,
Venuilion Valley Produce DBA Central Illinois Produce.

Hon. Michael K. Conaway,

Dear Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Conaway:

As President of Borden Dairy Company, I am writing to express
gratitude for the Farmers to Families Food Box Program as well as
encouragement for your continued support and advocacy of this critical
initiative.
Based in Dallas, Borden has been in business since 1857 and employs
3,200 people who work to keep America fed. We operate 12 manufacturing
plants and nearly 100 distribution branches. Borden produces 35+
products enjoyed by millions of people every day, including children at
9,000 schools nationwide. Mid-size companies like ours employ more than
\1/4\ of our nation's workforce.
When COVID-19 began making its impact in the U.S., Borden lost
approximately 30% of its business virtually overnight due to school and
restaurant closures. The contract Borden was awarded through the
Farmers to Families Food Box Program enabled us to preserve employment
and benefits for our people. The opportunity has reinvigorated our
employees to fulfill this important mission of providing nutrition for
American families.
More importantly, Borden has supplied or scheduled donations for
nearly 1,000 charitable organizations across the country. By Aug. 31,
we anticipate we will have provided more than 11 million free gallons
of milk to people in need. These donations are reaching a wide range of
organizations, from large food banks in major metropolitan areas to
small town community churches and nonprofit organizations. As an
example, thanks to this program, the Extra Table organization in
Mississippi let us know that this is the first year in its history that
it has been able to provide fresh milk to the food banks and soup
kitchens it serves throughout the state. In addition, it is worth
noting that Congressman Conaway's constituents have likely benefited
from the 6,850 gallons of milk provided to the Food Bank of West
Central Texas.
Enclosed with this letter are a few messages we have received from
other recipient organizations and consumers in response to these
donations. As you will see from these messages--along with the hundreds
of news stories that have been published about Borden's involvement
with the Farmers to Families Food Box Program--the program's impact is
incredibly meaningful.
We urge you to continue supporting this initiative that is helping
so many Americans who are food-insecure as a result of this global
pandemic. Please do not hesitate to contact me at [Redacted] or
[Redacted] if you would like to discuss our experience with this
program in greater detail.
In the meantime, the Borden team continues to seek out and serve
additional organizations in need as the word spreads about this
terrific Federal Government program. The needs of the communities we
serve continue to grow, and we are here to help.
Thank you for your leadership and support of farmers, food
manufacturers and families in this time of crisis.
Sincerely,

Pat Boyle,
President,
Borden Dairy Company.

Good afternoon Gretchen and Kris,

We wanted to take a breathe to stop and say thank you again! You
probably saw all three of our large scale distributions over the last 3
weeks! Each event increased in scope from 100% to 50%! And thanks to
your product, efforts and financial support family was provide fresh
milk. And as we all know milk goes a long way from a refreshing
glassful, poured over cereal or an essential ingredient to some many
recipes!
Thank you again to both DairyMax and Borden for collaborating with
us on these special occasions!
Stay safe and well! I should mentioned the many smiles you missed
seeing as a member of the Air National Guard placed a gallon or 2 of
milk in their car!

In the Alabama heat Tuesday, volunteers and milk jugs sweat as

A red tractor-trailer emblazoned with the Borden smiling cow

drive-through style pickup, motorists pulled through the line as they
were handed gallons through windows and milk was put in their trunks.
The Dairy Alliance, a nonprofit that represents dairy farmers
across the southeast, partnered with Borden Dairy Co. to provide the
milk free of charge to community members at Garrett Coliseum.
Borden was awarded the U.S. Department of Agriculture's largest
contract through its Farmers to Families Food Box Program as part of
the Coronavirus Farm Assistance Program. The contract enables Borden to
supply 700 million servings of milk for free to qualifying nonprofits
like the Dairy Alliance.

Cowarts, AL

Dear Borden Dairy,

Thank you so much for your generous donation of 9,600 pounds of
milk to Prodisee Pantry. As you know, it's about hunger at Prodisee
Pantry. The COVID-19 Pandemic has us following our Emergency Operations
plan for Mass Emergency Food Distribution for Baldwin County families
in need. Since March 24th, our compassionate volunteers and caring
community have allowed us to distribute 5,966 family food units. That
is 135 tons of food provided to Baldwin County families to insure they
have food on the table and hope in their hearts. We will continue these
large-scale distributions as long as needed. Your support and prayers
makes this possible.
Please use this thank you as a tax deductible acknowledgement of
you contribution in which no goods or services were received by the
donor as a result of this gift. Let me know if you need any other
documentation. A heartfelt thanks for helping us fulfill our mission
found in Matthew 25:35[:] ``I was hungry and you gave me food, I was
thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you
welcome me.''
Blessings,

Deann Servos,
Executive Director.

Dear Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Conaway:

GA Foods is a specialized maker of nutrition-driven meals serving
the distinct nutritional needs of healthcare patients, seniors,
children, the military, and those affected by disasters. Our products
are marketed under the SunMeadow
'
brand name and are
available nationally through Meals on Wheels-type programs and health
insurance providers.
We believe that our mission is much larger than ``just food'' and
is best described as Nourishment. Delivered. Providing nourishment
includes food's vital nutrition and sustenance for life and the
strengthening and building up of one in need. This is who we are and
what we do. We include ``delivered'' in our mission because we,
literally, deliver our meals right to the kitchen of seniors and
healthcare patients. We also take pride in ``delivering'' when there is
a natural disaster, a tough situation, or even active combat locations
for our military.
My name is Ken LoBianco, and I founded GA Foods with my brother Jim
in 1973. We remain a family business with myself and my two sons
actively working in the business every day. With the pandemic outbreak,
senior centers across the country were forced to close to prevent
spreading the virus to their vulnerable population. Elective surgeries
were also delayed. Both disrupted demand for our services and products.
I am writing today to support the Farmers to Families Food Box Program,
which has allowed our company to retain our staff at 14 locations and
employ an additional 500 temporary workers since April.
Additionally, our team has seen firsthand how this program enabled
nonprofit organizations to meet the needs of so many in our community.
At each of the distribution sites, there were lines of cars with
families who, without your support, may not have had food for their
table.
The Farmers to Families Food Box Program perfectly combines
solutions to two problems: protecting vulnerable families while
providing an outlet for agricultural products that could have otherwise
gone to waste. I wholeheartedly support the program and appreciate
everyone involved in making it a reality.
Respectfully,

Ken LoBianco,
GA Foods,
St. Petersburg, FL.

My name is Charlene Johnson and I'm the executive director for
Plenty Doors Community Development Corporation (Plenty Doors CDC) on
the Crow Indian Reservation in southeast Montana. Plenty Doors CDC is a
[501(c)(3)] nonprofit organization that focuses on building a thriving
community by diversifying the economy and building individual and
community capacity.
Plenty Doors CDC had to shift it's focus to responding to the local
COVID response in March 2020. The Crow Reservation has been designated
as a persistent poverty area for decades. The primary industry was coal
and the Tribe was heavily dependent on the revenue from their coal
mines. The decline in the coal industry forced the Tribe to lay off
over 1,000 employees in 2017. In the spring of 2018, a fire damaged the
only local full service grocery store in Crow Agency. Access to
affordable groceries is at least 50 miles away, one way. This is an
issue with those without reliable transportation. Our communities had a
high unemployment and poverty rates prior to the pandemic. The pandemic
made a difficult situation even more difficult.
The food boxes from Farmers to Families have helped tremendously.
They provide our families with fresh good quality produce and protein
that families do not have access to due to lack of transportation and/
or inability to purchase.
Plenty Doors CDC supports the continuation of the Farmers to
Families Food Box Program. Many of our families will be without food
especially good quality produce and protein if this program is
discontinued.
Sincerely,

Charlene Johnson,

Dear Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Conaway:

Missouri Baptist Disaster Relief is a faith-based nonprofit
ministry of the Missouri Baptist Convention. We have served disaster
survivors since 1986 by providing, hot meals, flood and storm cleanup,
chaplaincy, temporary childcare, hot showers, clean laundry and other
ministry as needed. Approximately 2,000 volunteers are trained to serve
disaster survivors without discrimination, and we never charge for the
work because of the support from churches and donors.
I became aware of the USDA Farm[ers] to Famil[ies] program via a
local food supplier with whom I had been working. In addition, Missouri
State Emergency Management was helpful in pointing us toward ways we
could serve during the [COVID-19] crisis.
Thanks to the ease by which the USDA Farm[ers] to Famil[ies] Food
Box plan was implemented, over 97 churches and ministry agencies served
19,120 fresh produce boxes since June 15, 2020 in 32 Missouri counties.
The majority of the 75 cities we are serving are considered rural,
where access to food is more difficult than in the urban centers.
Recently, we gave several boxes of fresh produce to four families
living in one home. The demand for food is projected to increase, while
the national food supply chain is projected to continue at pre-[COVID]
levels.
I have told many of my colleagues and constituents that the USDA
Farm[ers] to Famil[ies] Food Box Program is one of the best I have
seen. It helps the farmer sell product, leverages the food supplier
network, provides a way for the nonprofit to serve, and best of all the
people get to eat! Thank you for creating an accessible program that is
simple with effective results.
Sincerely,

Gayton Moss,
Disaster Relief Director.

Dear Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Conaway:

My name is Nick Conforti and I am one of the owners of C&C Produce
in Kansas City, Missouri. We have been a fresh fruit and vegetable
wholesale distributor since 1992. Our company was fortunate to receive
a contract with the USDA Farmers to Families Food Box Program this
year. C&C Produce is not new to government contracts and I felt it
important to share some firsthand experiences and insights with
Congress.
As a business where nearly $70,000,000 of our revenue comes from
restaurants, business cafeterias, and related food service
organizations, C&C Produce was hit hard when COVID-19 struck and cities
around the country instituted stay-at-home orders. We had perishable
product go to waste, our 250 employees were concerned about their job
security, and our growers feared for the crops that had already been
planted. In one swift motion, the Farmers to Families Food Box Program
solved all of these issues.
From the outside looking in, it is easy to see the USDA only
distributing 25 million packages of food as a failure; however, when
you consider the monumental supply chain activities that took place, it
should be considered as an incredible government success. First, the
USDA should be commended for the speed in which they acted. The program
went from RFP to contract awards in just 2 weeks, a pace that is
unheard of in government contracts. Second, awarded companies had to
source product, create packing lines to make the boxes, staff those
packing lines, find nonprofit organizations that had the capacity to
receive and distribute the product, and arrange transportation to get
the product to the organizations. This type of program was new to the
entire industry, to expect for this program to roll out flawlessly and
at full capacity would be irresponsible.
I want to share some numbers that reflect the positive impact the
Farmers to Families program has had. To date, C&C Produce has
distributed nearly 900,000 boxes of fresh produce under this program.
That is 22,500,000 pounds of fresh produce to an average of 2,826,000
people (assuming the average family size is 3.14 persons) in need
across nine states with the help of over 300 nonprofit organizations.
These boxes haven't just gone to major food banks in large metropolitan
areas, they are going to hubs that are distributing to dozens of other
organizations that stretch across the region. They are going to rural
churches who are serving populations that have no other outlet to find
help. They are going to small organizations that deliver boxes door to
door to the elderly or those that cannot afford transportation to pick
them up. They are going to Tribal Reservations to help the Native
American populations. They are going to inner city areas designated as
food deserts where there is little to no access to healthy foods. Just
as no subset of the population was left unimpacted by the COVID crisis,
no subset of the population has been left unaided by the Farmers to
Families program.
I believe one of the biggest benefits of this program has yet to be
seen. I ask that Congress consider the potential long-term outcomes of
providing fresh, healthy food to people in need. Unarguably, fruits and
vegetables have a positive impact on an individual's health. What will
the savings to Medicare and Medicaid look like after just 6 months of
having regular access healthy food?
In addition to the direct help of people in need, America's farmers
have found help and confidence in the Farmers to Families program. When
COVID caused restaurants to close, countless growers were terrified
that their entire crop could be lost. Frequently, small growers invest
their future in what they plant. If there was suddenly no one to buy
that product, their future could be devastated. Because of this
program, farmers have an outlet for their products and the confidence
to continue planting. Furthermore, because they have the confidence to
continue planting, the produce industry will avoid a catastrophe that
would have happened if growers would have stopped growing resulting in
huge shortages and inflated prices causing even fewer people to have
access to fresh food.
The impact for C&C Produce has helped our community as well.
Because of the Farmers to Families program, we have been able to add
nearly 100 jobs at our facility. We market these jobs to people who are
temporarily out of work because of business closures. Additionally, we
fulfilled and added to our purchasing commitments to small, local
growers. And we have been fortunate enough to witness first-hand how
many organizations and volunteers there are willing to come together to
help their neighbors in need.
In closing and on behalf of over 2.8 million people C&C Produce has
been able to help, I want to thank Congress and the USDA for making the
Farmers to Families Food Box Program available. I hope my writing
highlights how much of a positive impact you have made on so many
people who are struggling in these difficult times. We continue to see
the need for this program grow each week and we urge Congress to
continue to provide people the means to access healthy food. Thank you
for your consideration.
Sincerely,

Nick Conforti,

Dear Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Conaway:

My name is Mark Blomberg and I am the President of Western Missouri
Fruit Sales, Inc. in Waverly, Missouri. We are a MO Apple Shipper/
Exclusive Sales Agent for two family owned orchards in MO. One of those
being the largest in the state, Peters Orchards, as well as Rasa
Orchards. We started our company in 1989. Peters Orchards has been in
business since 1908, who currently have 20+ full time employees and
more than 120 employees during harvest/packing. Rasa Orchards has been
in business for 75+ years and currently have 10+ full time employees
and more than 60 employees during harvest/packing.
I am writing today in support of the Farmers to Families Food Box
Program, which has helped our company get through this global pandemic
and economic crisis we have all been battling. The importance of this
program cannot be overstated. No matter who you are, what line of work
you are in or where you live, coronavirus has affected you. As a member
of a rural community, business owner and husband/father of five, I
support this program because I know that our apples are going to
families who are struggling during these times and might not be able to
afford food for their families, let alone fresh produce without this
program. I also support this program because it keeps a market for our
apples and more importantly, keeps food on the table and a roof over
the head of not only my family but my fellow employees' families as
well. Farmers to Families is helping companies like ours to keep our
business running through this pandemic.
When this pandemic hit in mid-March, our business almost came to a
standstill. With schools closing early, restaurants/food-service
closing and grocers trying to keep their inventory to absolute minimums
in fear of being forced to close, we had nowhere to go with our apples.
We did not know if we would be able to keep our business afloat. Our
growers were doing everything they could to keep their employees busy
while trying to decide if they should continue caring for the upcoming
new crop of apples or bite the bullet and quit while they were ahead.
Thankfully one of our long-standing and loyal customers, C&C
Produce, Inc. out of Kansas City, Missouri, was awarded a contract for
the Farmers to Families Food Box Program. They were gracious enough to
offer us a bid to sell our apples to them for the food boxes. We were
amazed at the sight of their organized and highly efficient packing
line they have designed for these boxes when we recently visited their
facility. Seeing our fruit packed alongside the other quality produce
they have procured to fill these boxes makes us proud to be a part of
their operation and more importantly to serve those in need.
The Farmers to Families Food Box Program has been a blessing to so
many struggling families by connecting farmers with food banks and
hungry families that need help and support. I support this program and
am thankful to be a part of a solution to meet such a pressing need
during these unpredictable times.
Sincerely,

Mark Blomberg,

Washington, D.C.

Dear Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Conaway:

My name is John Zombolas and I am President of Mc[F]arling Foods in
Indianapolis, one of the proud partners in the USDA Farmers to Families
Food Box Program. Locally owned and operated since 1948, McFarling
Foods is an employee-owned, full-service broadline food distributor
serving restaurants, institutional food service operations, and
community organizations within a 2 hour radius. We have a proud history
of offering our customers the freshest ingredients necessary to remain
and become successful in the food service industry. We take every
opportunity to support local growers and domestic manufacturers in
delivering products to our network of customers and have nurtured long
standing relationships with producers who are focused on quality.
I am writing today in support of the Food Box Program, which has
helped our Company endure the operational and economic challenges of
the pandemic while affording us the privilege of getting food to those
families who very much need support during these times. McFarling Foods
felt the full weight of the pandemic crash down upon us as most of the
customers we serve are restaurants, all of which have been forced to
curtail operations in one form or another for protracted periods.
Although our business suffered as a result, we chose to use our time to
reach out to those in our community and supported many charitable
endeavors early on to help stock food pantries, churches, and other
charitable organizations. While these actions galvanized my employees
and united them in rising above our own misfortune through service to
individuals in our communities with greater need, our reach was limited
by our limited resources. We did the best we could do on our own, but
still had to look ahead to how we would weather the storm ourselves and
keep all of our team members employed when many other companies in our
industry were furloughing or terminating 40-50% of their workforce.
Being granted the award to participate in the Food Box Program gave us
the opportunity to do what we know we can do very well--distribute
food--with a combination box comprised of items sourced from domestic
producers with whom we have a long history. We wanted to include as
many producing partners we could in order to build a box with a variety
of food items that would substantially feed a family for several days.
This Program allowed us to reach far more families in need and develop
new charitable relationships than we ever could have accomplished on
our own.
The importance of this program cannot be overstated. Our business
was thrown an important lifeline when we needed it most. I was able to
keep all of my 100 employees gainfully employed and have been able to
offer work to even more individuals, both on a temporary and permanent
basis. My McFarling Foods team members have found the work to be very
gratifying and this program has engendered a feeling of solidarity by
providing these food boxes, while we also work diligently to support
our core customers as they struggle to contend with the operational
challenges the coronavirus has forced upon them. Most importantly, we
are humbled that we can be part of an effort that demonstrates how
adversity can bring out the best in people who genuinely want to help
one another find a way through these unprecedented obstacles . . .
together.
Over the past several weeks that the Food Box Program has been
running, we have received countless indications of gratitude from the
charitable sponsors with whom we partner to distribute these boxes, and
the individual recipients themselves. The response has been
resoundingly positive. Without question, the Farmers to Families Food
Box Program has been a blessing to so many struggling families by
connecting farmers with food banks and the families that need help now
more than ever before. I support this program wholeheartedly and am
thankful to be a small part in meeting such a pressing need during this
crisis.
Sincerely,

John Zombolas

McFarling Foods Inc.,

Dear Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Conaway:

Our team at Operation Food Secure (a joint effort of the Topeka
Rescue Mission, the United Way of Greater Topeka, and the City of
Topeka) would like to share our support and appreciation for the USDA
Farmers to Families Food Box Program. In just a few weeks, we have
joined hands with thirty partner organizations to distribute over 7,000
boxes of fresh produce, dairy products, and fluid milk across five
northeast Kansas counties.
These boxes come from hardworking American farmers and farmworkers,
who originally raised the food for a different segment of the supply
chain. Farmers to Families, authorized by the CARES Act, purchases food
that would otherwise be wasted and redistributes it to nonprofits like
ours that are providing hunger relief.
We have joined forces to engage social service organizations,
churches, neighborhood improvement associations, and other community
groups to move food into areas that need it most. Our local U.S. Foods,
Reser's Fine Foods, and Mars plants have donated refrigerated trailers
for us to receive, store, and redistribute 1,760 food boxes each week.
We have also developed new relationships with dozens of volunteers who
wholeheartedly support the vision of this program.
The pandemic has left so many families struggling with hunger and
food insecurity. Furthermore, many of our rural communities and Tribes
face additional barriers to food access like pervasive food deserts,
food cost disparities, and transportation challenges. These struggles
can hamper healthy eating habits and create nutritional inequity in
states like ours. Some of our partner organizations transport food over
40 miles outside of Topeka to provide fresh food to rural families.
Farmers to Families presents an exciting opportunity to bring fresh
fruits, vegetables, and dairy products to the doorstep of small-town
America.
We've come to find this effort is about so much more than food.
These food boxes have served as a vehicle to strengthen the community,
build new relationships, and sow seeds of hope amidst the storm of this
pandemic.

Barry Feaker,
Executive Director, Topeka Rescue Mission Ministries;

Dear Chairman Peterson, Ranking Member Conaway, Representative Jim
Hagedorn and Turner Bridgforth and Representative Rodney Davis and
Janie Costa:

Prairie Farms Dairy has been a Farmer-Owned Cooperative since 1938,
with over 825 farm families.
Prairie Farms has been proud to partner with the USDA on the
Farmers to Families Program. We have seen first-hand the incredible
impact this program has had on our local communities. We have received
hundreds of calls and emails from individuals thanking us for our
participation and sharing their personal stories with us. It is evident
that food insecurity is a prevalent issue during these unprecedented
times and this program has provided those in need with a way to
overcome some of that difficulty.
For Prairie Farms Dairy, this program has been a bright spot in a
very challenging time. This program has had a positive impact on
Prairie Farms Dairy in a variety of ways. First, it has provided an
outlet for our dairy products. With most schools and restaurants
closed, the demand for a lot of our items has been reduced
significantly. This program has offset that dip in demand and allowed
us to put that milk to good use.
The program has also allowed us to maintain, or even expand, our
workforce. The dairy variety box concept is a new and very innovative
opportunity for the dairy industry. This innovative program has allowed
us to maintain our workforce at our production facilities and, in some
cases, we've been able to hire additional help in order to fulfill this
opportunity.
We experienced historic decreases in the dairy markets at the start
of the coronavirus. For many of our farmer owners, this presented them
with substantial financial difficulty. Ongoing months with market
losses and low prices would have caused many of them to face serious
financial hardship. This program has played a significant role in
stabilizing the dairy markets and bringing pricing back to levels where
our farm families can earn a living, while also providing much needed
food for those without jobs.
Prairie Farms Dairy has had a relationship with the USDA for
several years and has been part of many of their purchasing programs.
Because of this ongoing relationship, when we saw the announcement of
the Farmers to Families Program, we knew that we would be the perfect
fit for this type of program.
We are already so connected to the communities that we serve, we
felt we had an obligation to rise to this challenge to make sure those
communities were provided for in these challenging times.
Prairie Farms Dairy has seen firsthand the benefit that this
program has been to local communities and agriculture professionals
across the country. We support this program and everything that it has
accomplished in a very short amount of time. We look forward to
continuing our partnership with the USDA on this program and making
sure that those struggling during these difficult times are provided
for.
Sincerely,

Ed Mullins,
CEO,
Prairie Farms Dairy,
Edwardsville, IL.

not be duplicated here.

Dear Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Conaway:

Citygate Network is North America's oldest and largest community of
independent, faith-based crisis shelters and life-transformation
centers. In most U.S. cities, a member of Citygate Network is the most
comprehensive homeless services provider, and in some cities, it is the
only homeless services provider. With that background, I'd like to
share my perspective and support for the Farmers to Families Food Box
Program (F2F).
When we first introduced F2F to our members--approximately 300
rescue missions and similar ministries--they had many questions about
the feasibility of such a massive undertaking. The questions came from
a desire (actually a commitment) to serve with excellence and not
under-deliver. Our members regularly step into difficult roles as an
extension of their faith; however, the COVID-19 crisis required an all-
hands-on-deck approach to their already stretched programs. While some
organizations with limited resources had to bow out to prioritize
keeping their vulnerable guests safe, housed, fed, and healthy, others
with more capability stepped up to the plate, boldly trusting the
vision of the program.
The role of Citygate Network has always been to provide its members
with leadership and representation that inspires, advocates, educates,
and represents their interests so they can lead life transformation
ministries. For more than 100 years, we've faithfully served in this
capacity and witnessed amazing results. Informing and encouraging our
members to embrace the F2F program was a natural fit with results that
far exceeded our expectations.
So many of the USDA programs provide vital lifelines to food
service providers, but not one of them can work efficiently on their
own. The F2F program facilitated the delivery of life-sustaining food
boxes to needy families across the country. In many cases, this
distribution system reached vulnerable families and individuals in dire
need, creating new relationships and opening doors to other community
services.
While we have been doing this work for a long time, it never gets
old to see broken people filled with new hope, like they were when they
received F2F food boxes. Communities have come together around this
visionary program and lives have been impacted in their greatest hour
of need.
Creative solutions like F2F compliment the many Federal and local
programs available, closing the gaps that poverty leaves. In this case,
we've learned a lot about meeting needs in hard to reach places, and
neighbors willing to drive that last mile to make sure someone gets
fed. The Farmers to Families program provides a unique and healthy way
to make a difference across the country, and we encourage you to
continue supporting this innovative approach.
Respectfully,

John Ashmen,
President.

Dear Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Conaway:

I'd like to share with you about two of our smallest ministry
members. Both have participated in the Farmers to Families Food Box
Program (F2F) and their results are encouraging. One is located in a
very rural part of North Carolina and the other provides services in
the heart of downtown San Antonio, Texas. Each has a heart for service
that is unique to their community. The Brunswick County Recovery Center
(BCRC) in Ash, NC offers addiction programs to men and women on
separate campuses with a deep dedication to gospel-powered life
transformation. The Church Under the Bridge (CUB) ministry in San
Antonio is primarily an outreach and emergency shelter program that
provides public dinners and a church home to San Antonio's
impoverished.
When the F2F program was first introduced to Citygate Network
members, the leaders at BCRC said, ``We absolutely need to do this for
our community.'' I asked them if they had adequate space to meet the
requirements and they said, ``No, but through our partners at the local
police and fire departments, the school district, the churches, the
medical centers, and the many eldercare partners we work with, it'll be
a cinch.'' Admittedly, I had my doubts, but figured it couldn't hurt
for them to give it their best shot. As it turns out, thanks to their
healthy partnerships, they were able to deliver a seemingly endless
supply of food boxes to their community in a single day! Lines formed
from multiple community hubs where families could pick up groceries,
while other volunteers took boxes directly to residences without any
form of transportation. Since that first day, they've received
additional deliveries and have continued to bridge hunger gaps while
expanding partnerships in their community to address needs.
Because of their relatively small size, The Church Under the Bridge
(CUB) in San Antonio did not sign up to participate in the F2F program
at first. However, when a full truck was stuck in San Antonio with no
place to deliver, we reached out to CUB and they coordinated 200
volunteers to help deliver and distribute every box within a matter of
hours.
These two organizations demonstrate the importance of empowering
community effort. Neighbors serving neighbors to bring about family
stability. The visionary solutions of F2F have brought the right people
together and created opportunities for meaningful partnerships to form.
Some of the relationships built will serve as a portal into the most
vital programs of the community and eventually bring about stability.
Others form caring relationships that inspire hope. F2F is an
affordable option allowing every community to engage in the fight
against hunger and poverty. I urge you to do what it takes to keep this
innovative program alive and well for years to come.
Faithfully yours,

Sam Edwards,
Director of Member Engagement,
Citygate Network.

I wanted to take a moment and thank you on behalf of the 33,674
people that received roughly 444,000 pounds of food over the past
several weeks. Our organization, Love Has No Limits Inc., was created
to serve individuals in Los Angeles, CA and across the United States.
Our organizations specializes in unifying thousands of faith
communities and charities through unified events that produce lasting
change.
Hundreds of our communities across southern California have been
impacted by COVID-19 and as a result organizations have rolled up their
sleeves to serve those in our community who need it most. I can speak
for thousands of families when I tell you that this program has changed
lives across southern California. Every week we have precious families
who arrive and wait for hours in the hopes of receiving aid, and when
they receive it, their gratitude and thankfulness is hard to describe.
We are so grateful for all that you have done to make this program
a reality and look forward to continuing the work we have started.

Dear Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Conaway:

My name is Al Ferry and I'm the Associate Pastor at the Living
Waters Oildale Seventh Day Adventist Church in Bakersfield, Ca. Our
church is currently comprised of many members that have been in
attendance for decades. The community our church is located in is a
residential neighborhood of poor to low-income families.
The location we occupy presents a high need of concerned help to
our neighbors, spiritually as well as materially. Because of COVID-19,
we have realized a greater financial loss in our area. Loss of work has
brought a tremendous need for feeding our local families, wherever
possible.
The Farmers to Families program has brought an overwhelming,
positive response. Receiving fresh fruit and vegetables, delivering
these to those that are hurting, has brought great joy, not only to our
neighbors but to all of our involved church members as well. It's
exciting to see hope fulfilled.
I received a letter of gratitude, from one family that I believe
would prove the happiness that has blossomed throughout our area. It's
from Mr. and Mrs. Robert Canley. This couple has adopted two of their
nieces, out of necessity and both Mr. and Mrs. are both retired, with a
limited income. Mrs. (Cathy) wrote, ``Thank you! Thank you! Thank
you!!! These words are not enough for all the blessings you've poured
out on me and my family. You've taught us that giving is such an
important part of helping others. Even when it's hot, all of you have
been out there carrying and delivering these wonderful boxes of food.
One of our neighbors, Gus, his wife and five kids, told us they all run
out when they see your people coming. He said there's so much laughing
and they're so thankful for what your church does. I've seen Gus and
most of the time there are tears running down his cheeks.''
We are praying that the Farmers to Families program won't end, at
least until things get much better. I'm sure what your doing has
brought much happiness to people, wherever this program is implemented.
Thank you for allowing our church to be a part of this. Our prayers are
with you.

Dear Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Conaway:

My name is Jim Craig and I am the Associate Pastor at the Living
Waters Assembly of God in Lamont, California. Our church is comprised
of mostly poor, farm laborers, and small business owners from Lamont
and the surrounding areas. Most of our congregation are elderly and are
part of the history of this area and our great nation.
Our community is mostly Hispanic and most speak little or no
English. But they are proud to be living in Lamont and be a part of the
United States of America. The people here are hardworking and
respectful and proud of the work they are doing.
The Farmers to Families program has been a blessing to so many
families in our area. These are families who live from payday to payday
and often must scrounge for everything they have. That is why they are
so proud of what they do have.
When we show up at a family's doorstep with a box of produce, the
entire family usually greets us at the door with huge smiles. Because
of the pandemic, we have to resist the urge to give and receive hugs
from the entire family.
The pandemic has affected our church tremendously because most
churches are almost family outings. It has scared many of them into
becoming hermits and living in fear in their homes. Afraid and alone,
and most have lost hope.
These are the people we reach out to. We have many people we
purposely take food boxes to weekly. Some we have met simply by
knocking on their door and showing them love.
We listen to people. To their fears. To their concerns. To their
hearts. Some tell us about other families that may be in greater need.
We visit that family. We help them with food. We help them with
physical needs. We are there for them spiritually. We are there to show
them love.
Some of these families are family members (children) of felons who
are incarcerated and we make sure those children are able to have
Christmas despite the fact there parent(s) may be locked up during this
time. We visit these families also and supply them with boxes of
produce from the Farmers to Families program.
These boxes enable us to reach out to families who may feel alone
and unwanted, and not sure of how they can make ends meet. Because of
the generosity of this program, they get more than they ever expected.
They get love and concern from a church family they never knew they
had.
It is never just a box of produce. It is a whole lot more.
One lady lost her husband a year or so ago. She has four (4)
children. She works in the field. We showed up at her house and brought
her a box of produce. She could not talk. She could only cry. Then she
told us her story. She went from being some lady to being Adriana.
We take her boxes when we receive them. We have gone from being
strangers alone in our community to being family. All because of a box
of produce.
I have given you one example of how a box of produce has changed a
life. However, I have a whole lot more stories like this. I feel like I
am the luckiest man on Earth. I get to go out into my community and
shower people with love. And sometimes change their lives. All because
of a box of produce.
Thank you for making this happen. Your generosity has made so many
great things happen in our community. I spent twenty-seven years with
the Kern County Sheriff's Office and felt I made a huge difference in
so many lives, but that pales in comparison with the opportunities you
have provided--with a box of produce.

Dear Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Conaway:

My name is Troy Singleterry, and I'm the Lead Pastor of City View
Church which is comprised of English, Spanish and Ethiopian speaking
congregations. Nestled in the heart of San Diego, CA, our
multigenerational and multi-ethnic congregations reach people from all
walks of life, including many military families, throughout San Diego
County.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused many families in our church and
community to lose jobs or have work hours cut, which in turn has
dramatically reduced their resources. This has left them worried and
hopeless mentally, financially, and physically. Our volunteers, not
only from our church but occasionally others from local businesses,
military personnel, and political leaders and staff, serve with hearts
of compassion and a desire to make every person who comes to get a box
of food feel valued, loved and accepted. How fulfilling it has been to
witness the joy on people's faces, the hope kindled in their spirits,
and hear the appreciation they have expressed for these boxes of
quality food.
As a HUB for San Diego County, we not only have reached thousands
in our community, but we also partner with about 30 local churches and
para ministry organizations to reach our county and help those in need.
Since May 29, we've been able to distribute over 26,500 boxes of food
to people here in San Diego County.
Compassion is breeding compassion as people serve their neighbors,
families, and friends. Thank you so much for launching this much-needed
program during these trying times for America. It has been our highest
honor and privilege to serve our community through the Farmers to
Families Food Box Program.
Sincerely,

Pastor Troy Singleterry,
Lead Pastor, City View Church.

Dear Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Conaway:

My name is Karl Hargestam and I am the Executive Director of
CityServe Network, based in Bakersfield, CA. We are a collaborative
network of churches and community leaders connected to overcome despair
in the community. The network expands throughout southern California
and extends to Washington and Nevada. Currently, the network is made up
of 38 HUBs who receive, sort, and distribute food and other necessities
to 1,000+ PODs (point of distribution). CityServe PODs take the
resources into their neighboring communities and deliver them to the
most vulnerable people in need.
When the pandemic hit we knew the CityServe HUB/POD distribution
model, which was in place prior to the crisis, could reach families
that are affected most by the shifted economy. More often than not,
food is being delivered through, what we call, the ``Last Mile of
Need.'' Households in the ``Last Mile of Need'' are families with food
needs that are often unmet for a variety of reasons. The deficiency of
government agencies and most nonprofits to reach these households,
mostly due to program capacity, creates a risk of malnutrition and
starvation--which is particularly true for households with young
children.
I'm writing to you today to express my support of the USDA Farmers
to Families Food Box Program and ask that it continues forward during
this challenging time. We have seen in various ways how this program
has been a unique solution to the many problems brought on by the
COVID-19 pandemic. Low-income families who were working hard to make
ends meet in their homes before the pandemic are now having to make
hard decisions on whether their household funds go towards food or
shelter.
These families are scared and are losing hope. They shouldn't have
to feel this way when we live in the greatest country with an abundance
of fresh, nutritious foods. The alarming amount of food that has been
wasted because of the abrupt halt in our national food supply is not
necessary and is why the food box program is an excellent solution.
The food box program is feeding hungry families but it is also
providing hope during the darkest time the world has ever seen. One of
our church PODs in Bakersfield shared a story of a man who had reached
a dark point of depression. With young children at home, the man was
overcome with despair because of the loss of a job, money, and food and
was about to take his own life. But he saw the church sign that read
``FREE FOOD'' and it gave him hope. The man did not turn to suicide for
the answer. He got food for his family and connects with the church
congregation on a regular basis for resources from the food box
program.
We know the Farmers to Families Food Box Program is making a
difference in the lives of millions of families. CityServe Network
supports this program because it supplies food in the ``Last Mile of
Need,'' it offers hope during this tragic season, and it demonstrates
our country's resiliency and ability to come together and triumph in
the midst of chaos.
Sincerely,

Karl Hargestam,
Executive Director,

Dear Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Conaway:

My name is Susana Beltran and I'm an Associate Pastor at El Buen
Pastor Church in McFarland, California. Our church is comprised of
mostly Hispanic families in a small community of predominantly Hispanic
farmworkers.
The Farmers to Families has been a blessing to our church and
community. We have seen many families hit hard financially during this
[COVID-19]/quarantine time and the produce & protein boxes we have been
able to distribute have helped the situation greatly.
It might be easy to think that the affect of this pandemic is not
as bad as we think but the numbers do not lie. Even in our small
community, week after week, we see over 250 to 300 people drive thru to
receive help in the form of the produce & protein boxes. This pandemic
does not discriminate: Everyone need help.
We had a lady drive thru at a recent distribution who would seem
out of place at a food giveaway. She rolled in on a SUV & as she drove
thru the line, the tears started to fall. She never expected to
``need'' the help but the pandemic had touched her family & she wasn't
sure where her next meal would come from. The financial weight the
pandemic had caused was made a little lighter knowing that she wouldn't
have to worry for a meal for her family for at least 2 weeks.
During another distribution, towards the end of our time out there,
a car full of farmworkers pulled up. As we loaded their trunk with the
protein boxes, they expressed their gratitude & told us they were just
notified it was their last day at work so they were grateful to not
have to worry about a meal.
We know that Farmers to Families has truly been a blessing to every
single person that comes through & it has also been a blessing to every
single one of our Ministry Volunteers. Thank you to everyone involved
in the Farmers to Families Food Box P[r]ogram. We hope you continue the
amazing work that has been of great help to so many.
Sincerely,

Susana G. Beltran.

Honorable Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Conaway:

I am writing in regards to the Farmers to Families Food Box Program
that has helped hundreds of families receive food in my district and
thousands throughout our region.
As you know, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in severe job loss
and disruption throughout our nation. Thankfully, City View Church head
pastor Troy Singleterry and his congregation has stepped up during this
crisis to serve as a hub for this program in San Diego County. The
church has tirelessly organized 35 other local churches and
organizations to distribute over 26,000 boxes of food to struggling San
Diego families.
Through the Farmers to Families Food Box Program and City View
Church's hard work, the hub has become a vital resource for our region.
If the programs discontinues, it would create severe distress to
working families already struggling to tread water during this
unprecedented pandemic.
I respectfully request your strong consideration to continue this
vital food program during these hard times. For any questions or
comments, please don't hesitate to contact me personally at [Redacted]

Dear Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Conaway:

My name is Rich Shepherd and I'm the Campus Pastor at Canyon Hills
in San Luis Obispo, CA. Our church is comprised of many different age
ranges and social backgrounds. We would be considered a college town,
but also a town of young families and the elderly.
The reason that I support the Farmers to Families program is
because of its dedication to help those in need. We have been blown
away by the response of our community and in the 2 short weeks doing
it, have ran out. The need is so big. I've seen countless families come
through and with tears in their eyes share just how much this helps
them. Because of schools being shut down, families not receiving lunch
meals for their kids have said this is such a help.
This pandemic has affected our town so much because it is built on
small business and travel. Because of that, many hotel, restaurant, and
customer service business have closed and these families have felt the
impact of it.
One thing that stands out to me is the people who have stepped up
to serve these families. Volunteers have come to give 6 hours of their
time to help. Because of that, they have looked into the eyes of those
people and have acquired a greater compassion level for those in need.
Truly irreplaceable! Our mayor has joined us for 2 straight weeks and
can't get enough of it.
I cannot stress enough how much this program has impacted our city.
Our mayor and town officials have been blown away by the response as
well as the news media as they have come out and witnessed the lines
backing up onto other streets. I support and commend the Farmers to
Families Food Box Program and can't thank them enough!
Sincerely,

Rich Shepherd,

Dear Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Conaway:

My name is Rod Haro and I'm the Lead Pastor at the Fowler Worship
Centre church in Fowler, Ca. We are a rural church located in the heart
of an agricultural community. Our church is multi-cultural and the
economic demographic is low-income to middle class. We are a community-
minded church with a great emphasis on compassion ministry. We have six
other Worship Centre campuses that are located in more impoverished
rural communities.
Our community and the Central Valley has been hit extremely hard by
the current pandemic crisis. Many families have lost their jobs and are
experiencing such challenging times economically. We as a church have
been working hard to secure the one thing that these families need most
. . . food to feed their families.
Farmers to Families Food Box Program has been a invaluable resource
and a tremendous blessing to our community. Because of this program we
are able to supply thousands of families all over this valley with
fresh, quality produce. People are lined up hours in advance at our
weekly food outreach because of the great need for food. In addition we
are able to service 20 other local churches and community outreach
partners as they in turn resource their communities and neighborhoods.
The Farmers to Families program in a very practical way is what the
spirit of America is all about. People helping people in their times of
need. It creates a spirit of unity and connection as those less
fortunate realize that others care and that their needs are important
to those in their society.
Thank you to the Farmers to Families program for making such an
impact on so many peoples lives in this most trying of times in our
nation. The people who receive these much needed resources thank you
and our prayer is that this program will continue to be available to
those who truly depend on this program.

Dear Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Conaway:

My name is Jared Waterfield and I am the Director of Marketing for
Military Produce Group located in Norfolk, Virginia. We are proud
partners of the United States Military community, having enjoyed 2
decades of distributing fresh fruits and vegetables to the Defense
Commissary Agency. In addition to our facility in Norfolk, we operate
fresh produce distribution centers in Birmingham, Alabama and Savannah,
Georgia. This geographical footprint enables us to place great emphasis
on supporting local and Veteran owned farms throughout the eastern
United States. When the opportunity to support communities within our
reach arose in the form of the Farmers to Families program, we knew we
were not only built for the mission, but that we had a duty to do our
part in helping to ensure it is successful.
The USDA Farmers to Families Food Box program has had such a
positive impact on all aspects of the produce supply chain. For the
American farmer, it has provided a much-needed outlet for their produce
to reach the community. Product originally destined for restaurants and
food service, that would otherwise go to waste, is now available to the
dinner tables of families in need. For distributors, the Farmers to
Families program has kept packing lines operational, distribution
centers running, and supported ongoing employment in the agriculture
industry. But most importantly, this program has helped fragile
communities impacted by the pandemic, preventing them from falling into
a ``food desert'' in their own towns. Through the Farmers to Families
Food Box program, Military Produce Group has been empowered to help
these communities, no matter how out of reach they may appear, ensuring
that nutritious food options are not limited only to families who
remain financially fortunate.
We are grateful for the opportunity that Farmers to Families has
provided and humbled by the ground floor stories we have heard from
community leaders while supporting the initiative. When we received
notice that we were awarded a contract within the program, we worked
quickly to contact food banks, nonprofits, and faith-based entities
that were experienced in serving communities in need. Partnerships were
swiftly developed and communication between our team and local
organizations became ever-increasing. We heard stories of families that
had not had fresh vegetables in weeks and communities with thousands of
people lining up hours in advance of a distribution event, just to
ensure they received fresh food while it was available for a limited
time. Frequently after making our first food box deliveries, we were
asked to increase both the frequency and number of boxes we were
delivering due to increasing and unprecedented demand. It became clear
that organizers were doing a fantastic job of spreading the word that
these boxes were available and coordinated ever-growing, ever-improving
events to ensure distributions were efficient. Food-insecure
communities were further identified through reaching out to
organizations such as Convoy of Hope, Community Foodbanks of NJ, the
Federation of Virginia Food Banks, and the North Carolina Dept. of
Agriculture. Each partnership helped to identify more areas of need and
more stories of hardship wrought on rural America.
As we continue to support the Farmers to Families program, we
maintain our lines of communication with the organizers and
representatives throughout the communities we serve. We have seen
photos from events large and small, full of volunteers unloading
thousands of boxes by hand. Videos of cars lined up for miles waiting
for a food distribution to begin. Letters and phone calls from
representatives telling us of their efforts and the community response
while requesting additional distributions. Throughout every area the
feedback has been the same--grateful communities, desperate for
nutritious food, are coming together to do everything they can to
support each other.
The Farmers to Families Food Box program continues to be essential
in keeping towns like those described here from falling apart during
the pandemic. Through this program farmers, distributors, nonprofits,
and American communities have created a network that ensures our food
supply is directed to those who benefit most. Providing this necessary
food supply chain for impacted families ensures we can keep our nation
healthy, our children fed, and families free from the fear of food
insecurity. Military Produce Group is proud to participate in such an
initiative and encourages the ongoing support and funding for the
Farmers to Families Food Box program.
Sincerely,

Jared C. Waterfield,
Military Produce Group,
Norfolk VA.

Dear Representative Conaway,

Thank you for your leadership on behalf of America's farmers and
ranchers, especially in such trying times.
As you work to develop Phase IV legislation to respond to COVID-19
impacts on the U.S. economy, including agriculture, I would like to
encourage you to continue the highly successful Farmers to Families
Food Box Program.
While my bid to participate in round one of the program was not
accepted, I was able to cure the defects in my bid in order for it to
be accepted in the second round. Despite the early setback, I am very
proud to be a part of a program that has provided 41.5 million food
boxes to food banks, community and faith-based organization, and other
nonprofits serving Americans in need. Just last week we packed and
shipped 38,000 20 pound boxes of fruits and vegetables throughout the
Southeast.
Titan Farms primarily grows peaches, bell peppers, and broccoli and
my family and I are truly grateful for the opportunity the Farmers to
Families Food Box Program afforded us to share the bounty of our family
farm with Americans in need during the ongoing pandemic. Healthy diets,
including fruits and vegetables, promote healthy immune systems and
that could not be more important than it is right now.
I hope you will continue to support the Farmers to Families Food
Box Program as part of the nation's COVID-19 relief efforts.
Sincerely,

Chalmers R. Carr III,
President.

Dear Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Conaway:

By way of introduction, my name is Bob Ona, and I serve as the Lead
Pastor of Northview Church in the Fargo/Moorhead area, which are border
cities in North Dakota and Minnesota.
Our church has worked at founding civic activities that benefit our
area, which has resulted in unity events involving community and
municipal organizations that highlight building bridges between local
police forces and ethnic enclaves in various parts of our metroplex.
Typically we work with multiple entities to stage outdoor events with
sound systems and platforms, mass barbecues, games, dunk tanks, prizes,
food distribution and in general create a carnival atmosphere that
builds community esprit de corps.
One result of these events has been the founding of Reach the
Heart, a service minded entity through which we recently distributed
75,000 pounds of food to those in need of our community, all because of
the food provided by Farmers to Families. These events, conducted in
June, went a long way toward promoting community unity at a time when
civil unrest was stirring in our area.
I was pleased that we were able to distribute food to diverse
groups including those who came to the United States from Nepal, Haiti,
Sudan, Ivory Coast, and Bosnia to name a few.
One young man called me to ask if he could help distribute food
even though:

He did not go to my church. Answer: ``Yes''.

He was not a Christian. Answer: ``Yes''.

He was a Muslim. Answer: ``Are you a hungry Muslim?'' We
both laughed and he promised to show up.

One further bright spot is that we linked the food distribution to
the first of several relational events called, ``Selah listening
Circles.'' The object is to bring together those who are considered
minorities so that others can hear their stories and build community.
Our first session went exceptionally well, with more to come.
As a result of the efforts mentioned above, people in smaller
communities have touched base with us in the hopes that we could help
them do similar events in their relatively distant locales. Of course
we would be happy to help if we have the opportunity.
I deeply appreciate how the food box program through Farmers to
Families gave us a mechanism to reach out into our community and build
good will. Hopefully we will be able to repeat the experience and help
others in more remote locations to do more of the same.
Thank you for your leadership.
Sincerely,

Bob Ona, D.Phil.,
Lead Pastor.

Dear Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Conaway:

My name is Calvin Thompson and I serve as the Director of Reach the
Heart Ministries. I also serve as Outreach Pastor with Northview Church
in Fargo, ND.
Northview Church and community is comprised of people from numerous
backgrounds and we have a large number of people from a variety of
different countries who now reside in this area.
Over the last 28 years, I served Northview Church (formerly First
Assembly) as Youth Pastor and have been involved with many community
events that included volunteering in area Middle Schools and High
Schools of the Fargo, ND, West Fargo, ND, and the Moorhead, MN
communities.
When the opportunity was presented to provide families with fresh
produce through this difficult time, it was a nobrainer for me to want
to participate. As we prepared for our first distribution on Saturday
June 13th; we scheduled to distribute boxes of food from 8 a.m. to 2
p.m. Quickly, many volunteers stepped forward to participate. During
the first week we were able to distribute approximately 950 boxes of
food before 1 p.m.
Throughout the morning many people expressed their appreciation for
what we were doing throughout the day. Several of those individuals
were literally on the verge of tears and thankful. It was amazing!
At our second distribution day June 27th; we distributed two semi-
truck loads of produce. Our plan that day was also to distribute from 8
a.m. to 2 p.m. However, by 1 p.m. we had given out almost 1,900 boxes
of food.
That day, I personally had several folks ask how they could be
involved and expressed how much it meant to have us providing so much
food to people needing assistance. Several persons even offered to
deliver boxes of produce to elderly individuals who could not come to
pick up a box. We had already set up though several organizations and
people to do just that.
For many, the pandemic has affected a family's level of income. By
providing numerous families with a box of produce it gave each family a
little extra money to be available for other needs.
Our community, like many other communities during this time has
seen the shutdown of their places of employment. Several individuals
would even get out of their vehicle in order to give me a fist bump or
an elbow hit and to let me know how incredible this gift will be for
their family.
One huge take away from this time was to be able to watch as
volunteers worked so hard; placing a box of produce in a vehicle; and
then taking a moment to offer a word of encouragement to each person.
Several families who were assisting to hand out the boxes, indicated
that they had one of the greatest family experiences by having their
children involved as well.

Knowing that lives were changed and blessed has made this
experience so incredible.

When I was looking for assistance to put this event together,
several very key persons came on board immediately to assist with the
organization and flow of the day. It amazes me how ready people are to
help with an opportunity to bless others.
In doing this event, I knew we would also need a refrigerated truck
in order to keep the produce cool throughout the morning. A local
businessman who owns a produce company provided us with a refrigerator
trailer at no cost for both our events and came by a couple times to
observe. Also, another individual's business provided us with a
forklift to make it easier to lift the pallets of produce out of the
truck.
Finally, here is a message a mom shared on my Facebook page from
her experience that day. She brought her two children with her to
volunteer the entire morning.

``I told my girls that volunteering is like veggies for the
soul and for our community. It may not be something you crave
right away, but the more you do it, the healthier you are, the
more you'll want to do it. AND the ranch you put on it to make
it taste even better are things like your attitude, music,
togetherness, and laughter. I had mixed reviews on my analogy,
but because I'm a good mom (not always a popular mom) I'm happy
to let that marinate. A #eatyourvegqies #bekind''

I have so many other responses I could share if I had the time; but
I want to thank you for making this opportunity a reality for the
community. If other opportunities are provided, I plan to do this event
again and I have been talking with several other Pastors in the state
to see if we could assist them with an opportunity in the future as
well.
Sincerely,

Calvin Thompson,
Director of Reach the Heart,

Dear Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Conaway:

My name is Lori McAfee and I'm the President at Wings As Eagles
Ministries on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, SD. Our ministry is
comprised of three reservations including Pine Ridge Reservation as
well as Rosebud, SD, Northern Arapaho Reservation, WY. It has been an
amazing program to bring much needed fresh food to a forgotten people
group.
The poorest of the poor on these reservations have been excited to
receive fresh fruit and vegetables. The families do not receive fresh
fruit or vegetables even on a good day. One family cried when they
received a box. Two Lakota children from the Pine Ridge Reservation ate
a whole bag of apples!
With gatherings not permitted on the reservations due to an
increase of cases this program has made all the difference to the
people.
We are grateful and thankful for this fresh food program. Many of
the forgotten areas of the country are now receiving quality food.
Sincerely,

Lori McAfee,
Wings As Eagles Ministries.

Submitted Fact Sheet by Hon. K. Michael Conaway, a Representative in
Congress from Texas

Farmers to Families Food Box Program
Claim vs. Fact
July 2020
Claim: The Farmers to Families Food Box Program (FFFBP) was the
victim of a rushed process that included no engagement with current
distributors and nonprofits and resulted in cherry-picked contractors
who were not qualified.
Fact: Utilizing contracting flexibilities provided by Federal
Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 18 during an Emergency Declaration,
the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) designed a process
to rapidly vet and approve contractors to participate in the program.
The vetting process relied upon answers to a Request for Proposals
(RFP). Offerors described the capabilities they had for achieving
performance under the contract.
Demonstrations of this capability included, but were not limited
to, commercial experience; business ethics and integrity standards;
food safety and/or regulatory audits; inspections, certifications and
approvals; and a demonstration of financial capability to perform. USDA
evaluated the offeror's ability to responsibly execute the requirements
of the contract as they pertain to administrative, ethical, safety,
compliance, and financial prowess of the offeror. As part of USDA's
standard internal controls, the acquisition will be reviewed for
compliance to the solicitation and Federal regulations.
Like other Federal contracts administered by USDA, FFFBP and its
awardees require strict adherence to the FAR and other regulations. All
proposals were carefully reviewed by a team of approximately 18
contracting and technical experts, and contracts were made accordingly.
Proposals for the FFFBP were evaluated by (in descending order of
importance) the technical information: past performance of the offeror,
the offeror's capability to perform, and the prices offered. Offerors
must have met all criteria in order to be competitive and must have, or
be able to acquire, a Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA)
license to comply with the contractual requirement. All current
contractors have valid PACA licenses.
Each vendor awarded a contract provided three past performance
references for similar contract/orders completed within the past 3
years (or contracts and orders which were currently being completed).
The amounts and locations awarded were based on the offers received and
the evaluation of those offers.
Claim: There is no accountability in FFFBP.
Fact: USDA provides oversight throughout the contract period,
conducting robust audits to ensure food safety plans are followed, that
only domestic produce is provided, and that quality products are
delivered, among other contract administration matters. Contracts
require suppliers to source food from producers, prepare the boxes of
items identified in their proposal, and deliver the boxes to nonprofit
organizations on a mutually agreeable, recurring schedule while
adhering to food safety protocols. Payment is only made upon the
submission of an invoice documenting evidence of delivery and adherence
to the contractual requirements. In addition, the Contracting Officer
is responsible for monitoring the performance of all contractors. If
there are concerns, contractual remedies may be used, which could
include termination. USDA has chosen to exercise this right in two
situations. As with any new program, evaluations are ongoing to assist
USDA in determining whether any adjustments are needed.
Claim: Increasing the benefits associated with the Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or increasing funding for The
Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) would have been a smarter
policy solution.
Fact: Increases to SNAP or TEFAP are subject to Congressional
action. Unlike these programs, there are no hurdles to households
seeking food from FFFBP. This program provides food to any family in
need regardless of income, employment, immigration status, etc.
Further, in addition to supplying food to families in need, the
program was crafted in response to unprecedented global and domestic
disruption to the food supply chain. FFFBP serves three objectives
unique to the program:

Provides an alternative market for food intended for
restaurants and food service, creating outlets for supply
chains that could not be easily realigned to retail markets
quickly enough to prevent spoilage.

Provides fresh products in greater quantity than suitable
for traditional emergency feeding programs--items such as
dairy, fluid milk and cooked meat--which present unique
logistical challenges for distribution.

Re-employ workers in the commercial food distribution
sector, whose work was idled by the closure of restaurants,
hotels, and other food service businesses.

Claim: Increasing SNAP benefits is the only viable approach to meet
the nutrition needs of Americans.
Fact: The COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented challenges to our
nation's food supply system. Simply providing more money for use in
retail venues, while many retailers were facing historic demand:

Would not have moved excess product that had been intended
for non-retail buyers;

Would not have put Americans to work, and most importantly;

Would not have distributed nutritious and abundant fresh
food to Americans most in need during this crisis.

The pandemic and the FFFBP have made clear that we need to address
food insecurity in creative ways that leverage public and private
capabilities to America's nutrition needs.
Claim: The program only serves limited areas and did not take into
consideration those areas with the most need.
Fact: On July 1, 2020, USDA announced $202 million in new
contracts, via a new acquisition activity, with select vendors whose
offers were not previously accepted due to various minor technical
issues in their proposals. These distributors will help direct food to
under-served areas and will have an increased focus on Opportunity
Zones in order to direct food to reach under-served areas, places where
either no boxes have yet been delivered, or where boxes are being
delivered but where there is additional need. Original RFP offerors do
not need to submit additional or revised information unless asked to do
so by the Contracting Officer.
Claim: USDA fell woefully short of their commitment to deliver 40
million boxes to people in need by June 30, 2020.
Fact: As of July 22, 2020, USDA has invoiced 35.4 million boxes for
the period ending June 30, 2020. While deliveries from the base period
of performance have ceased, AMS continues to receive and process
invoices, leaving the total amount of boxes delivered subject to
change. Critics of the program essentially want to tell you the final
score of the game before it is over!
Additionally, FFFBP has far exceeded USDA's April estimate that the
program would procure $300 million per month in fresh fruits,
vegetables, meat, and dairy. The value of the 35.4 million boxes
invoiced so far in May and June is more than $940 million.
Claim: There are no clear points of contact within the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) to submit complaints or ask questions.
Fact: The FFFBP website via AMS has a specific email address that
allows USDA internal teams to triage inquiries. AMS's contracting team
fields inquiries from recipients and contractors on a regular basis
through this channel.
Claim: USDA has not explained their rationale for the various
regions (e.g., Puerto Rico being part of the Mid-Atlantic Region).
Fact: USDA used the identical regional breakdown used by Food,
Nutrition, and Consumer Services (FNCS). Applying these existing
regional boundaries allowed USDA to quickly delineate areas for local
and regional procurement of food and distribution of boxes--a stated
objective of the program.
Claim: Some contractors fell short of the number of boxes they were
contracted to deliver.
Fact: The following cannot be stressed enough: no vendor is paid
until proof of delivery and compliance with the contract is confirmed.
Contracts included not-to-exceed volumes, but did not stipulate a
minimum performance level, allowing flexibility under changing market
conditions. Fluid milk is a good example of the soundness of this
approach:

Demand and pricing for cheese increased throughout the
contract period;

Milk was directed to the processing of cheese; and

Less fluid milk was available in certain areas as a result.

Therefore, a contract for specific volumes would have
negatively impacted the dairy industry.

Remaining funds not paid against contracts in the first round were
used to augment the program in the second round. Any funds remaining
from the second round will be applied to the new round of vendor
solicitations for deliveries through October, which USDA will announce
shortly.

Submitted Comments by Hon. Glenn Thompson, a Representative in Congress
from Pennsylvania
``These have been great for the families that we are serving
mainly because these are items that with limited incomes most
people aren't able to purchase due to getting other basic foods
that they need. The popularity has been outstanding, the
product has been great, and I only wish I was able to get more.
The food chain per say is still tight in most stores and people
are trying to stretch their dollars as much as they can. I am
getting most of these boxes from the Central PA Food Bank and I
did get some from Ryan Campbell Farms, but not been able to
receive more from them.''
Mel Curtis, YMCA of Centre County, Anti-Hunger Director.
``Fresh produce boxes were received and weighed approximately
20lbs each I and other volunteers were amazed at the variety of
fresh produce. They were amazing. Quality, excellent. No
spoilage that I could see or heard from anyone. Received some
comments second hand that clients were very appreciative and
amazed at the quantity and variety.
One client, no two clients, commented to me directly that
they were going to make homemade vegetable soup. They were
excited actually.
My opinion. To be able to distribute these emergency [boxes]
to each and every client was a `God'send. Both types were well
received and would be great to continue to distribute to all
during these difficult times.''
John, Christian Food Bank of Elk County.
``The USDA Farm[ers] to Families Food Box Program has been a
blessing to the Food for Friends Food Bank in Columbia County,
Pa. The quality of the produce is very good and the variety of
fruits and vegetables is excellent. The people we serve look
forward to receiving the items every other week. I hope the
program is able to continue till the end of the year.''
John Trathen, Food for Friends Food Bank Committee Member.
``We are receiving and distributing dairy boxes and half
gallons of 2% milk from Schneiders' and Turner Dairy. We can
get all the milk we need, but the dairy boxes are limited.
Dairy boxes contain cheese, yogurt, butter, etc., as well as
milk. The boxes are easy to distribute when we have drive-thru
distributions because we can safely load them directly into
clients' trunks. We also receive all the produce boxes we need
that contain potatoes, carrots, cabbage, onions, fruit, etc.
Because these items are already boxed, it is easy for us to
distribute them. The Farm to Families program has enabled us to
distribute healthy food to families in need, and it would be
important to continue it during this pandemic.''
Sister Karen Kosin, Second Harvest Food Bank of NW PA.

Submitted Questions
Responses from Hon. Greg Ibach, Under Secretary, Marketing and
Regulatory Programs, U.S. Department of Agriculture
Questions Submitted by Hon. Marcia L. Fudge, a Representative in
Congress from Ohio
Question 1. For Rounds 1 and 2 of FFFBP, what is USDA doing to
ensure that all the food in the boxes, including processed foods like
cooked chicken and pork and dairy products, can be traced back to
domestic producers?
Answer. USDA provides oversight throughout the contract period,
conducting robust audits to ensure food safety plans are followed, that
only domestic produce is provided, and that quality products are
delivered, among other contract administration matters. Outlined below
and attached is the relevant contract requirements specific to domestic
origin. (See attached domestic origin certification that must be
submitted by all vendors [Attachment 1].
Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) technical staff conduct
reviews of all vendor proposals to assist AMS contracting staff
determine vendor eligibility for the Base and Option 1 food box
purchases, including confirmation of domestic origin of product
provided.
Agency technical experts also complete vendor verification reviews
and audits, including domestic origin in support of the USDA Farmers to
Families Food Box Program (FFFBP). Additional information about the AMS
Domestic Origin Verification (DOV) program can be found at
www.ams.usda.gov.
Contracting staff is responsible for monitoring the performance of
all contractors. If there are concerns, contractual remedies may be
used, which could include termination.

Question 1a. Has USDA confirmed that all contractors, including
those with little to no experience in food distribution, have the
necessary documentation describing where they sourced their food? Has
USDA paid any contractors without confirming such documentation?
Answer. USDA provides oversight throughout the contract period,
conducting robust audits to ensure food safety plans are followed, that
only domestic produce is provided, and that quality products are
delivered, among other contract administration matters. Contracts
require suppliers to source food from producers, prepare the boxes of
items identified in their proposal, and deliver the boxes to nonprofit
organizations on a mutually agreeable, recurring schedule, while
adhering to the high USDA food safety protocols. Payment will be made
upon the submission of an invoice documenting evidence of delivery and
adherence to the contractual requirements. The Federal Acquisition
Regulation Part 49 provides guidance regarding termination of Federal
contracts, including contracts approved for the FFFBP.
As part of their proposal, offerors described their capabilities
for achieving performance under the contract. Demonstrations of this
capability included but were not limited to: commercial experience;
business ethics and integrity standards; food safety and/or regulatory
audits; inspections; certifications and approvals; and a demonstration
of financial capability to perform. USDA evaluated the offeror's
ability to responsibly execute the requirements of the contract as they
pertain to administrative, ethical, safety, compliance, and financial
prowess of the offeror.
As part of the technical review prior to contract award, USDA
contracting staff reviewed subcontracting plans of all suppliers. In
addition, during the execution of the food box program, desk audits.
and in some cases when safety allows it, on-site audits are being
conducted to verify contracting terms are being met.

Question 2. Please provide the number of individuals at USDA, as
well as the number of FTEs, ensuring that the FFFBP contractors are in
compliance with the terms of the contracts in Rounds 1 and 2. Please
provide the job title for each individual and describe the
responsibilities for each individual, as it relates to ensuring
compliance with the Food Box contract.
Answer. USDA has designated a team of specialists and contracting
officers to assist in the administration of the FFFBP purchases.
Purchases were awarded by region. There are eight regions covering the
country and territories including one designated as multi-regional.
Each region has a specialist assigned to it to assist with questions,
logistics and to monitor pricing and payments.
The USDA team is being led by a GS15 Agricultural Marketing
Specialist (Division Director) responsible for overall team planning
and project execution. Contracting activity was led by a GS14
Contracting Officer (CO) responsible for development of the purchase
strategy, solicitation design and submission review, contract award and
compliance supported by a team of contract specialists. In addition,
the team consists of five 1102's at the GS12 level and two 1146's, one
at the GS12 and the other at the GS11 level. 1102's are Contract
Specialists and 1146's are Agricultural Marketing Specialists.
The contracting team is being assisted by a group of four from
across the Agency with expertise to review proposal submissions for
technical sufficiency and to conduct food safety and Domestic Origin
Verification audits.
A team from the Web Based Supply Chain Management (WBSCM) group and
data analytics assisted in contractor training and report development.
A GS13 Program Analyst, and two GS12 Agricultural Marketing Specialists
assisted in these activities.

Question 3. During the hearing, I had requested a list of all the
nonprofits receiving food boxes from FFFBP contractors in Rounds 1 and
2.
Please provide a list of those nonprofits, as well as any
governmental entities, the address of each entity, and how many boxes
each entity received.
Answer. Yes, we are providing a list of entities receiving boxes,
[see Attachment 2]. We are not capturing addresses and box counts.

Question 4. Just 3 days after the hearing, USDA announced a third
round of FFFBP contracts and significant changes to the Program in the
third round.
Why did USDA decide not to extend any of the existing contracts
into Round 3?
Answer. On August 25, 2020, USDA announced it has begun issuing
agreements for distribution of Food Boxes in the upcoming third round
of solicitations. Issuing new agreements for distribution in the in the
third round using Basic Ordering Agreements (BOA) gives USDA greater
flexibility to ensure contracted entities provide adequate coverage
throughout the states and territories. In addition, the new agreements
incorporate feedback received during the first two rounds, including
placing more emphasis on food insecurity by seeking entities that
provide combination boxes and requiring distributors to illustrate how
they will provide coverage to areas identified as opportunity zones,
detail subcontracting agreements, and address the ``last mile''
delivery of product into the hands of the food-insecure population.

Question 4a. The solicitation for the third round notes that
offerors ``must self-certify that nonprofits have the capability to
ensure that only needy people, or the food-insecure population, will
receive the food boxes,'' and that the offerors must address their
ability to ensure this requirement is enforced and validated. Please
explain in detail what information USDA would consider sufficient to
demonstrate the nonprofit's capability and how it expects offerors to
enforce and validate the requirement.
Answer. An offeror's nonprofit partners must comply with AMS Doc.
No. AMS-CP-20-0040. An offeror must self-certify that their nonprofit
partner has the capability to ensure that only needy people, or the
food-insecure population, will receive the food boxes through this
Program. As part of the BOA proposal submission narrative, offerors
shall address their ability to ensure that the aforementioned
requirements are enforced and validated. The offeror is also required
to affirm this via the Section E.2, BOA Submission Spreadsheet tab
B.4.a-d `Required Performance Elements/Affirmation.' USDA contracting
staff is responsible for monitoring the performance of all contractors.
If there are concerns, contractual remedies may be used, which could
include termination.

Question 5. The Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) is the
Federal Government's central database of information on Federal
procurement actions. Federal regulations require Federal agencies to
report procurement actions, such as FFFBP contract awards, to FPDS.
Can USDA please explain the numerous inconsistencies between the
list of contractors posted on USDA's FFFBP website and the information
in FPDS, and commit to ensuring that the correct information is posted
on both websites? For example, USDA's website shows that Borden Dairy
Co. was awarded a contract of $146.9 million in the first round. FPDS
shows that Borden Dairy Co. was awarded a contract of $36.7 million in
the first round and had its contract extended for $36.16 million in the
second round.
Answer. Awards were based on contractors stated ability to deliver
specific amounts of food boxes. Upon award and based on discussions
with offerors, it was occasionally decided that a different amount of
boxes were going to be delivered for various reasons, thus the
discrepancy. Contracts were awarded on a ``Not to Exceed'' basis. The
AMS website shows the NTE and FPDS is the actual amount the contractor
agrees to deliver. Contractors are only paid for what they deliver.

Question 6. Please describe in detail the economic analysis used by
USDA to determine purchases in the Trade Mitigation Food Purchase and
Distribution Program.
For example, how does that economic analysis justify USDA's
purchase of canned vegetable soups, such as cream of mushroom soup, for
the Trade Mitigation Food Purchase and Distribution Program?
Answer. An economic assessment of trade damage conducted by USDA's
Office of the Chief Economist identified a variety of processed foods
negatively impacted by retaliatory tariffs. These processed food
products included tomato sauces, canned tomatoes, pasta, prepared
cereals, soups/broths, and other food products commonly purchased for
USDA feeding programs. A link to the reports that outline the
methodology used to estimate trade damages can be found here:

Question 7. On July 30th, the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS)
announced a nearly $1 million award under the Healthy Fluid Milk
Incentive (HFMI) Project to the Baylor University Collaborative on
Hunger and Poverty. This is in addition to FNS's September 2019 grant
of $5 million to Baylor University and FNS's March 2020 collaboration
with Baylor University to deliver food boxes to children.
How many other entities submitted applications for an HFMI award?
Question 7a. Can USDA provide the points awarded for each submitted
HFMI application, broken down by evaluation factor?
Question 7b. How much funding has Baylor University received from
FNS for each of Fiscal Years 2009 through 2020?
Answer 7-7b. The information requested is outside the purview of
the Marketing and Regulatory Programs Mission Area. As such, we cannot
offer further insight, and would respectfully encourage the
Representative to engaged directly with the Food and Nutrition Service.
Questions Submitted by Hon. Jimmy Panetta, a Representative in Congress
from California
Question 1. My food bank in Monterey County is receiving dairy and
produce boxes from the Central Valley. They are partnering with some
wonderful distributors, but I have asked myself, why is a food bank in
the Salad Bowl of the World receiving produce from a different region?
From conversations with the California Association of Food Banks, I
understand that this example is a microcosm of what is happening up and
down the state.
In agricultural hubs like my district, what is USDA doing to ensure
local produce reaches local food banks and nonprofits?
Answer. For Round 3 solicitations, USDA is requiring offerors to
include a written narrative describing their role in support of
American agriculture. The offeror should address how their
participation supports the mission of facilitating agricultural
markets. The offeror should also describe how they intend to engage
small farmers (e.g., those farms servicing local and regional interests
and farmers markets). If this is not addressed, USDA will not consider
the proposal. USDA is specifying that one or two locally grown fruit or
vegetable items, as available, be included in the produce and
combination box.

Question 2. From stories I have heard from my food banks, I am
aware that some of the food boxes are full of nutritious fruits and
vegetables or dairy products, while others are less than ideal--maybe
some onions and carrots.
Is every food box supposed to be equal to another in the same
category?
Answer. USDA understands that the value of a food box will depend
on the product it contains. However, USDA has attempted to provide
equal volume of food by requiring about 15-20 pounds each of produce,
meat and dairy in individual boxes and the combination box.

Question 2a. What are you doing to ensure the nutritional value of
food boxes?
Answer. A primary driver of the emphasis on combination boxes for
the next round of solicitations is the need to provide a nutritionally
balanced food box. USDA has specified a certain amount of food in each
category of product as illustrated in the excerpted solicitation
language below.

[b.] Contents of boxes are limited to the items described
herein.
c. Boxes with a net weight ranging from 30-40 lbs are
required.
d. Boxes must contain, at a minimum;

1) Fresh Fruit and vegetable (F&V) content:

i. 2-4 lbs. of root vegetables such as
potatoes, yams, carrots, onions, etc.
ii. 2-4 lbs. of fruits with longer storage
life such as stone fruits, citrus, apples, or
melons.
iii. 1 or 2 locally grown fruit or vegetable
items, as available, and if none available, add
additional items of vendors choice or increase
the fruit or vegetables to meet a minimum F&V
weight range of 10 to 12lbs.

2) Dairy content:

i. 5-6 lbs of at least 2 dairy items
including at least one from group A and one
from group B plus the equivalent of 1 gal of
milk (2 percent or whole)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Group A                              Group B
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cheddar Cheese                       Cottage Cheese
Swiss Cheese                         Cream Cheese
Pepperjack Cheese                    Yogurt
Mozzarella Cheese                    Butter
Sour Cream
------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) Meat and Egg or Egg Products (meat must be pre-
cooked) content:

i. 5-6 lbs of at least 2 pre-cooked frozen or
refrigerated meat items. No more than 1 lb. of
lunch meat item is permitted.

4) Meat and dairy must have combined weight of at
least 10 lbs
5) Fluid milk or other temperature sensitive items
may be provided either physically in the box or
provided simultaneously with the other box contents
(for the purposes of delivery confirmation and
invoicing, all the required components are considered a
single box, even if delivered simultaneously outside
the box). All the materials specified above must be
given simultaneously to an end-user. The contractor is
responsible for ensuring appropriate packaging[ . . . ]

* Editor's note: the excerpt is from Combined Synopsis/
Solicitation--12-3J14-20-B-0588--Families to Farmers Food Boxes and is
available at: https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/
FFFB_solicitationRound3.pdf.

Question 2b. Why have frozen fruits and vegetables, which are often
harvested from the same fields as fresh produce and have the same
nutritional content, excluded from this program? Does USDA plan to
incorporate these products into the Farmers to Families Food Box
Program in the future?
Answer. At the time of program development, the fresh produce,
dairy, chicken and pork industries were negatively impacted by COVID-19
and subsequently selected as the product categories for the program.
Fresh produce farmers in particular were impacted as product was being
left in the field to rot as distributors lost their traditional
restaurant and hotel business.
Other USDA purchase programs outside of the Farmers to Families
Food Box Program are having a positive impact on the frozen produce
industry. USDA purchases a significant amount of frozen product each
year with Section 32 and other funds for distribution to food banks and
other outlets.

Question 3. When contracts are canceled for various reasons, is the
money allocated to that contract reallocated to distributors in the
same region? For example, if a contract in California was canceled, is
the unspent money reallocated to another distributor in the Western
Region?
Answer. USDA collects and displays in map, chart and other formats
data illustrating coverage of the box program. USDA knows at any time
how many boxes, what kind of boxes, and the value of boxes delivered to
each state and territory. Utilizing this data as well as continual
feedback from governmental entities, industry groups as well as
nonprofit organizations, USDA is continuing to develop plans and
execute contracts to help better serve under-served areas. For example,
to date, 16 contractors have been added to the program and have
delivered an extra 2.849 million boxes to under-served areas such as
Maine, Alaska and North Dakota that had previously received few or
none. There are currently 20 contractors serving CA alone with others
covering the rest of the West Coast.
Questions Submitted by Hon. Chellie Pingree, a Representative in
Congress from Maine
Question 1. Many food banks have existing relationships with local
farmers. In Maine, some food pantries have gone from having no fresh
produce to an oversupply, as boxes arrive at the same time as product
from local farmers.
What changes will you make in the next round of the program to
ensure that the food boxes are better complementing these existing
partnerships?
Answer. For the third round of solicitations the Department has
made a decision to refine the program to include more of an emphasis on
food insecurity and nutrition and less on surplus removal. The delivery
record of almost 70 million boxes as of Aug. 21 in the first two rounds
of solicitations is a testament to the strength of the existing network
of contractor and nonprofit relationships. However, to further
strengthen this network USDA is expecting offerors to have a more
robust relationship established with nonprofit recipients. Offerors
must provide a written and signed agreement between themselves and the
nonprofit (if a subcontracted nonprofit is part of the offerors supply
chain). At a minimum, the agreement must confirm that a mutually agreed
to delivery schedule and approach have been agreed upon. The agreement
must explain how the two parties intend to ensure last mile delivery
and to avoid delivering product that may not be needed.
Offerors are required to identify and explain the distribution plan
for their food boxes; this would include the scope and extent of
subcontracts (including any potential nonprofit agreements). The prime
contractor is solely responsible for ensuring truck to trunk model,
last mile delivery and aspects pertaining to means testing.

Question 2. The Farmers to Families Food Box Program was intended
to divert food that would otherwise be wasted due to supply chain
disruptions and processing bottlenecks to families in need. However, it
doesn't seem that USDA has a mechanism to help distributors identify
this soon-to-be wasted food, or to assist farmers with excess supply in
finding a contracted distributor.
Did USDA provide any guidance to approved contractors on the
products they should purchase in order to minimize food waste? If not,
why not?
Answer. During the planning stages of the food box program, USDA
staff consulted with numerous trade associations, companies and other
stakeholder groups to identify agricultural products that were in
oversupply due to supply chain disruptions. As a result, requirements
were developed for boxes to contain a variety of fruits and vegetables,
milk, other dairy products, pork and chicken.

Question 2a. If a farmer has excess product, who should they
contact at USDA to be matched with a buyer for this program?
Answer. USDA has posted a complete list of contractors to its
website to enable farmers to reach out to establish business
connections.

Question 3. Food bank representatives testified at the hearing that
some of the boxes were assembled in ways that contributed to food
waste. For example, onions packed with melons resulted in the contents
of the boxes quickly rotting.
What new guidance will you provide to contractors in the next round
to ensure that the food purchased for this program is not wasted?
Answer. Recipient organizations have been instructed to not accept
delivery of boxes containing product of low quality. USDA contracting
staff occasionally receive complaints and immediately follow up with
the contractor to remedy the situation.
In addition, the government reserves the right to perform quality
assurance at source; source includes, but is not limited to,
contractor's manufacturing facility, packaging facility, warehouse, in-
house laboratory, subcontractor's facilities, etc. USDA has exercised
this right in a number of situations to ensure the quality of boxes
being provided through the program.

Question 4. You mentioned that USDA collects data on the nonprofits
that receive the food boxes but does not currently provide this data
publicly.
If a family in need would like to receive a food box, how should
they find which nonprofits are distributing them in their community?
Answer. USDA maintains a list of nonprofit recipients to facilitate
confirmation of delivery. At this time, USDA does not have a matching
mechanism for individual recipients to find details about food box
distribution events. Since contractors have the most readily available
schedule and nonprofit contact, recipients are being directed to the
list on our website.

Question 5. You testified at the hearing that USDA had not rejected
any invoices for food boxes provided under this program.
How many invoices has USDA now received to date? How many have been
paid? How many have been rejected?
Answer. As of August 21, USDA has received 105,925 invoices for
payment. A little over 730 have been rejected for further review for a
variety of reasons, including incomplete supporting documentation.
Payment will be made only upon the submission of an invoice documenting
evidence of delivery and adherence to the contractual requirements.
Question Submitted by Hon. Jim Hagedorn, a Representative in Congress
from Minnesota
Question. Under Secretary Ibach, thank you for spending time with
the Committee last week in defense of the Farmers to Families Food Box
Program. While MN and my district have benefitted from the program, our
dairy processing industry has faced some issues with procuring raw
materials. It seems there is an unintended consequence to the surge of
cheddar and mozzarella purchases by USDA. The milk market itself, which
cheese companies in my district rely on to plan, has seen unprecedented
swings in pricing over the past 3 months. An example, block cheddar
went from a low in April of $1.00 to an all-time high of $3.00 in July.
The last time there was a spike like that was in 2014, and July's price
is 22% higher than 2014. On the flip side, there are other cheeses such
as swiss, jack cheese, and aged cheeses that are in oversupply.
Would USDA consider diversifying their cheese purchases in upcoming
solicitations to give the market time to correct itself?
Answer. Yes, USDA has expanded the allowable cheese products in the
food box for Round 3 solicitations given ever evolving market
developments to include . . .

Dairy Box:

1. 8-12 lbs. of at least 2 dairy items including at
least one from group A and one from group B plus the
equivalent of 1-2 gallons, of milk (2 percent or whole)
2. Total Box Weight including Fluid Milk must be
between 17-21 lbs.

Trade Damage Estimation for the Market Facilitation Program and Food
Purchase and Distribution Program

U.S. Department of Agriculture, Office of the Chief Economist
September 13, 2018
Executive Summary
This paper outlines the methodology USDA employed to estimate the
level of gross trade damage caused by retaliatory tariffs to U.S.
agricultural exports by commodity. Those estimates were used to
determine the Market Facilitation Program (MFP) payment rates and the
value of commodities to be purchased under the Food Purchase and
Distribution Program (FPDP). USDA announced (https://www.usda.gov/
media/press-releases/2018/07/24/usda-assists-farmers-impacted-
unjustified-retaliation) these two programs as part of a trade
mitigation package on July 24, 2018. For more details about the trade
mitigation programs, visit https://www.farmers.gov/.
Rulemaking and related documents, including the Cost Benefit
Analysis (CBA), for the Market Facilitation Program can be found at

Trade Damage Estimation for the Market Facilitation Program and Food
Purchase and Distribution Program
USDA developed an estimate of gross trade damages to set commodity
payment rates and purchase levels for the trade mitigation package
announced on July 24, 2018.\1\ This is the approach often employed in
adjudicating trade dispute cases. For example, in the U.S.-Country of
Origin Labeling dispute case, World Trade Organization (WTO)
arbitrators awarded trade damages of approximately $1 billion to Canada
and Mexico based on the gross trade value of their lost livestock
exports to the United States due to the COOL measure.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ See announcement at https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/
2018/09/04/usda-launches-trade-mitigationprograms.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following explanation describes the steps taken to calculate
the trade damage estimates for the 2018 retaliatory tariffs by Canada,
China, the European Union (EU), Mexico, and Turkey (for a more detailed
discussion of the model equations, see Annex 1).

Step 1: Trade value without the retaliatory tariff from a
particular country (Exports1).

Step 2: Trade value with the retaliatory tariff from a
particular country (Exports2).

Step 3: Take the difference of the two as the ``trade
damage'' due to the tariff (Delta).\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ This definition also follows the trade damage formula that
would be theoretically consistent to the interpretation of the WTO
principle of reciprocity. See Bown, Chad P., and Michele Ruta. ``The
economics of permissible WTO retaliation.'' The Law, Economics and
Politics of Retaliation in WTO Dispute Settlement 3 (2010): 149.

This is illustrated in Figure 1 below, where gross trade damages is
measured as Delta = Exports1^Exports2.
Figure 1: Value of U.S. exports to retaliatory partner with and without
the retaliatory tariff

For Step 1, we use actual trade in 2017 as a proxy for the expected
value of trade without the retaliatory tariff (or Exports1) using
import data from Canada, China, the EU, Mexico, and Turkey.
From above, we cannot observe the Delta from trade data yet.
Typically, a WTO dispute is filed, and time lapses and allows the
observation of lower trade following a disputed measure, but
implementing a timely program to respond to retaliatory tariffs did not
allow for multi-year data collection. Therefore, for Step 2, we use a
global trade model to estimate what the value of trade is expected to
be after the imposition ofthe tariffs (or Exports2).
The model estimates bilateral trade flows for each of the
commodities with assessed tariffs. As a general rule, a given tariff
will increase the cost of that commodity in the importing country,
leading to lower demand for the commodity from the exporting country.
This method reflects the level of the tariffs and the sensitivity of
the retaliatory partner's import demand to the higher prices caused by
the additional tariff. Availability of substitute suppliers on the one
hand (for the retaliating importer) and substitute demanders on the
other hand (for the U.S. exporter) are also reflected in this approach.
Subtracting Step (1) from Step (2) provides a measure of gross
trade damage. Note, the gross trade damage only reflects direct export
losses due to the retaliatory tariff imposed on the U.S. commodity.
Indirect or secondary effects from the tariff, such as cross-commodity
effects are not reflected in the gross trade damage estimate.
The Food Purchase and Distribution Program's announced purchase
values were set at the same level of gross trade damage to each
affected commodity, using the trade model outlined above and reflecting
the amount of commodity surplus resulting from the gross trade losses.
In determining the amount of assistance that USDA would make
available to producers to facilitate marketing of crops affected by
these retaliatory tariffs and to assist in the development of
alternative markets under the Market Facilitation Program (MFP), USDA
divided that estimated trade damage level by 2017 crop year production
to calculate a per unit rate. We used 2017 trade and production data
because 2018 data are not final and are months away from being
complete. Moreover, the 2018 trade data will show a biased impact
because of the tariffs. Because the goal of the MFP is to provide
assistance to producers of commodities that have been significantly
impacted by the retaliatory tariffs, the MFP per unit rate is applied
to a producer's actual 2018 production levels to generate a producer's
total payment amount.
The retaliatory tariffs may be removed at some point through trade
negotiations and other factors may occur that ultimately help mitigate
the trade damage to U.S. producers, creating the need for an interim
step to calculate payments. That interim step led USDA, in consultation
with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and other White House
offices, to split a producer's 2018 production into two parts. The
first part was announced on September 4th and payment calculation
follow the steps above. The second part will be announced, if
necessary, in December and may account for other factors, such as new
tariff levels, regional basis effects, or other market conditions that
may have mitigated some of the trade damages calculated above.
MFP example 1: Sorghum
Step 1: In 2017, China imported $956 million of sorghum from the
United States.
Step 2: With additional 25% tariff, China is estimated to import
$642 million from the United States.
Step 3: Estimated gross trade damage = $642 million^$956 million =
^$314 million Initial MFP rate = $314 million/364 million bushels =
$0.86/bu.
MFP example 2: Corn
Step 1: In 2017, China and EU combined imported $309 million of
corn from the United States.
Step 2: With additional 25% tariff from both countries, the
combined imports from the United States is estimated to be $117
million.
Step 3: Estimated gross trade damage = $117 million^$309 million =
^$192 million.
Initial MFP rate = $192 million/14.6 billion bushels = $0.01/bu.
Annex 1: Trade Model Formulas
USDA estimated the impacts of retaliatory tariffs using a version
of the Global Simulation Model (GSIM). GSIM is a standard Armington
partial equilibrium model of trade developed by Francois and Hall
(2009).\3\ The model assumes that products are differentiated by
country, and permits the assessment of tariff changes at the product
level. Global bilateral trade flows are modeled according to basic
supply and demand relationships, given an initial equilibrium in a base
year. The model solves for a new market equilibrium following the
imposition of the retaliatory tariff, where prices clear excess supply
and demand conditions to adjust to changes in global bilateral trade
flows.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ Francois, Joseph, and H. Keith Hall. Global simulation analysis
of industry-level trade policy: The GSIM model. Institute for
International and Development Economics, 2009.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The model calculates the expected effect on imports of U.S.
products by retaliating trading partners. For example, lost U.S.
exports to China due to a retaliatory tariff imposed on product i is
calculated as

In the model, M
i,(U.S.,CHN)
is set to actual import
levels in the base year where the market is assumed to be in
equilibrium; that amount is taken as the level of imports without the
retaliatory tariff. Given a tariff, the model simulates a new global
equilibrium, where Mt
i,(U.S.,CHN)
is the expected level of
Chinese imports of product i from the United States with the
retaliatory tariff.
GSIM is a global model and includes bilateral import demand
equations for multiple countries/regions. In the model, Chinese import
demand of product i from the U.S. with the retaliatory tariff would be
represented as follows:

Where:

t
i,(U.S.,CHN)
is China's additional retaliatory
tariff on U.S. product i.

P
*

i,(U.S.)
is the U.S. export price
for product i and is normalized to one in the initial
equilibrium without the tariff. Given the retaliatory tariff,
prices are solved iteratively in the model to clear global
supply and demand.

s is the constant elasticity of substitution for product i.
These are sourced from GTAP and Virginia Tech.

a
i,(U.S.,CHN)
is a preference parameter that is
calibrated in the model to match the initial equilibrium.

P
i,(CHN)
is the composite price in China for
product i. It represents the overall prices faced by Chinese
consumers. Given a retaliatory tariff, prices adjust not only
for U.S. exports but for all modeled countries. These new
prices are solved iteratively in the model.

E
i,(CHN)
is China's total expenditure on product
i, under the new equilibrium with the retaliatory tariff. It is
calibrated to match expenditures in the initial equilibrium.
Et
i,CHN
also depends upon the composite price index
P
i,(CHN)
and the composite demand elasticity and is
solved under the new equilibrium.

The above equation is solved in a full system of equations modeling
global trade that includes bilateral import demand functions of all
countries/regions in the model along with supply functions. An
iterative algorithm is used to find the set of prices that ensures that
total quantity demanded equals total quantity supplied in all markets
simultaneously. Once the price vector is solved, the expected change in
bilateral trade flows resulting from the tariff is calculated.
The model is calibrated using 2016 data and employs 2017 trade data
for the base year. Trade damages are calculated by the following
formula.

Integrated Trade Solution (https://wits.worldbank.org/) and

Trade Damage Estimation for the 2019 Market Facilitation Program and
Food Purchase and Distribution Program

U.S. Department of Agriculture, Office of the Chief Economist
August 22, 2019
Executive Summary
This paper outlines the methodology USDA employed to estimate the
level of gross trade damage caused by retaliatory tariffs to U.S.
agricultural exports by commodity. Those estimates were used to
determine the 2019 Market Facilitation Program (MFP) payment rates and
the value of commodities to be targeted for purchase under the 2019
Food Purchase and Distribution Program (FPDP). The paper also outlines
the formulas employed to calculate MFP county rates for non-specialty
crops, as well as national MFP rates for specialty crops, hogs, and
milk. USDA announced details on those programs on July 25, 2019. For
more details about the trade mitigation programs, visit https://
www.farmers.gov/manage/mfp. Rulemaking and related documents, including
the Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA), for trade mitigation programs can be
found at https://www.regulations.gov/docket?D=CCC-2019-0003.
Trade Damage Estimation for the 2019 Market Facilitation Program (MFP)
and Purchase Targets for the Food Purchase and Distribution
Program (FPDP)
On May 23, 2019, the Secretary of Agriculture announced (https://
www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2019/05/23/usda-announces-support-
farmers-impacted-unjustified-retaliation-and) that USDA would take
several actions to assist farmers in response to continued retaliation
and trade disruption. President Trump authorized USDA to provide up to
$16 billion in programs, in line with the estimated impacts of
retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural producers and other trade
disruptions. Further details of the 2019 trade mitigation program were
announced (https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2019/07/25/usda-
announces-details-support-package-farmers) on July 25, 2019.
In 2018, USDA developed an estimate of gross trade damages for U.S.
commodities affected by retaliatory tariffs to establish commodity
payment rates for the Market Facilitation Program (MFP) and purchase
targets for the Food Purchase and Distribution Program (FPDP). On
September 13, 2018, USDA provided a detailed accounting of how those
gross damage estimates were calculated.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ For details see: https://www.usda.gov/oce/trade/
USDA_Trade_Methodology_Report.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the 2018 and the 2019 trade mitigation programs, USDA defined
economic losses due to the trade actions in terms of gross trade
damages. Gross trade damages were defined as the total amount of
expected export sales lost to the retaliatory partner due to the
additional tariffs. This metric provides one assessment of economic
loss, and there are other forms of economic injury that could be
measured. Gross trade damage contributes to the economic cost to the
producer to adjust to the disrupted markets, manage surplus
commodities, and expand and develop new markets, consistent with the
design of the MFP. Further, export sale losses provide the most direct
link to the retaliatory action(s) and is the single estimate that most
comprehensively accounts for the full scale of trade impacts. In part
due to these reasons, it is often employed in World Trade Organization
(WTO) arbitrations assessing the level of nullification or impairment
resulting from a measure found to be WTO-inconsistent and is the
approach applied here.
For the 2019 program, USDA employed the same methodology to
estimate gross trade damages, using the same trade model (Global
Simulation Analysis of Industry-Level Trade Policy) documented in 2018.
That model simulates the expected reduction in U.S. exports to the
retaliatory partner market. Gross trade damages are calculated as the
difference in bilateral trade with the tariff and the baseline (without
the tariff).
As with the 2018 trade mitigation programs, the gross trade damage
estimate is the basis for developing the 2019 MFP payment rates, which
are detailed in this paper, as well as FPDP purchase targets. The 2019
programs are designed to aid producers in the disposition of surplus
commodities; to aid in the expansion of domestic markets; or to aid in
the development of new and additional markets and uses. Those programs
are intended for crops or commodities that are negatively impacted by
trade actions of foreign governments. Specifically, the 2019 MFP
payments may provide producers with an opportunity to adjust to delays
in the marketing of their crops and to costs associated with
reorienting their sales to new and additional markets.
Changes in Retaliatory Tariffs
The gross trade damage estimate for 2019 takes into account changes
in retaliatory tariffs since the original damage estimate used for the
2018 trade mitigation programs. There have been five changes to the
retaliatory tariffs applied to U.S. agricultural products since the
2018 damages were calculated:

(a)  On September 24, 2018, China imposed additional tariffs ranging
from five to ten percent on U.S. goods, which were applied
to $3 billion of agricultural products not previously
impacted by China's retaliatory tariffs. Given the timing
of China's action, these tariffs were not included in the
trade damage analysis for the 2018 trade mitigation
programs.

(b)  On May 17, 2019, Mexico and Canada agreed to lift all
retaliatory tariffs related to the U.S.-imposed Section 232
steel and aluminum tariffs. These tariffs covered a broad
range of agricultural and food products, including U.S.
pork and dairy.

(c)  On May 21, 2019, Turkey reduced retaliatory tariffs assessed on
U.S. products by half in response to changes in U.S.-
imposed Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum from
Turkey. Turkey's retaliatory tariffs include some U.S. tree
nuts and rice.

(d)  On June 1, 2019, China increased retaliatory tariffs assessed on
the U.S. on almost $2 billion of agricultural goods by an
additional five to 15 percent. This new list includes many
U.S. horticultural and specialty products.

(e)  On June 16, 2019, India imposed retaliatory tariffs ranging from
2 to 25 percent on U.S. apples, rice, almonds, chickpeas,
and other commodities. India had announced retaliatory
tariffs on U.S. goods in July 2018 but delayed
implementation until June 2019.

The model commodity coverage was expanded to include the broader
range of U.S. agricultural products affected by retaliation, as well as
the increase in (China) or implementation of (India) retaliatory
tariffs. The model scenarios were also revised to remove the
retaliatory tariffs that Canada and Mexico lifted, as well as the
reduction in Turkey's tariffs.
Base Year Changes Account for Long-Standing Distortionary Policies and
Longer-Term Impacts
For the 2018 trade mitigation programs, USDA employed 2017 trade
data as the base year for projecting trade damages. 2017 was used as
the 2018 programs' base year because it was the most recent full year
of trade data available and reflected trade levels prior to the
imposition of retaliatory tariffs starting in April 2018 for some
agricultural products.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ In April 2018, China was the first trading partner to impose
retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agriculture in response to Section 232
tariffs on aluminum and steel. Nearly all retaliatory tariffs--
including those imposed by China in response to actions under Section
301 and Section 232, as well as those imposed by the EU, Canada,
Mexico, and Turkey in response to actions under Section 232, were in
place by July 2018. India was the only country that announced but did
not immediately apply retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products
in 2018.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the 2019 trade mitigation programs, USDA employed a longer
time-series to estimate gross trade damages, by surveying trends in
U.S. bilateral trade over a 10 year period (2009-2018). For some of the
commodities affected by tariffs, 2017 was not the most representative
base year on which to conduct the trade damage analysis. The 10 year
period for determining a basis for the evaluating the tariff allows
estimates to account for other contributing variables, such as
longstanding trade barriers imposed by China and other countries that
have affected U.S. exports, as well as the longer-term impact of
prolonged retaliatory tariffs.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ To be clear, the model estimates the impact of the retaliatory
tariff(s) on a given commodity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
We included 2018 in this time-series, given that for some
commodities, new market access had only just begun prior to the
implementation of retaliatory tariffs. For example, in mid-2017, China
and the United States agreed to improve market access for U.S. beef
exports to China.\4\ U.S. beef exports began to increase in late 2017
through the first half of 2018 before declining and leveling-off. U.S.
beef had been banned from China since 2003, and prior to that ban, the
United States was the country's largest beef supplier. Therefore, it is
reasonable to expect that, but for the retaliatory tariffs that China
imposed on U.S. beef in July 2018, U.S. beef exports to China would
have continued to increase at a similar (if not higher) level as
observed in the first half of 2018. Using 2017 as a base year does not
fully capture the new market access opportunities for U.S. beef.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\4\ On June 12, 2017, USDA announced that it had reached an
agreement with Chinese officials on the final details of a protocol to
allow the United States to begin exporting beef to China. See https://
www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2017/06/12/us-china-finalize-details-
send-us-beef-china.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Other commodities have faced multi-year market access barriers into
China and other countries that have implemented retaliatory tariffs. In
recent years, unwarranted regulatory and trade-distorting measures have
hindered U.S. corn exports to some of these markets, making the 2017
base year less representative of U.S. export levels.\5\ Moreover,
products made from corn, such as distillers dried grains and solubles
(DDGS) and ethanol have been adversely impacted by China's earlier
decisions to unilaterally increase tariffs (ethanol) and impose anti-
dumping and countervailing duties (DDGS).\6\ Other products facing
multi-year market access barriers include poultry, rice, and wheat.

2019 MFP Payments and Payment Rates for Non-Specialty Crops
Given the timing of the 2019 Market Facilitation Program (MFP)
during the crop year, USDA developed a single rate per acre in each
county for MFP-eligible non-specialty crops, which include select non-
specialty commodities both directly and indirectly affected by the
trade dispute, in order to minimize potential distortions.
Payments to each producer are limited to:

2018 Farm Service Agency-certified planted acres;

2018 Farm Service Agency-certified prevented from planting
acres (of non-specialty crops); and

2018 expiring Conservation Reserve Program acreage.

The specific commodity rates that form the basis of the county rate
are derived from the gross trade damage estimates. Commodity rates are
set as the estimated trade damages divided by the average volume of
production for 2015-17 reported by NASS.
The county payment rates \7\ were based on historical fixed average
area and yields as discussed below. The total potential payment amount
for non-specialty crops is the eligible area multiplied by the non-
specialty county rate per acre. This total payment amount is subject to
limitations further discussed under the ``Total MFP Payments'' heading,
beginning on page 7 of the report.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\7\ See https://www.farmers.gov/manage/mfp for rates by county.

Example of non-specialty crop county rate calculation
County A has planted an average of 20,000 acres of corn, 10,000
acres of soybeans, and 1,000 acres of barley. The historical average
county yield is 180 bu/acre for corn, 60 bu/acre for soybeans, and 50
bu/acre for barley. The commodity rates under the 2019 MFP for corn and
soybeans are $0.14/bu and $2.05/bu, respectively. Since there are no
retaliatory tariffs on U.S. barley, the payment rate for barley is
$0.00/bu.
County A's payment rate is calculated as follows:

Step 1: For each crop in a county, multiply fixed historical
acres, fixed historical yields, and the payment rate per unit
for each eligible non-specialty MFP crop

County A Corn Damage: 20,000 acres  180 bu/acre
$0.14/bu = $504,000

County A Soybeans Damage: 10,000 acres  60 bu/acre
$2.05/bu =
$1,230,000

County A Barley Damage: 1,000 acres  50 bu/acre
$0.00/bu = $0

Step 2: Sum all calculated values from Step 1

$504,000 + $1,230,000 + $0 = $1,734,000 in total non-
specialty crop damage

Step 3: Sum the acres across all eligible non-specialty MFP
crops

20,000 + 10,000 + 1,000 = 31,000 acres

Step 4: Calculate the county payment rate per acre by
dividing the result of Step 2 by the result of Step 3

$1,734,000/31,000 = $56/acre non-specialty crop county
payment

Acres reported to the Farm Service Agency between 2015-2018 are
used to calculate the historical fixed acres for each crop within a
county. The 2015-2017 historical fixed county yield is calculated using
the following cascade:

1.  RMA county yield,

2.  NASS county yield, if the RMA county yield is unavailable,

3.  RMA T-yield, if the both the RMA county yield and NASS county
yield are unavailable,

4.  NASS state yield, if (1)-(3) are unavailable, and

5.  NASS national yield, if (1)-(4) are unavailable.
Prevent Plant
2019 planting was characterized by substantial rainfall and cool
weather that delayed planting of crops across the United States.
Producers prevented from planting a 2019 non-specialty crop, but who
planted a CCC-approved cover crop, with the potential to be harvested,
qualify for a $15 per acre payment.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\8\ https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2019/07/25/usda-
announces-details-support-package-farmers. USDA is not legally
authorized to make Market Facilitation Program payments to producers
for acreage that is not planted. However, cover crops planed with the
purpose of providing animal feed or other marketing purpose are
eligible for a minimum payment of $15 per acre.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cups and Caps
The county payment rates per acre are cupped and capped at $15 per
acre and $150 per acre, respectively.
2019 MFP Payments and Payment Rates for Hogs and Milk
Hogs: 2019 MFP payments for hog producers are based on live hog
inventory on a day selected by the applicant between April 1, 2019 and
May 15, 2019. Eligibility for 2019 MFP payments is again based upon
independent ownership of the hogs; persons/legal entities that are
contracted to grow hogs are not eligible for 2019 MFP.

Calculate the per unit payment rate for hogs:

Step 1: Calculate the gross trade damage estimate
Step 2: Subtract the FPDP purchase amount from the gross
trade damage estimate to calculate the portion not covered by
FPDP
Step 3: Divide the value from Step 2 by the number of hogs
reported in the 2019 March inventory report to calculate the
MFP payment rate per hog

Milk: 2019 MFP payments for dairy producers are based on historical
production, the same as what was reported for participation in the USDA
Dairy Margin Coverage Program or its predecessor, the Margin Protection
Program for Dairy. The ownership share for milk will be as reported to
FSA for the aforementioned programs for dairy operations that were in
business as of June 1, 2019. Dairy operations that were not in business
as of June 1, 2019, are ineligible for MFP.

Calculate the per unit payment rate for milk:

Step 1: Calculate the gross trade damage estimate
Step 2: Subtract the FPDP purchase amount from the gross
trade damage estimate to calculate the portion not covered by
FPDP
Step 3: Divide the value from Step 2 by 2017 MPP production
to get the MFP payment rate per cwt of milk

2019 MFP Payments and Payment Rates for Specialty Crops
Similar to the 2018 MFP, producers of an expanded list of specialty
crops will be eligible for program payments. 2019 MFP payments for
specialty crops are based on 2019 acres of fruit or nut bearing plants.
For specialty fruits and ginseng, the payment rate is multiplied by the
average yields listed on https://www.farmers.gov/manage/mfp.

Calculate the payment rate for specialty tree nuts:

Step 1: Calculate and sum all gross trade damage estimates
for all specialty tree nuts
Step 2: Sum bearing acres for all eligible tree nuts using
NASS Census data for 2017
Step 3: Divide total gross trade damages from Step 1 by total
acres from Step 2 to get the national tree nut rate ($/acre)

Calculate the payment rate for specialty fruits:

Step 1: For each specialty fruit, calculate the gross trade
damage estimate
Step 2: Calculate total production of the fruit crop using
2017 Census acreage and RMA yields
Step 3: Divide the trade damage estimate from Step 1 by
average production from Step 2 to get the per unit payment rate
($/lb)

Calculate the payment rate for ginseng:

Step 1: Calculate the gross trade damage estimate
Step 2: Calculate estimated ginseng production using 2017
Census data on ginseng acreage and USDA estimate of average
yields using industry and academic sources
Step 3: Divide the trade damage estimate from Step 1 by
estimated production from Step 2 to get the per unit payment
rate ($/lb)

Total MFP Payments
The total payments to producers are subject to payment limitations,
AGI eligibility criteria, and adjustments to the payment structure.
2019 MFP payments will be provided in up to three installments. The
first payment will be guaranteed, and is the higher of 50 percent of
the total calculated payment or $15 per acre. If CCC determines that a
second payment is warranted, it will be up to 75 percent of the total
calculated payment less the amount received in the first payment and
the second payment period will begin in November 2019. If CCC
determines that a final payment is warranted, it will be for the
remaining amount of the total calculated payment, unless otherwise
adjusted by CCC, and the last payment period will begin in January
2020.
For 2019 MFP payments, there will be three separate payment
limitations for each person or legal entity: \9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\9\ This excludes a joint venture or general partnership, as
defined and determined under 7 CFR part 1400.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  $250,000 for eligible non-specialty crops;

2.  $250,000 for eligible specialty crops; and

3.  $250,000 for hogs and milk.

4.  No person or legal entity can receive more than $500,000 under
2019 MFP.

Last, if the average adjusted gross income of a person or legal
entity is greater than $900,000, the person or entity is not eligible
to receive a MFP payment unless at least 75 percent of the adjusted
gross income of the person or entity is derived from farming, ranching,
or forestry related activities. The relevant years used to calculate
average AGI are the 3 consecutive tax years immediately preceding the
year before the payment year, which will be the crop year, or the
marketing year for livestock or dairy. For example, for 2019 the
relevant years to calculate AGI are the 2015, 2016 and 2017 tax years.
