Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property,

and the Internet

Committee on the Judiciary

Washington, DC

The Subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 2:02 p.m., 2141
Rayburn Building, Hon. Henry C. ``Hank'' Johnson, Jr. [Chair of
the Subcommittee] presiding.
Present: Representatives Johnson of Georgia [presiding],
Correa, Jeffries, Stanton, Lofgren, Cohen, Jackson Lee, Roby,
Jordan, Chabot, Gaetz, Johnson of Louisiana, Biggs, Cline, and
Tiffany.
Staff present: John Doty, Senior Advisor; John Williams,
Parliamentarian; Jamie Simpson, Chief Counsel; Rosalind
Jackson, Professional Staff Member; Christopher Hixon, Minority
Staff Director; Betsy Ferguson, Minority Senior Counsel;
Caroline Nabity, Minority Counsel; Kiley Bidelman, Minority
Clerk.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. The Subcommittee will come to
order. The chair is authorized to declare recesses of the
Subcommittee at any time.
Welcome to this afternoon's hearing on ``Maintaining
Judicial Independence and the Rule of Law: Examining the Causes
and Consequences of Court Capture.''
Before we begin, I would like to remind Members that we
have established an email address and distribution list
dedicated to circulating exhibits, motions, or other written
materials that Members might want to offer as part of our
hearing today.
If you would like to submit materials, please send them to
the email address that has been previously distributed to your
offices and we will circulate the materials to Members and
staff as quickly as we can.
I will now recognize myself for an opening statement.
This hearing has been rescheduled many times, and I thank
my colleagues for their patience, as we have worked to find a
date and I thank our Witnesses for their flexibility.
The issue of the politicization of our cherished court
system is a matter of great importance to me and, I am sure,
this sentiment is echoed by many of my colleagues here today.
I don't need to tell you that this hearing has taken on new
weight, given the events of the past week. The loss of Supreme
Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is something we all feel
acutely.
She was inspirational, not just as a way paver and role
model for generations of lawyers here and around the world. She
fought to protect so many of the rights that shape our lives as
citizens of this nation.
We are all better off in some small way because she touched
our lives. We know her as someone who started her career
fighting for women's equality and we know her as someone who
had a deep heartfelt commitment to our Constitution.
This is a personal loss to all of us. No one can ever
replace her, but we must honor her legacy by continuing to
fight for the rights she championed her entire career and by
protecting the institution that she loved.
What made Justice Ginsburg so beloved was her commitment to
justice. She wasn't a rubber stamp for anyone, not for a
president, not for a political party, not for an ideological
society or organization, and certainly not for any corporate
interests.
In an era when our Constitution is under attack and our
fundamental rights hang in the balance, the sanctity of the
third branch is essential to preserving our fragile democracy.
An independent and accountable court system is essential to
a free and fair democratic society. Without an accountable and
independent judiciary, the fundamental promise that all of us
are equal in the eyes of the law becomes a lie, and if the
American people believe that justice is no longer equal, our
judges lose a principle source of their authority, public faith
in their integrity.
Unlike the other branches of government, few
responsibilities of the judiciary are explicitly laid out in
the Constitution. The reason we entrust judges with so much
authority today is because we trust them to wield that
authority independently of politics, political ideology, and
personal connections.
Judges should not serve presidents, parties, or political
movements. They should not be seen as compromised by special
interests and dark money.
Judges should serve the cause of justice. Unfortunately,
over the past years we have seen the rushed appointment of
former political operatives to judgeships, a political and
ideological organization given undue weight in Federal judicial
nominations, and tens of millions of dollars spent by political
and ideological organizations on Federal nominations.
We have also seen the President repeatedly attack Federal
judges in an attempt to intimidate the courts into doing what
he says. We have also seen little movement by the judiciary to
protect its integrity against these assaults on the Rule of
law.
Somehow, the Supreme Court still refuses to adopt a code of
ethics. Somehow, the Judicial Conference is unable to advise
lower court judges that Membership in groups dedicated to
reshaping the judiciary is incompatible with their ethical
obligations.
Somehow, the Supreme Court still uses its shadow docket to
make life or death decisions via unsigned unexplained orders
issued in the dead of night. This should worry anyone who cares
about the political neutrality and independence of our judicial
system.
In the last few years, we have also seen the Senate fail to
live up to its constitutional obligation to dispassionately
consider each and every one of the President--of President
Trump's judicial nominees.
Americans now see the Senate as a rushed rubber stamp and
many of us on this side of the Capitol are forced to agree.
Dark money, partisan pressure, ideological litmus tests,
attacks by the President, a rubber stamp Senate, and a midnight
judicial appointment.
This is how courts are captured. This is how our judges can
be seen to have lost their connection to the American people
and to the Constitution.
This is how we lose the faith of our fellow citizens. It is
not too late. As a wise person once said, it is not dark yet.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is getting there. I, for one, am
deeply worried and it is time we investigate the depth and the
breadth of this trend.
I am looking forward to hearing from our esteemed Witnesses
who have agreed to share their knowledge and experiences with
us today.
It is now my pleasure to recognize the Ranking Member of
the Subcommittee, the gentlewoman from Alabama, Ms. Roby, for
her opening statement.
Ms. Roby. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you to all our
distinguished Witnesses for being here with us this afternoon.
This past Friday, we all learned about the passing of
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justice Ginsburg was
a faithful public servant and trailblazer.
She is an icon and will always be a role model for women
and men of all ages in the years to come. My prayers remain
with her family and loved ones.
Today's hearing is entitled ``Maintaining Judicial
Independence and the Rule of Law: Examining the Causes and
Consequences of Court Capture.''
This provides a timely opportunity to examine the role and
future of the Federal judiciary and the justices and judges who
preside over impartial justice.
While the title is, certainly, a mouthful, we plan to
discuss the resources and tactics by private groups during
nomination and confirmation process of judges and the idea that
one side is seemingly capturing the courts.
This hearing also plans to explore the participation of
sitting Federal judges in legal organizations such as the
Federalist Society, American Constitution Society, and the
American Bar Association.
Under current Federal election laws, groups such as social
welfare organizations, labor unions, trade associations, and
Chambers of Commerce are not required to disclose names of
individual donors unless they are making electioneering
communications or independent expenditures to expressly
advocate for the election or defeat of a candidate.
Because these organizations generally advocate in regard to
specific issues and not endorsing or opposing specific
candidates, their activities are overseen by the IRS and do not
fall under FEC jurisdiction.
This is in contrast with political action committees, also
known as PACs, that advocate or donate on behalf of specific
candidates. Our Witnesses will discuss balancing the importance
of First amendment speech with the public's interest in
understanding who is making financial contributions.
This hearing will also cover what the majority has termed
court capture, which describes the idea that one party is
taking over the courts, apparently by nefarious means.
Regardless of who is president, regardless of what party
they come from, if there is an opening on the Federal
judiciary, the President should nominate a person for that role
and the Senate should decide whether the candidate is qualified
enough to be confirmed so our Federal courts can continue to
function effectively.
During the nomination and confirmation process, it is
proper and the American public should be able to voice their
opinions to their elected officials about how they believe
would be the best nominee.
Whether a person's voice is expressed through a letter,
phone call, email, or financial donation, the public should be
able to make their voices heard. Private organizations have the
right under current finance laws to advocate for policy
positions and laws.
A President and Senators ultimately have the only authority
on the judicial nominees, not outside groups, no matter how
much money they spend with their advocacy campaign.
Just because a President, whether Democratic or Republican,
nominates a candidate for the Federal bunch does not mean that
they are, quote, ``capturing the courts,'' end quote.
Finally, we will hear from our Witnesses on Advisory
Opinion 117, released by the Judicial Conference Code of
Conduct Committee earlier this year. In this advisory opinion,
the Committee determined that membership in the American Bar
Association was acceptable, but membership in the Federalist
Society and the American Constitution Society was inconsistent
with the Federal Judges Code of Conduct canons.
Following reports of the draft advisory opinion, there was
a--there was widespread criticism and concerns on the reasoning
behind barring membership in certain organizations while
allowing membership in others.
The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts decided to
ultimately table Advisory Opinion 117 and not publish it.
Although at this time the issue is, largely, moot, I still look
forward to hearing from our Witnesses on this issue.
I want to, again, thank all our distinguished Witnesses for
being here with us this afternoon and I look forward to hearing
your testimony on all of these very important issues.
With that, Mr. Chair, I yield back.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. I thank the gentlelady from
Alabama.
There being no opening statements from either Full
Committee Chair or Ranking Member of the Full Committee, I will
proceed now to our Witness.
I will now introduce the first panelist.
Senator Sheldon Whitehouse has represented the State of
Rhode Island in the United States Senate since 2007 where he
serves on the Judiciary Committee, the Finance Committee, the
Environment and Public Works Committee, and the Budget
Committee.
Before being elected to the Senate, Senator Whitehouse
served as Rhode Island's U.S. Attorney and State Attorney
General. Senator Whitehouse is a graduate of Yale University
and the University of Virginia School of Law.
Welcome, Senator Whitehouse, and you may begin.
Before your testimony, however, I am reminding you that
your written and oral statements made to the Subcommittee in
connection with this hearing are subject to penalties of
perjury, pursuant to 18 USC 1001, which may result in the
imposition of a fine or imprisonment of up to five years or
both.
With that, you may proceed.

TESTIMONY OF HON. SHELDON WHITEHOUSE

Senator Whitehouse. Thank you, Chair.
Chair Johnson, Ranking Member Roby, and Members of the
Committee, first, I pay respect to Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose
life was a uniquely American story of passion and courage,
leavened with determination and purpose to achieve justice and
progress. She deserves a special place in America's pantheon.
She will join our history among the greats, and I honor her
today.
Second, I ask that our Senate Democratic Report on Court
Capture and a Harvard Journal of Legislation article be made a
part of the record.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Without objection.

POLICY ESSAY

DARK MONEY AND U.S. COURTS: THE PROBLEM AND SOLUTIONS

Senator Sheldon Whitehouse*
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Sheldon Whitehouse served as Rhode Island's United States
Attorney and Attorney General before being elected to the United States
Senate in 2006. He is a Member of the Judiciary Committee and the
ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism.
Senator Whitehouse has worked to strengthen American cybersecurity
capabilities, improve resources to fight drug abuse and treat addiction
in Rhode Island, and reverse the rise in prison populations and costs.
He is a lending advocate for protecting access to justice, including
the Seventh Amendment right to a civil jury. In response to a series of
judgments favoring powerful corporate imterests, Senator Whitehouse has
warned of the dangers of judicial activism and dark money influence
over the judicial selection process. A strong supporter of greater
transparency in the judicial system, Senator Whitehouse has introduced
legislation to the require Supreme Court justices and Federal judges to
disclose travel and hospitality perks they receive as prominent public
figures, and to require the meaningful disclosure of funders of amicus
curiae briefs. In addition to Judiciary, he is a member of the Budget,
the Environment and Public Works, and the Finance Committees.

``There are more instances of the abridgement of the freedom of
the people by gradual and silent encroachments of those in
power than by violent and sudden usurpations.''
--James Madison

I. Introduction

The Founding Fathers had many threats in mind when they
crafted a constitution for our young and fragile nation. Locke,
Montesquieu, and other Enlightenment thinkers offered helpful
political theory, but theory went only so far. Our Founders
knew that patriotism could be overborne by selfish impulses and
personal passions; that foreign governments and rapacious
elites could exploit weak institutions; and that sharp
differences divided the thirteen colonies. They planned for a
lot of threats and dangers--but they did not plan for the
corrupting power of corporations.
Today, corporations wield commanding power in our
democracy. They do so directly, and through a network of trade
associations, think tanks, front groups, and political
organizations. That power too often is directed by cor- porate
forces to dodge accountability for harms to the public; to
subvert the free market to their advantage; and to protect
their own political power by undermining democratic
institutions.
This article explores the expansion of that corporate power
in our government, and its extension into a branch of
government customarily viewed as insulated from special
interest influence: The Federal Judiciary. I begin with a brief
historical overview of corporate influence in America and a
discussion of how that influence grew after the Supreme Court's
decision in Citizens United v. FEC.\1\ I then tum to the fifty-
year-long project of the corporate right to reshape both
Federal law and the Federal bench; to the scheme's tools,
particularly anonymous ``dark money'' and the network of front
groups behind which these interests hide; and to the long-
fought scheme's ultimate successes, culminating in the massive
power grabs achieved in the Trump administration. The article
concludes with recommendations for legislation that would
increase transparency at the Court. We must address the crisis
of legitimacy the courts now face before captured courts become
a national scandal.

II. Corporations, Then and Now

The Federalist Papers provide an important window into the
concerns that animated the Founding Era as citizens considered
a new Constitution for their colonies. The concerns that
Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay addressed were
the prominent ones around which debate centered and on which
the public needed reassurance. The main concerns were
protecting individuals against the power of government (e.g.,
The Federalist No. 51); \2\ protecting democracy against the
emergence of a new aristocracy or royalty (e.g., The Federalist
No. 38); \3\ and protecting society from the power of faction--
what we today call partisanship and special interest (e.g., The
Federalist No. 10).\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ The Federalist No. 51 (James Madison).
\3\ The Federalist No. 38 (James Madison).
\4\ The Federalist No. 10 (James Madison).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
We honor our Constitution, but it alone did not satisfy the
colonial public. The Framers had to draft our Bill of Rights to
protect explicitly an array of individual rights and fortify
those rights with powerful defenses. Thence came freedom of
speech, access to the jury, clearly delineated criminal process
rights, and other protections.\5\ Together, the Constitution
and Bill of Rights won the confidence of the American people
and unified our country behind a single vision of Federal
Government.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\5\ The Declaration of Independence (U.S. 1776); see also Gerard N.
Magliocca, The Bill of Rights as a term of Art, 92 Notre Dame L. Rev.
231, 236 (2016) (noting that ``Jefferson did write one letter in 1792
that stated: `[M]y objection to the Constitution was, that it wanted a
bill of rights securing freedom of religion, freedom of the press,
freedom from standing armies, [and] trial by jury . . . . The sense of
America has approved my objection and added the Bill of Rights.' '').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
All of these efforts and robust debates reveal by omission
that the Founders had a blind spot: They did not anticipate any
threat to individuals from the power of corporations. It is
easy to understand why not. For the Founders, corporations were
not front of mind. The word ``corporation'' only appears in the
eighty-five Federalist Papers three times, with one of those a
reference to municipal corporations.\6\ The word barely
registers in Madison's note of the Federal Convention.\7\ On
our American continent, the big British corporation threatened
no harm: The B1itish Hudson Bay Company operated in remote
areas of Canada; the Massachusetts Bay Company had become a
colony;\8\ the British East India Company had been humbled\9\
Such smaller corporations a existed in d1e colonie were
creatioru of State legisla- tures, and operated und er the
watchful eye of local political force, usually to provide
roads, canals and other welcome infrastructure. If a
corporation overstepped its bounds or harmed its local
community, political authorities could revoke its charter.\10\
At the Founding, corporate entities were no threat to the
fledgling democracy and the idea of such non-human entities
achieving a dominant role in a republic of ``We the People''
would have seemed fanciful.

power to revoke or amend'' the Connecticut Medical Society's charter
and how ``[t]he Pennsylvania General Assembly revoked [the Bank of
North America's] corporate charter'' by ``rel[ying] on a committee
report citing the bank's inordinate power'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fast forward to the modem era where corporations are now
ubiquitous and hold massive political power throughout
government. Let's consider how.
One obvious exercise of that power is through corporate
lobbying. Congress swarm with corporate lobbyists. In 2018
alone, corporations spent $3.4 billion on direct lobbying.\11\
One trade organization, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, has spent
over $1.5 billion lobbying over the past two decades.\12\ Much
of its effort has been on political mischief like climate
denial.\13\ Mick Mulvaney, after leaving Congress to serve as
the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, said
something that illustrated one aspect of the problem: Be told
an American Bankers Association conference that ``[w]e had a
hierarchy in my office in Congress, [i]f you're a lobbyist who
never gave us money, I didn't talk to you. If you're a lobbyist
who gave us money, I might talk to you.''\14\

Which takes us to the next problem: Corporate spending in
elections. Gone are the days when the problem was trickles of
corporate money flowing from corporate political action
committees (``PACs'') and lobbyists' checkbooks into
candidates' campaign war chests. Tn the wake of the Supreme
Court's infamous Citizens United decision,\15\ corporate
interests have flooded huge sums of money into electioneering
and advocacy groups, often anonymizing themselves in the
process, and used this flotilla of front groups to sway
election results. In the 2012 Federal election cycle
immediately following Citizens United, spending by these so-
called ``outside'' groups surged to more than triple their
political spending from the cycle before.\16\ By 2016, outside
groups would spend over $1.4 billion in American election.\17\
Today, in major elections around the country outside groups
often outspend the actual candidates: In 2018, outside groups
spent more than the candidates campaigns in twenty-eight
different Federal races,\18\ and in Indiana during the last
election cycle dark-money and outside groups outspent the U.S.
Senate candidates by nearly $35 million.\19\ You don't spend
this kind of money for long if you are not getting results.

Much of this spending is ``dark money''--funding that
cannot be traced to actual donors. In the decade since Citizens
United, groups that don't disclose their donors have spent
nearly $1 billion in elections, compared to only $129 million
over the previous decade.\20\ This staggering figure does not
even include money spent on ``issue ads,'' which are often just
thinly veiled political attack ads, but are not reported to the
Federal Election Commission.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Although the Citizens United decision imaginatively
presumed a campaign finance system with ``effective
disclosure,''\21\ corporate interests quickly exploited
loopholes to keep their spending anonymous, and the Court has
conspicuously failed to police its supposed ``effective
disclosure.'' Three loopholes have been particular favorites.
Internal Revenue Code 501(c)(4) ``social welfare''
organizations have been allowed to spend on political
altivities, but need not disclose their donors to the
public.\22\ Shell corporations (e.g., limited liability
corporations that obscure their true beneficial owners) \23\
are a simple tool to hide donor identities. And donor-directed
trusts have been subverted into massive laundering shops that
strip donor identities away from contributions to politically
active non-profits.\24\ Because corporate brands and
reputations are precious commodities, a broad array of trade
associations, think tanks, and advocacy groups insulates
corporations from the dirty practices and unpopular purposes of
this vast new enterprise.

``[t]he real disclosure issue arises when a 501(c)(4) social welfare

donations from a dummy or shell corporation or LLC which gets its funds
from one or a small number of shareholders, or from a nonprofit that
does not have a mass Membership base but serves primarily as a vehicle
for pooling funds from a small number of large donors and channeling
them to independent spending committees'').
\24\ Donors Trust is one of these groups, for example, See Andy
Kroll, Exposed: The Dark Money ATM of the Conservative Movement, Mother
Jones (Feb. 5, 2013), https://www .motherjones.com/politics/2013/02/
donors-trust-donor-capital-fund-dark-money-koch-bradley-devos/ [https:/
/perma.cc/S9M3-N7YC] (``Donors Trust is a so-called `donor-advised
fund,' a breed apart from a family foundation like, say, the Lynde and
Harry Bradley Foundation, which helped build the conservative movement
over decades with donations totaling tens of millions of dollars. The
people who donate to Donors Trust don't get final say over how their
money isspent. But they get to recommend where their cash goes, and in
exchange for giving up some

Continued
control, they get a bigger tax write-off than they would with a family

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the heart of this is money, but money alone is not the
entire danger. As any politician can tell you, with the ability
to spend millions of dollars in elections comes the ability to
threaten or promise such expenditures. With the ability to
spend millions of dollars anonymously, the menace of such
threats darkens. Sometimes the threats or promises might be
general and public; \25\ but the greatest danger of corruption
comes from threats or promises made covertly. The threat is
real--a massive barrage of anonymous campaign spending in the
waning days of a campaign can leave voters with no information
about who is making the attack and the target with no time to
respond. An early barrage can ``define'' (read, mercilessly
smear) a candidate before his or her campaign even gets up and
running. So threats are credible, and covert threats and
acquiescence is the very definition of corruption.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dark money fouls political debate, as well. From the
shelter of anonymity, corporate interests can without
accountability propagate a ``tsunami of slime'' \26\--the
manufactured front group bears the onus for the smears and
attacks, and can be disposed of like Kleenex.\27\ And of course
if just the threat of a slimy political attack is successful,
it saves the special interest from actually having to spend the
money. Worse, it leaves the public unaware that anything went
on behind the scenes.

The policy result of unlimited special-interest spending
power is unsurprising: A powerful political current bends
elected officials toward the will of the special interests,
even against the will of their constituents.\28\ This weakens
the political system's response to the general population, and
skews political response toward wealthy interests. Empirically,
one study found:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\28\ See, e.g., Martin Gilens, Afflulince and Influence: Economic
Inequality and Polical Power in America 70-123 (2012) (explaining that
the country's policymnkers respond almost exclusively to the
preferences of the economically advantaged); see also Lawrence Lessig,
Republic, Lost: How Money Corrupts Congress--and a Plan To Stop It
1143-47 (2011) (noting that dependency donors cause Congress to spend
more time on issues that matter to their funders than to the general
public).

[T]he views of constituents in the upper third of the income
distribution received about 50% more weight than those in the
middle third, with even larger disparities on specific salient
roll call votes. Meanwhile, the views of constituents in the
bottom third of the income distribution received no weight at
all in the voting decisions of their Senators.\29\

the New Gilded Age 253-54 (2008).

The problem is not just in Congress. The ability of big
interests to deploy unlimited money from behind dark-money from
groups into presidential races has similar effects.\30\ But
much of the corporate political effort is down at the executive
agency level. Corporations have grown adept at capturing
regulatory agencies.\31\ This involve one amount of high-
powered agency lobbying, and some amount of simply outgunning
ill-funded public interest advocates in administrative
procedures but more often than npt it involves ending industry
personnel to embed with regulators--the ``revolving door.''
According to an analysis by ProPublica and Columbia Journalism
Investigations the Trump administration has brought into
official positions at least 281 former corporate lobbyists,
just through October 2019.\32\ That number increases when one
includes the corporate executives embedded in the Trump
administration who may not have technically lobbied for their
company but nontheless are motivated to influence outcomes for
their industry.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The result has been an unprecedented capture of regulatory
agencies by the interests they should be regulating.\33\ The
Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'') under the Trump
adminstration, for example, bas been overrun with officials
tied closely to polluting industries. Former EPA Administrator
Scott Pruitt rose to political power by raising funds for oil
and gas industry groups.\34\ Pruitt had demonstrated an unusual
willingness to do the industry's bidding; in one instance, he
put fossil fuel industry text verbatim onto his official
Oklahoma Attorney General letterhead and submitted it to the
EPA.\35\ Later, as EPA Administrator, Pruitt could do the
industry's bidding directly, without need for such subterfuge.
Andrew Wheeler, Pruitt's successor as Administrator, had been a
leading lobbyist for the coal industry.\36\ Trump's first head
of the EPA Office of Air and Radiation, Bill Wehrum, gained
prominence by helping build and run an array of fossil fuel
industry trade associations and front groups.\37\

The Founders would likely have been astounded that such a
commanding political force arose in our Republic, exerting such
control over our executive and legislativ branches. Industry
lobbying distorts legislative outcomes. Post-Citizens United
dark-money election spending constricts Ame1ica's political
aperture. Regulatory capture in the Trump administration has
spread corruption widely through government agencies. But the
most coveted prize, tbe pearl beyond price of influence-
seeking, lies in the courts.

III. The Corporate Influence Machine Targets Article III Courts

Courts set rules. Federal courts decide what the
Constitution means. Federal courts decide how laws are applied.
Federal courts set the ground rules for challenges to
legislation; they set rules for executive agency process and
review; and they set rules that govern commercial and political
activity.
The prospect of resetting all those rules to advance
systematically one's own power and position makes courts an
alluring target for the influence machine. At the same time,
because so many judicial practices and principles are designed
to keep courts honest and independent, they are a difficult
target. The stalking and capture of the courts had to be
measured and slow. In 1971, prominent corporate lawyer and
future Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell wrote a secret memo
to an official at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Powell warned
that ``the American economic system''--by which he seemed to
mean corporate America--``is under broad attack'' from
academics, the media, leftist politicians, and other
progressives.\41\ To counter the progressive spirit that had
delivered the New Deal and Great Society, Powell wrote, it was
time for an unprecedented influence campaign on the part of
corporate America. He advised:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\41\ Confidential Memorandum from Lewis F. Powell Jr., to Eugene B.
Snydor, Jr., Chair, Education Committee, U.S. Chamber of Commerce 1
(Aug. 23, 1971), https://scholarlycommons .law.wlu.cdu/cgi/
viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=powellmemo [https://perma.cc/5Q9B-
RFTX].

[I]ndependent and uncoordinated activity by individual
corporations, as important as this is, will not be sufficient.
Strength lies in organization, in careful long-range planning
and implementation, in consistency of action over an indefinite
period of years, in the scale of financing available only
through joint effort, and in the so political power available
only through united action and national organizations.\42\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\42\ Id. at 11.

Corporate forces followed this advice, and today we see how
much the ``political power'' made available through ``united
action'' has delivered in the executive and legislative
branches. Powell also flagged the value of pro-corporate
``activist'' judges to shape the courts and the law, and slowly
but surely corporate forces began to reshape our judiciary.
Over many patient year they produced not only pro-corporate,
anti-regulatory judges and doctrine, but a coordinated array of
front groups set up to effect this infiltration. Behind this
network of front groups lurks a network of corporate, right-
wing donors who secretly fund this ``united action'' in the
judiciary.\43\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\43\ See, Jason Zengeric, How the Trump Administration Is Remaking
the Courts, N.Y. Times (Aug. 22, 2018). https://www.nytime.com/2018/08/

ZS9B] (arguing that ``even circuits that are decidedly liberal are
undergoing significant changes'' and that ``a radically new Federal
judiciary could be with us long after Trump is gone'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
There have long been competing philosophies of adjudication
and legal analysis, a debate reflected over decades in
different judicial philosophies from Republican and Democratic
presidents' court nominees. This exercise was different. This
was about winning, not about theories. Tellingly, the record of
the many ``conservative'' wins under Chief Justice Roberts in
the Supreme Court shows more often that conservative entities
are the victors than that conservative judicial principles are
followed.\44\ The donors behind the scheme want victories and
are not fussy about philosophy.

It is slowly becoming clear how the so-called conservative
legal movement has been secretly bankrolled by corporate
interests which benefit from that legal movement. It is even
sometimes frankly admitted. Describing his efforts to stock the
Federal judiciary, Donald McGahn, the former White House
Counsel and early architect of the Trump administration's
judicial selection efforts, did not even try to hide the
connection: ``There is a coherent plan here where actually the
judicial selection and the deregulatory effort are really the
flip side of the same coin.'' \45\ In other words, the ``plan''
is to groom and select judges who will then support the
Republican political effort to roll back unwelcome laws passed
by Congress and unwelcome regulations developed by independent
agencies.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The influence machine's efforts in the Federal judiciary
are particularly pernicious for government. First, unlike
legislators and political appointees, Federal judges receive
lifetime appointments. Successfully capturing a judicial seat
can reward the capturer for decades,\46\ and popular umbrage
cannot ``throw the bum out'' in the next election.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\46\ See, U.S. Const. Art. III, Sec. 1 (providing for lifetime
tenure of Federal judges).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Second, in a captured court, strategic advances can be won
deep in the weeds of jargon and theory, where the public is
less likely to appreciate the ultimate impact; judicial
decisions expanding the ``unitary executive'' theory \47\ or
limiting Auer \48\ and Chevron \49\ deference to administrative
agency expertise are not obvious blows to the environment or
public health. Mischief can be done outside the spotlight of
popular attention.

Third, special interests can ask captured courts to do
things Republican legislators wouldn't dare vote for--like
allowing unlimited and ultimately anonymous money into
politics.\50\ Courts are designed to make unpopular decisions
in the service of justice; a captured court can deliver
unpopular decisions in the service of politics.

\50\ See, e.g., Brief for U.S. Chamber of Commerce as Amicus Curiae
Supporting Appellant, Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310 (2010)
(acknowledging that ``immensely wealthy individuals play a significant
role in our political process'' and asking the Court to allow
``corporations to spend freely on independent candidate advocacy'').

Finally, courts have traditionally been viewed as mostly
apolitical--neutral arbiters of law and fact.\51\ Accordingly,
the political branches have treated them with deference,
largely leaving it to the judiciary to set its own ground
rules. As a result, the courts, and most notably the Supreme
Court, operate in unusual secrecy, protected by a veneer of
neutrality.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\51\ See, e.g., The Federalist No. 78 (Alexander Hamilton) (``The
judiciary has no influence over either the sword or the purse, no
direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the society, and
can take no active resolution whatever. It may be truly said to have
neither force nor will, but merely judgment.'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

IV. The Apparatus of Capture

To accomplish the capture effort, special interests and
their sophisticated teams of lawyers and political operatives
have systematically developed an apparatus whose purpose is
first to influence the selection and confirmation of judges,
and then to influence the judges' decisions in the courts.\52\
This apparatus is most visible at the Supreme Court, but it
operates in lower courts, too. Here is its battle plan:

interest-groups-high-court [https://perma.cc/564L-WQQE] (finding that
``interest group spending on television ads and other lobbying tools
can have a potent effect on who becomes a judge in America'').

Select carefully vetted judges who embrace the desired
pro-corporate world view.\53\ This is done by giving a controlling role
in judicial selection to an organization to which the interests give
millions of dollars (the Federalist Society);
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

critics on Twitter as well as one regarding Trump's businesses

Leo's role in selecting Neil Gorsuch and Bret Kavanaugh).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unleash millions in dark money supporting the nominee (or
opposing him in Judge Merrick Garland's case).\54\ This is done through
an organization (the Judicial Crisis Network (``JCN'')) that uses
anonymous donations to fund political advertising campaigns for (or
against) nominees;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\54\ See, O'Harrow & Boburg. supra note 53 (noting the Judicial
Crisis Network spent $10 million to support Supreme Court Justice Neil
Gorsuch's confirmation after spending $7 mil1ion to block President
Barack Obama's Supreme Court pick, Meuick Garland).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

With their judges in place, tee up strategic cases and
inundate courts with amicus briefs-best understood as lobbying
documents. This is done through a flotilla of closely related front
groups. These front groups sometimes appear as the litigant, behind a
plaintiff of convenience; and sometimes among a flotilla of ``amici
curiae'' signaling in harmony how the influence machine wants the court
to decide.\55\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\55\ See, e.g., Brian R. Frazelle, Corporate Clout: As the Roberts
Court Transforms, the Chamber Has Another Big Term. Const. Account

of-the-court briefs in 15 cases . . . [a]nd in 12 of those case, or
80%, the position advocated by the Chamber prevailed'').

It's quite an investment, but it has paid stunning dividends.
The funding that fuels the judicial influence machine is
difficult to expose because of its secrecy, but the
coordination, tactics, and strategy of the influence machine
are becoming less obscure. One case study is the outside
spending group, JCN. According to tax filings, an unnamed donor
gave $17 million to JCN to help block President Obama's
nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court and support
President Trump's nomination of Neil Gorsuch to that same
vacancy.\56\ Then, in 2018, a donor--perhaps the same one--gave
another $17 million to JCN to support the troubled nomination
of Brett Kavanaugh.\57\ JCN received many more anonymous
multimillion-dollar donations along the way. A sophisticated
media relations campaign, orchestrated by a firm CRC Public
Relations interconnected in the web of dark money groups, put
those millions to work on political-campaign-style
advertising.\58\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
JCN is one of many groups working in close coordination. To
understand that coordination let's visit one prominent
individual: Federalist Society Co-Chair Leonard Leo.\59\ Prom
his perch at the Federalist Society, Leo has been the lynchpin
and chief strategist of the conservative legal movement's
court-packing plan for the better part of two decades.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\59\ See, Jonathan Swan & Alayna Treene, Leonard Leo to Shape New
Conservative Network, Axios (Jan. 7, 2020), https://www.axios.com/

recently, and for the period relevant to this Article, Leo served as
the Federalist Society's Executive Vice President and that it has been
reported that he has Limited his role in the Federalist Society in
order to establish a new dark money operation focusing on the
judiciary.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Federalist Society claim it is merely a not-for-profit
group for like-minded aspiring lawyers eeking to discuss
conservative ideas and judicial doctrine. The truth, however is
more complicated. In effect, tbere are three incarnation of tbe
Federalist Society. The first is perfectly appropriate: A
debating society for conservatives at law schools and in legal
communities across the country to discuss traditionally
conservative judicial values, like originalism and the merits
of limited government. The second, is familiar in Washington,
DC: A think tank tbat attract big-name conservative lawyers
scholars, politicians, and even Supreme Court Justices to
events; that publishes and podcasts and that holds galas.\60\
The third role of the Federalist Society is the dangerous one:
It is the vehicle for powerful interests seeking to reorder the
judiciary by grooming, vetting, and selecting amenable
judges.\61\

2018/08/22/magazine/trump-remaking-courts-judiciary.html [https://
perma.cc/W598-ZS9B] (``Trump might not have known much nbout the law,
but he needed . . . to create the impression that he would be reliable
in terms of conservative judges, because that would calm down and
consolidate a very large block of coalition.' That is, what mattered to
the Federalist Society--and the Heritage Foundation--was that Trump
take their advice on judicial nominees. In an interview with Breitbart
in June 2016, Trump pledged, `We're going to have great judges,
conservative. all picked by Federalist Society.' '').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Federalist Society role is the result of many years of
work by Leo and his network of donors. As early as 2003, Leo
was known in the Bush White House as the coordinator of ``all
outside coalition activity regarding judicial nominations.''
\62\ In October 2006, Leo presented to students at the
University of Virginia (``UVA'') School of Law an overview of
the measures used to help confirm George W. Bush nominees John
Roberts and Samuel Alito. According to an article about the UVA
event, Leo's strategies included the following:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\62\ O'Harrow & Boburg, supra note 53.

``Aggressive fundraising to hire a top media firm. About
$15 million was spent for both confirmations on earned and paid media,
telemarketing, and other grassroots mobilization

``Advance work recruiting more than 60 organizations to
support the nomination and confirmation of a person committed to
conservative priorities

``Polling to figure out what the American people thought
the role of the court should be so that the message could be framed in
a way that resonated with the public

``Preparation of background memos and briefing materials
on every conceivable nominee

``Research into how Justices William Rehnquist and Sandra
Day O'Connor affected the vote count in controversial areas of law

``A search of history to learn how controversial issue
areas had been handled in earlier confirmations

``Publishing White papers to paint the ground favorably
when it comes to the questions that are appropriate for a nominee to
answer

``Training expert lawyers in how to talk to the media

``Holding dozens of background, off-the-record meetings
with reporters to give them information about the nomination and
confirmation process'' \63\

T35W-3AJV].

This playbook is still in use today. In the spring of 2019,
The Washington Post published an in-depth investigation of Leo
and his present network of organizations.\64\ It is massive,
secretive, and lavishly funded, and its purpose is to pack and
influence the courts.\65\ As the Post found through public
records and interviews, the groups in Leo's orbit work in close
coordination and are linked through multiple vectors: Finances,
board members, phone numbers, addresses, office support staff,
and operational details.\66\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anonymous funding is the lifeblood of this network and its
judicial influence campaign. Between 2014 and 2017, Leo's
nonprofits collected more than $250 million in dark-money
donations.\67\ Secret donors providing money at that quarter-
billion-dollar scale obviously expect a robust return on their
investment, and this money was used to carry out all manner of
activities to achieve that return. The Post unearthed a list of
clients of a conservative media relationsfirm outlining the
network's role in the Garland and Gorsuch nomination battles:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\67\ See id.

Nine of the [Leo-affiliated] groups hired the same conservative
media relations firm, Creative Response Concepts, collectively
paying it more than $10 million in contracting fees in 2016 and
2017. During that time, the firm coordinated a months-long
media campaign in support of Trump's Supreme Court nominee,
Neil M. Gorsuch, including publishing opinion essays,
contributing 5,000 quotes to news stories, scheduling pundit
appearances on television and posting online videos that were
viewed 50 million times, according to a report on the firm's
website.\68\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\68\ See id.

This description tracks closely the methods outlined by Leo
years before at UVA.
While the plan has been long in the making, in the Trump
administration it has become open and obvious. As a Member of
the Senate Judiciary Committee, I have seen the dark-money-
funded politicization of the judicial nomination and
confirmation process emerge, climb to top political priority
(it now dwarfs any legislative activity in the Senate), and pay
remarkable dividends. According to an October 2019 analysis by
the Senate Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, the
Republican-controlled Senate had allowed less than one-sixth
the number of votes on legislation and amendments compared to
the Democratic-controlled House.\69\ Meanwhile, as of February
2020, the Senate has confirmed 193 article III judges during
the Trump administration, including fifty-one influential
appellate judges--nearly as many as President Obama appointed
in his eight-year presidency (fifty-five).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\69\ Analysis on file with Democratic Policy and Communications
Committee.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Federalist Society now counts eighty-five percent of
the Trump administration's Supreme Court and circuit court
nominees as members.\70\ In November 2019, at his first major
public event since taking his seat on the Supreme Court bench,
Justice Kavanaugh spoke to a high-priced Federalist Society
gala fundraiser.\71\ Justice Kavanaugh thanked Federalist
Society member and Trump White House Counsel Donald McGahn for
his help during the confirmation process; \72\ McGahn once
quipped that be had been ``in-sourced'' to the White House to
deliver on the Federalist Society's priorities.\73\ Justice
Kavanaugh appreciatively called McGahn his ``coach.'' \74\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
With vetted and selected judges in place comes the next
step: Strategically guiding the Court to desired outcome. Again
dark money plays a role: Over years, anonymously funded group
have sprung up to serve this effort. One task is to seek out
case with fact pattern that support arguments for changes in
law the big interests desire, and then bring those cases before
the Court. To get there, these legal organization recruit
plaintiffs, usually with the offer of free services.
(Ordinarily, in real litigation, the plaintiff selects the
lawyer, not vice versa.)
I saw this happen in a case I argued before the Supreme
Court. The dark-money-funded Pacific Legal Foundation swept in
from across the country and recruited a Rhode Island plaintiff,
who agreed to let them bring this case before the Supreme
Court.\75\ When the Court' decision ultimately did not get them
the result they wished to achieve, they dropped him, and went
on to other cases. Pacific Legal Foundation is still at it
before the Court.\76\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\75\ See Palazzolo v. Rhode lslnnd. 533 U.S. 606 (2001).
\76\ In 2019, Pacific Legal Foundation represented the petitioner
in Knick v. Township of Scott, 139 S. Ct. 2162 (2019) where the Supreme
Court overruled precedent that required properly owners to seek
compensation for state and local property takings in State courts
before seeking compensation in Federal courts. Id. at 2179.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once one of these groups gets the case up before the Court,
an armada of related amici curiae (``friends of then court'')
sails in to echo and amplify the corporate message. Many of
these amici are funded by the same donors.
In recent amicu brief I wrote, I pointed out tbe common
funding of many of the other amici in that very case, and how
at least thirteen of those amici were funded by entities that
also have funded the Federalist Society.\77\ The Center for
Media and Democracy noted the brief and followed up with a more
robust analysis--indeed a stunning analysis--finding that
``sixteen right-wing foundations gave nearly $69 million to
groups urging the Supreme Court to abolish the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau since 2014'' and that the same
sixteen foundations had given over $33 million to the
Federalist Society over the same period.\78\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Applying the ``united action'' campaign to the courts
required a long and patient effort, but the end result of all
this investment is profound. A small group of large donors is
funding the vetting and selection of judges, and funding the
campaigns for their confirmation, and funding the litigants who
present cases to them, and funding a swarm of front-group amici
who provide amplification of the donors' message and an
illusion of broad support.

V. Results at the Court

Mired in dark-money influence, the Supreme Court has become
a reliable ally for corporate and Republican partisan
interests. Professional observers know it. As renowned New York
Times columnist Linda Greenhouse reluctantly concluded, it is
``impossible to avoid the conclusion that the Republican-
appointed majority is committed to harnessing the Supreme Court
to an ideological agenda.'' \79\ Her sentiment is not unique.
Veteran court watcher Norm Ornstein has written that the
Supreme Court ``is polarized along partisan lines in a way that
parallels other political institutions and the rest of society,
in a fashion we have never seen.'' \80\ The New Yorker's
Jeffrey Toobin was blunt in an assessment of Chief Justice
Roberts, comparing Justice Scalia, ``who has embodied judicial
conservatism during a generation of service on the Supreme
Court,'' with Chief Justice Roberts, who ``has served the
interests, and reflected the values, of the contemporary
Republican Party.'' \81\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The hard proof is in the numbers. As I have documented,
from the 2004 through 2017 Terms, the Roberts Court issued
seventy-three five-to-four partisan decisions benefiting big
corporate and Republican donor interests. By partisan, I mean
that it was all Republican appointees making up the five. The
benefits to Republican donor groups are not hard to discern.
They include allowing corporate interests to spend unlimited
money in elections, hobbling pollution regulations, enabling
attacks on minority voting rights, curtailing labor's right to
organize, and restricting workers' ability to challenge
employers in court.\82\ In its 2018 Term, the Court added seven
more of these five-to-four partisan decisions to this
tally.\83\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\82\ Whitehouse, supra note 44.
\83\ See Niolsea v. Preap, 139 S. Ct. 954 (2019); Bucklew v.

Common Cause, 139 S. Ct. 2484 (2019).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this run of now eighty partisan five-to-four cases (and
counting), something else quite telling took place. The
Republican majority routinely broke traditionally conservative
legal principles, such as respect for precedent, ``minimalism''
in the scope of their decision, or ``originalist'' reading of
the Constitution. The Justices in these bare partisan
majorities even went on remarkable fact-finding expeditions,
violating core traditions of appellate adjudication that leave
fact-finding to lower courts.\84\ (It added no luster to this
effort that the facts they found were false.) \85\ The
consistent measure across these decisions is not traditional
doctrines of conservative jurisprudence; it is the interests
that win.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A results-oriented judiciary is anathema to our Founders'
vision. A judiciary independent of the political branches, and
with justice as its end rather than political gains for
factions, is fundamental to our constitutional democracy. As
Montesquieu put it, ``There is no liberty, if the power of
judging be not separated from the legislative and executive
powers.'' \86\ But corporate and partisan special interests are
purposefully eroding that fundamental ideal to win this array
of victories, and the Court seems content to be shepherded down
that path. Some of these victories go beyond donor interests
just pocketing a win in a particular case; the most dangerous
victories actually tilt the political or legal or regulatory
playing fields in favor of the donor interests in ways that
will enable streams of future victories.

It is perhaps not a coincidence that polls show the
public's faith in the courts receding. In one poll, only
thirty-seven percent responded that they have ``a great deal''
or ``quite a lot'' of confidence in the Supreme Court.\87\ By
seven to one, Americans have reported in polling the belief
that they are less likely before the Justices of this Court to
get a fair shot against a corporation compared to vice
versa.\88\ That ought to be a hazard light flashing for the
Court.

VI. Proposed Solutions: Bringing Transparency to the Judiciary

Millions of dollars in dark money have no business coursing
through the judicial nomination and selection process, or
funding litigants and so-called ``friend of the Court.'' All
this coordinated, anonymous funding creates an odor of rot, and
it risks lasting damage to the institution of the Court.
Congress can take steps to stop the erosion of confidence and
restore the Court to its proper, constitutionally prescribed
lane. While some have called for dramatic and sweeping
structural change--like imposing term limits, or adding seats
to the Court--a logical first step is to shine the light of
greater transparency and accountability into the Court.\89\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\89\ See Supreme Court Justice Term Limits: Where 2020 Democrats

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the political branches, we require transparency as a
safeguard. Congress and the Executive Branch have extensive
reporting requirement: The Lobbying Disclosure Act provides
insight into who is influencing the legislative and rulemaking
processes; \90\ the Federal Election Campaign Act mandates

By comparison to th eother branches the judiciary is
largely a black box. It's not just that hidden donor lurk
behind amici seeking to influence courts, or that groups like
JCN need not disclose the donors behind political campaigns for
judges; loopholes also allow Supreme Court justices and Federal
judges to avoid disclosing travel and hospitality perk. Judges
are nominally covered by the Ethics in Government Act, but
judicial disclosures as implemented by the regulations of the
Judicial Conference, are the least comprehensive and
effective.\93\ We would never have known of Justice Scalia's
all-expenses-paid hunting vacation, except that he died on that
vaca-tion so it made the news.\94\

For a branch of government without either force or purse,
for one that bases its authority on its legitimacy, it's a
mess. If conflicts of interest lurk behind the millions of
dollars in anonymous money, it could produce reputational
crisis for the Court. Legislation that I propose would go a
long way to protect against those potential conflicts through
the sunlight of public disclosure. Not for nothing did Supreme
Court Justice Louis Brandeis say that ``sunlight is the best
disinfectant.'' \95\

It is hard to predict what true transparency would
disclose, but the worst scenario is that a small cabal of
special interest funders anonymously pays to (a) select the
Justices, (b) campaign for their confirmation, (c) have cases
strategically brought before the Court, (d) flood the Court
with an echo chamber of scripted amici, and (e) fund elaborate
travel and hospitality for the agreeable Justices. Ample
evidence suggests the worst-case scenario may not be far from
reality. So here are some proposed repairs for various danger
areas.

A. Anonymous Amici Curiae

Amicus curiae briefs, written by non-parties for the
purpose of providing information, expertise, insight or
advocacy, have surged in both volume and influence in the past
decade. Supreme Court and circuit court opinions often adopt
language and arguments from amicus briefs.\96\ During the
Supreme Courts 2014 term, it received 781 amicus briefs, an
increase of over 800% from the 1950s and a 95% increase from
1995.\97\ From 2008 to 2013, the Supreme Court cited amicus
briefs 606 times in 417 opinions.\98\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\96\ See Paul M. Collins Jr., Pamela C. Corley, & Jesse Hamner, The
Influence of Amicus Curiae Brieff on U.S. Supreme Court Opinion
Content, 49 L. & Soc'y. Rev. 917. 917 (2015) (finding ``the justices
adopt language from amicas briefs based primarily on the quality of the
briefs argument, the level of repetition in the brief, the ideological
position advocated in the brief, and the identity of the amicus'').

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anricus briefs are an increasingly powerful advocacy tool
for special interest group. When those interest groups lobby
Congress, they face stringent financial disclose requirements;
\99\ no similar requirements exist for this form of judicial
lobbying.

address, principal place of business, amount of any contribution of
more than $5,000 to the lobbying activities of the registrant, and
approximate percentage of equitable ownership in the client (if any) of
any foreign entity . . . 1A.'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Janus v. AFSCME \100\ (and its precursor, Fredrichs v.
California Teachers Association) \101\ presents a textbook
example of coordinated, dark-money judicial Jobbying in a case
with massive political implications.\102\ The case garnered
over seventy-five amicus briefs, including many opposing the
1ight of public- sector labor union to collect fees from non-
union members. Many of these briefs were by amicus group with
fonding from the same source: The conservative Lynde and Harry
Bradley Foundation, which has a stated goal of "reduc[ing] the
size and power of public sector unions.'' \103\ None of this
information was disclosed in either case to the Court or the
parties. Instead, it fell to the diligent later research of
transparency groups, using what public data is available, to
document this web of influence with the Bradley Foundation at
its heart. \104\ While the Court in Friedrichs deadlocked at
four-to-four becanse of the death of Justice Scalia, the
radical right was right away ready with a new case in Janus.
With Justice Gorsuch confirmed, the Court by a vote of five-to-
four overturned forty years of settled law and undermined
public sector unions' ability to engage in political advocacy.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Many of the amici in both Janus and Seila law claim status
as ``social welfare'' organizations and thereby keep their
donor list private.\108\ Without knowledge of the common
funding, one might consider thirteen amicus brief, to present a
broad outpouring of support; once the common funding becomes
apparent, it suggests an artificial echo chamber manufactured
by a small cabal of self-interested entities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\108\ See Bullock v. Internal Revenue Serv., 401 F. Supp. 3d 1144,
1159 (D. Mont. 2019) (invalidating a 2018 Internal Revenue Service rule
that permitted 50l(c)(4) ``social-welfare'' organizations to keep their
donor lists private).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Judges and parties should know who is trying to influence
the outcome in their case, but disclosure rules are woefully
inadequate for today's dark-money fueled legal advocacy.
Supreme Court Rule 37(6) requires only that amicus briefs:

[I]ndicate whether counsel for a party authored the brief in
whole or in part and whether such counsel or a party made a
monetary contribution intended to fund the preparation or
submission of the brief, and shall identify every person other
than the amicus curiae, its members, or its counsel, who made
such a monetary contribution.\109\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\109\ Sup. Ct. R. 37(6).

The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure have a similar
disclosure requirement,\110\ but these rules allow for easy
evasion. A group like the Bradley Foundation can fund dozens of
organizations to participate as amici in a case. As long as the
money is not directed to the ``preparation or submission'' of a
particular brief (which may be taken to mean merely printing
and mailing costs), the amicus need not tell the Court where it
gets its money. The real interests lie back in the shadows,
while their front groups--often groups with anodyne names that
belie their true purposes--create an illusory chorus of
support.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\110\ Fed. R. App. P. 29(a)(4)(E).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Worse, the rule is inconsistently applied. In 2018, the
Court rejected an amicus brief funded through a GoFundMe
campaign, with most donors giving ten or hundreds of
dollars.\111\ At the same time the Supreme Court routinely
accepts amicus brief from the United States Chamber of
Commerce. The Chamber refuses to disclose its funding; indeed
the anonymity of Chamber membership in a selling-point for
corporation seeking to influence policy and the courts without
as associating their names with the often-toxic positions of
the Chamber.\112\ It is difficult to conjure any valid reason
to reject one brief because an individual who donated $50 to
the effort did not disclose her identity, while accepting
another whose corporate donor in the millions of dollars remain
anonymous.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This discrepancy seemed so obvious that I wrote to the
Supreme Court to suggest that its disclosure rule should be
changed.\113\ Responding for the Court, Clerk of the Court
Scott Harris wrote, ``The language of Rule 37.6 strikes a
balance . . . . While your letter suggests that non-disclosure
of donor or member lists ['/favors `well-heeled' amici, it is
just as likely to protect organizations that advocate for the
disadvantaged or unpopular causes. See, e.g., NAACP v. Alabama,
357 U.S. 449 461 (1958 recognizing right of AACP not to provide
membership lists where disclosure might lead to retribution and
could chill group activity).''\114\

The Court's response was troubling in two ways. First, it
draws a false if not outright offensive equivalence between
Alabama NAACP members at risk of physical violence during the
Civil Rights era and large corporate interests seeking to bend
the law anonymously to their advantage.\115\ Second, the Court
did require the disclosure of the small donors, who were the
one much more comparable to the ordinary AACP members protected
in the Alabama case. The Court's unwillingness to look behind
these hidden big-money influence campaigns runs contrary to
longstanding precedent that disfavors anonymity in judicial
proceedings.\116\ It would not be difficult to honor that
precedent and fashion a rule of disclosure that allows an
exception for true associational threats of violence, had the
Court wished.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\115\ See, Dale E. Ho, NAACP v. Alabama and False Symmetry in the
Disclosure Debate, 15 N.Y.U. J. Legis. & Pub. Pol'y 405, 433 (2012)
(``[A]pplying NAACP v. Alabama's holding in a formally symmetrical
manner to the relatively powerful . . . without regard to context may
undetermine rather than affirn the values underlying that decision.'').
\116\ See, e.g., United States v. Microsoft Corp., 56 F.3d 1448,
1464 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (finding that a lower court erred when granting
the `` `rare dispensation' of anonymity against the world'' when it
allowed an amicus to file a brief anonymously, and that ``the court has
`a judicial duty to iuquire into the circumstnnces of particular cases
to determine whether the dispensation is warranted' ''); Doe v. Frank,
951 F.2d 320, 324 (11th Cir. 1992) (``A plaintiff should be permitted
to proceed anonymously only in those exceptional cases involving
matters of a highly sensitive and personal nature, real danger of
physical harm, or where the injury litigated against would be incurred
as a result of the disclosure of the plaintiff's identity. The risk
that a plaintiff may suffer some embarrassment is not enough.''); Babak
A. Rastgoufard. Note, Pay Attention to That Green Curtain: Anonymity
and the Courts, 53 Case W. Res. L. Rev. 1009 (2003).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A legislative solution to this problem is the AMICUS
(Assessing Monetary Influence in the Courts of the United
States) Act. This very limited legislation would require
disclosure by repeat players in the influence game--those who
file three or more amicus briefs in the United States Supreme
Court or the Federal courts of appeal during a calendar year.
Disclosure would be required only of these groups' big-dollar
funders, those who contributed three percent or more of the
entity's gross annual revenue or over $100,000. In addition,
the bill would prohibit covered amicus brief filers from making
gifts or providing travel or hospitality to judges, akin to
current restrictions on legislative lobbying.\117\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\117\ See, 2 U.S.C. 1613 (2018).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Judicial Travel and Hospitality

Another means of influence is the ``soft'' lobbying of
gifts and travel. Supreme Court travel paid for by others is
not infrequent. Reporting by the nonpartisan Center for Public
Integrity and by the Washington Post revealed that the nine
Supreme Court Justice received over 365 trips paid for by
outside groups from 2011 to 2014.\118\ Unlike the vulgar and
immediate quid pro quo exchange of a thing of value for a
specific judicial outcome in a particular case, soft lobbying
plays the long game of mutual habituation and good will through
more decorous activities like travel, wbicb happen to avail
access to the donors and their intermediaries. The long game is
well known to Leonard Leo, his corporate cabal, and the savvy
repeat players who represent them.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are myriad unreported ways interests can cultivate
the good will of the Court. Linda Greenhouse described a recent
Federalist Society gala as sending a message from the corporate
donor community to the Justices: ``We've been here for you, and
we expect you to be here for us. If you want to come back,
don't disappoint us.'' \119\ Current judicial travel and gift
disclosure requirements do not provide enough sunlight into
these relationships.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
While the Ethics in Government Act requires judges to
provide some financial disclosure, judges and Justices are not
required to identify the exact dollar value of the
reimbursement, and they are exempted entirely from reporting
any gifts in the form of ``food, lodging, or entertainment
received as personal hospitality.'' \120\ The Executive Branch
personal hospitality exemption is limited to ``hospitality
extended for a nonbusines purpose by an individual, not a
corporation or organization, at the personal residence of or on
property or facilities owned by that individual or the
individual's family''; \121\ the Senate's is virtually
identical, and is commonly understood to be an exception for
old friends and family.\122\

The death of Antonin Scalia demonstrated the difference for
Justices. Justice Scalia was a well-known traveler, reporting
258 trips paid for by private sponsors over eleven years.\123\
The $700-per-night accommodations at the West Texas hunting
lodge where Justice Scalia died were paid by John Poindexter,
owner of a corporate defendant in an age discrimination
lawsuit, Hinga v. MIC Group,\124\ that the Supreme Court the
year before refused to hear,\125\ to the company's
advantage.\126\ This all-expenses-paid hunting trip with a
litigant was treated as personal hospitality. It seems fair to
require that judges and Justices make the same disclosures that
elected officials do. The Judicial Travel Accountability Act
would require judicial officers' financial disclosure
statements to include the dollar amount of transportation,
lodging, and meal expense reimbursements and gifts, as well as
a detailed description of any meetings and events attended. It
would align judicial disclosures with disclosures required in
the other branches. This legislation has bipartisan support and
has been introduced in both houses of Congress.\127\

C. Supreme Court Transparency

The Supreme Court is such an opaque institution that the
public has no idea whom the Justices meet with in their
chambers. Recent reports show why that information matters. In
October 2019, Justices Alita and Kavanaugh met with
representatives of the National Organization for Marriage
(NOM).\128\ NOM is a political advocacy group with both
50l(c)(3) and 50l(c)(4) not-for-profit corporate status.\129\
It uses that dual status to oppose same-sex marriage
initiatives in Federal and State legislatures and in the
courts,\130\ promoting ``an understanding of marriage as the
union of one man and one woman.'' \131\ In this instance, NOM
was an amicus curiae in three consolidated cases then pending,
which presented the issue whether the Civil Rights Act
protected against discrimination based on sexual
orientation.\132\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is a fair question whether Justices should even take
such meetings with amici.\133\ At a minimum, those meetings
should be disclosed. If the disclosures show patterns
suggesting bias, or might influence a recusal motion, or appear
to tread close to ex parte meetings, further action may be
appropriate. But no disclosure is required. We know the
Justices met with these advocates only because of a social
media post from NOM President Brian C. Brown.\134\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most judges take great care to avoid even the appearance of
an ex parte contact during pending litigation. To be sure, NOM
was a friend of the court, not a party to the litigation. But
it would seem fair for parties litigating an issue to know if
their opponents among the amici are getting a special audience
with two of the Justices deciding their case.
Similarly, the Associated Press recently reported that the
Supreme Court can be rented for private events.\135\ The
Supreme Court's website says nothing about such a service, but
again thanks to social media we know that for a fee, and with
the sponsorship of a Justice, the Court's premises are
available for hire. No surprise, the Federalist Society,
sponsored by Justice Alito, held an event at the Court in July
2018.\136\ The Court refuses to disclose either the groups that
rent the Court or the sponsoring Justices. According to court
spokeswoman Kathy Arberg, ``The court does not maintain public
records of organizations holding events.'' \137\ If a Justice
were sponsoring an event for a litigant, or regularly sponsored
events for particular amici curiae, it would seem that other
litigants and the public ought to know.

\137\ Sherman, supra note 135.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Simple legislation would make all this information public.
The official calendars of the Justices and a list of private
events with sponsoring Justices could be made public by the
Court after an appropriate interval. The Justices could still
meet with whomever they choose, and sponsor groups for events
they support, but they would do so knowing their choices will
become public. For an institution whose authority is grounded
in its public legitimacy, it is far better to be open with the
public than not.

D. Supreme Court Records

Currently, no law provides for the preservation of Supreme
Court Justices' papers. The Federal Records Act specifically
excludes the Supreme Court, and the Justice's papers are
considered private property rather than public records.\138\ As
The New Yorker's Jill Lepore wrote in 2014:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\138\ Federal Records Act of 1950 (FRA), 44 U.S.C. 3101 (2018).

The decision whether to make these documents available is
entirely at the discretion of the Justices and their heirs and
executors. They can shred them; they can bum them; they can use
them as placemats. Texts vanish; e-mails are deleted. The Court
has no policies or guidelines for secretaries and clerks about
what to keep and what to throw away. Some Justices have
destroyed virtually their entire documentary trail; others have
made a point of tossing their conference notes. ``Operation
Frustrate the Historians,'' Hugo Black's children called it, as
the sky filled with ashes the day they made their bonfire.\139\

Given the life tenure and extraordinary power to shape
American law that comes with a seat on the Supreme Court of the
United States, there is a public interest in public access to
Supreme Court records.
Following the model provided by the Presidential Records
Act, which ensures public access to presidential records,\140\
my Supreme Court Records Act would make Supreme Court records
the public property of the United States; place the
responsibility for the custody and management of records with
the incumbent Justice and, upon the Justice's retirement the
Archivist of the United States; allow an incumbent Justice to
dispose of records that no longer have administrative;
historical, informational, or evidentiary value, subject to the
approval of the Archivist; and establish a process for
restriction of public access to these records.

E. DISCLOSE Act for Judicial Nominations

Judicial nominations and confirmations look more and more
like political campaigns. Millions of dollars of dark money
flow into social media, televion, and radio advertising
supporting and opposing nominees. The ads target States whose
Senators could be swayed on the nomination. It is political
tradecraft, deployed for politicaI purpose, and all of it ought
to be regulated like tbe political campaign spending that it
is.
Two things need to happen for effective regulation of
political spending on judicial nominations. First, the Federal
Election Campaign Act (FECA) needs to cover these judicial
nomination campaign so the spending is reported to the Federal
Election Commission.\141\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\141\ Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), 52 U.S.C. 30101
(2018) (currently defin1ng the term ``candidate'' as ``an individual
who seeks nomination for election, or election, to Federal office,''
but not including judicial nominees.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Second, the law must deal with the post-Citizens United
identity-laundering devices available to secretive donors.
Existing FECA discloses do not reach behind the nominal donor
to give a true picture of who's behind political spending.\142\
So, we need a remedy like the DISCLOSE (Democracy Is
Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending in Elections) Act
\143\ to unveil the real parties behind political advertising,
who are now hiding behind shell corporations, donor trusts, and
50l(c)(4) organizations.

A Judicial DISCLOSE Act, which I plan to introduce, would
require groups that that run political advertizements
supporting or opposing Federal judicial nominations to disclose
their biggest donors. The bill is modeled after the DISCLOSE
Act, which would end the plague of dark money in our campaign
finance system by requiring outside groups to disclose their
donors to the FEC.

VII. Conclusion

We must be clear-eyed about the hurdles these reforms face.
Enormous effort has been put by large and powerful interests
into a fifty-year project to capture the courts. These
interests seek to maintain, and indeed further en-trench, the
corporate-friendly outcomes into which they have invested hun-
dreds of millions of dollars. Transparency is inconsistent with
their scheme. They will fight.
This is a fight worth having. Dark money is a plague
anywhere in our political system. Citizens deprived of knowing
the identities of political force are deprived of power,
treated a pawns to be pushed around by anonymous money and
message. Dark money encourages bad behavior, creating the
``tsunami of slime'' that has washed into our political
discourse. Dark money corrupts and distorts politics. Bad as
all that is, dark money around courts is even worse. The
chances of corruption and scandal explode. The very notion that
courts can be captured undercuts the credibility upon which
courts depend. It is surprising that the Judiciary has not come
to its own defense in these matters, but that makes it our job.
As Justice Brandeis also said, ``If we desire respect for
the law we must first make the law respectable.'' \144\ The
legislation I have proposed here would be an important--indeed
necessary--first step to bringing a respectable transparency to
our judiciary.

Senator Whitehouse. Mr. Chair, the Supreme Court vacancy
created by Justice Ginsburg's death makes this hearing salient
as well as poignant. To understand the forces out to control
the court, we must first look back.
Decades ago, business interests, spooked by upheaval in
American society, needed a plan. Powerful men objected to the
rise of the anti-war, environmental, civil rights, and women's
rights movements.
Polluters dreaded accountability for the damage they were
doing to our air and water. Tobacco interests dreaded
accountability for the deaths they were causing. Corporate
interests felt threatened.
So, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce turned to a prominent
lawyer for corporate and tobacco interests. His recommendation?
Corporate interests must get strongly involved in politics with
a focus on controlling America's courts.
The lawyer's name was Lewis Powell. Weeks later, Powell
went on to the Supreme Court where, in 1978, he led the 5 to 4
decision that first required a role for corporations in
American politics, a role which has grown into, often,
corporate dominance of American politics.
For big special interests, the rewards of an amenable
judiciary are immense. A well-stocked bench can deliver things
elected Members of Congress would never vote for, such as
letting corporations spend unlimited money, even nowadays
anonymous untraceable dark money in our elections or undoing
the Voting Rights Act. The prizes are enormous and big special
interests have the stamina to play the long game, which they
did.
So, fast forward 40-some years from Lewis Powell's memo.
Today, a dark money-funded private organization, the Federalist
Society, has a dominant role in the selection of Federal
judges.
Another dark money-funded private organization, the
Judicial Crisis Network, takes anonymous donations, some as
much as $17 million, to fund political ad campaigns for
nominees' confirmations.
Other dark money-funded private organizations troll the
country for plaintiffs of convenience to bring cases before the
court that advance the big donors' agenda, and an obliging
court majority relaxes standing requirements to hear those
preferred cases.
Dark money-funded organizations then appear at the court in
chorus by the orchestrated dozen as amici curiae, ``friends of
the court.''
It is big. Last year, the Washington Post published an
investigation showing Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society at
the center of a sweeping web of groups fueled by at least a
quarter billion dollars of dark money out to control the
Federal judiciary.
This has the earmarks of a massive covert operation,
screened behind dark money secrecy, run by a small handful of
big special interests against their own country.
In occasional glimpses, we see the same family fortunes and
corporate interests, suggesting a common scheme. We see overlap
and funding sources, staff, board members, lawyers, mail drops,
and office locations. We see cutouts, front groups, false
narratives, hidden funding. It has the trade craft of a covert
op.
Behind all that mess lurks a dark money-funded hothouse to
incubate and propagate legal theories that give intellectual
cover to the donors' agenda, and we don't know much about
travel and hospitality emoluments for justices because they are
less transparent than the legislative and executive branches.
A quarter billion dollars is a lot of money. You don't
spend that kind of money unless you expect something for it.
So, look at climate change. The International Monetary Fund
calculates the U.S. subsidy for fossil fuel at $600 billion--
billion with a b--per year.
So, if you can get five Republican appointees onto the
Supreme Court, knock back the Clean Power Plan, and stall
progress on climate change for several years, the monetary
value of that one delay could be hundreds of billions of
dollars.
The capture scheme is an investment with perhaps a thousand
to one return. Climate is a target, but there are many other
issues targeted by this operation.
Voter suppression, where Leonard Leo, via the so-called
Honest Elections Project, a rebrand of the Judicial Education
Project, sister organization of the Judicial Crisis Network, is
creating, as The Guardian reported on, quote, ``a system where
conservative donors have an avenue to both oppose voting rights
and appoint judges to back that effort.''
Destroying Obamacare, with a case to be argued in less than
two months in the Supreme Court. Breaking the independence of
regulatory agencies under the confected unitary executive
theory. Neutering and crippling the civil jury to protect
mighty corporate interests from the indignity of equal
treatment before the law in courtroom.
The grand prize, the evil that makes other evils possible,
a First amendment right to anonymous dark money in politics.
Big special interests are already asserting that theory in
anticipation.
As this anonymously-funded apparatus grasps for this
Supreme Court vacancy, there are big questions for Congress to
answer.
Why does so much special interest dark money surround the
court? Why have there been over 80 partisan 5 to 4 decisions
under Chief Justice Roberts giving victories to big Republican
donor interests?
Why has the court been so feckless about proper disclosure
from these groups? Are the various front groups in fact one
large common scheme?
What and who are its goals? Whoever is behind this scheme
what business do they have before the court?
Drill down. Follow the money. Who gave two $17 million plus
donations to the Judicial Crisis Network to fund political
campaigns against Judge Garland and for Judge Gorsuch, and to
prop up Judge Kavanaugh's troubled confirmation?
Add to that another newly disclosed $15 million donation.
From whom? What business did these donors or this repeat donor
have before the court?
Who are the anonymous donors colluding with Leonard Leo to
funnel that quarter billion dollars into this scheme and what
do they expect in return?
This, obviously, matters. A baked-in bias within the
Federal judiciary for special interests scheming behind an
array of dark money front groups is a rotten situation that
inflicts long-term harm on our judiciary.
For those who say both sides are to blame, great. Join me
in fixing it. Let us bring transparency to judicial
nominations, amicus briefs, and judges' gifts and hospitality
no matter who is paying.
Mr. Chair, the sooner we clean up this mess, the sooner
courts can escape the grimy swamps of dark money influence and
return to their proper place in the broad and sunlit uplands of
earned public trust.
Thank you, sir, for taking on this unpleasant but necessary
challenge, and thank you for allowing me the opportunity to
present these remarks today.

Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you for your long-time work
on this very important issue and others related to the
integrity of the judicial process and system, and I thank you
for your testimony today.
Mr. Jordan. Mr. Chair?
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Who seeks to be recognized?
Yes, the gentleman is recognized.
Mr. Jordan. The Senator is not going to take questions?
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. No.
Mr. Jordan. I think the last time the Senator was in front
of the Oversight Committee he took questions from the Members.
I mean, he came in here and leveled all kinds of accusations
against Republicans, and is not going to take any questions
from us?
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Well, as the gentleman knows, it is
our custom and tradition to not pose questions to our fellow
colleagues when they appear as Witnesses.
Mr. Jordan. The good Senator from Rhode Island took
questions from us in the Oversight Committee just not too long
ago because I was in that Committee and asked him some
questions.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Well, it was not compulsory, and I
guess the Chair of the Committee allowed it to happen.
Mr. Jordan. Does the Senator not want to take our
questions?
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Yeah, our agreement with the
Senator is that he would not take questions. That was our
mutual understanding along with the Subcommittee.
So, with that, the gentleman has departed and we now have
our second esteemed panel that is ready to go.
[Pause.]
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. All right. So, at this time we will
reconvene to hear the testimony of our second panel. I will now

TESTIMONY OF TOM GINSBURG

Mr. Ginsburg. Thank you very much, Chair Johnson, Ranking
Member Roby, and all the Members of the Subcommittee for the
opportunity to discuss today a topic I have been researching
for many years.
My work is on the origins, maintenance, and decline of
constitutional democracy around the world, and work has taken
me to dozens of countries.
Of course, I appear before you today in a time when
Americans are worried about the quality of our own democracy
and when the appointment of a Supreme Court justice is, again,
going to be a major topic of discussion during our presidential
election campaign. It is a good time to be thinking about the
role of courts in democracy and how to ensure that our high-
quality judiciary can fulfill its responsibilities under the
Constitution.
At the same time, it is a moment of some risk. Major
battles over judicial appointments risk politicizing the courts
and depriving them of the legitimacy that is essential to their
function.
This is not just a concern of scholars and journalists and
court watchers, or those who have been tracking signs of
democratic erosion in the United States. Much more importantly,
it is a concern of the American people themselves. This
perception of an independent judiciary that can constrain
executive power is low and in decline on both sides of the
political aisle.
Now, it is my view that even an old democracy like the
United States can learn from the dynamics of democratic
backsliding and democratic resilience around the world, and one
of the things we observed in the context of democratic erosion
is what might be called political capture of the judiciary.
In recent decades, for many reasons, courts have become
very important in the politics of many countries, and this
means that leaders who wish to take over their political
systems first look to the courts as a first step in trying to
end electoral competition and this has occurred in countries
like Venezuela, Turkey, Hungary, even Poland.
At the same time, we also see countries in which the courts
play a critical role in saving constitutional democracy in
places like Colombia and Sri Lanka.
So, in my view, this outside information is relevant as we
think about our own judiciary.
Now, it is also my view and finding election campaigns,
presidential elections over judicial appointments is a
distortion of our democracy, and so a key objective for
Congress in the coming years must be to reduce the stakes of
appointments to the Federal bench. Lowering the temperature of
judicial appointments will be good for our democracy, good for
our judiciary as well.
One way to do this would be to regularize the appointments
process, and many other countries do this. Note that current
discussions are not just about what kind of justice should
replace Justice Ginsburg, but the very procedure by which that
person will be nominated and confirmed, and this is, obviously,
not healthy. Procedures must be set in advance.
In fact, I don't see in the current moment any principal
stopping point in our partisan escalation. We could soon be in
a situation where all appointments to the Supreme Court, maybe
even all Federal courts, could only be made in periods when the
presidency and Senate were in the hands of the same party, and
this would lead to episodic rushes to confirm judges who are
ever younger, less experienced, for the public to evaluate. Not
good for the country, the court, or our democracy.
Now, it is true procedure is, largely, in control of the
Senate's internal rules but it doesn't mean that Congress
couldn't pass a statute seeking to regularize the procedure in
terms of timelines, providing for outside vetting, and doing
other things like introducing qualifications for Federal judges
such as practice experience, which has arisen in a small number
of recent nominations.
Chair mentioned the lack of a code of ethics to the Supreme
Court, which is also something that could be addressed. All
these things would give the public confidence that the
procedure and standards of filling the judiciary and the people
taking those jobs are not simply being manipulated on a
partisan basis. So, I would like to see that.
I would also like to see us redirect the courts to
fundamental issues of protecting our democracy. Right now, the
dominant image of the courts is this kind of a referee between
the two parties, famously captured by Justice Roberts in his
own confirmation hearing in which he said the job of the judge
was to call balls and strikes.
The problem is in a polarized era where the players
themselves are picking the ump, each side is trying to get the
calls sort of shaded to their side and sending more and more
questions up to that umpire. My view is that most political
decisions should be in the hands of democratic processes, and
so the important role for courts is to preserve those
processes.
Our courts do well in some core democratic areas like
freedom of speech, freedom of association. They do less well in
areas like the Voting Rights Act, and that is where I would
like to see Congress instruct courts to give the right to vote
maximum effect and to undo many of the efforts to suppress the
vote that we have seen since the passage of the case of Shelby
County.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chair, and I look forward to your
questions.
[The statement of Tom Ginsburg follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you, Professor Ginsburg.
Mr. Shapiro, you may begin.

TESTIMONY OF ILYA SHAPIRO

Mr. Shapiro. Thank you, Chair Johnson, Ranking Member Roby,
distinguished Members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for this
opportunity to discuss judicial independence and the rule of
law.
Judicial independence is, of course, an important part of
our constitutional structure, allowing the third branch of the
Federal government to check the others. Those checks and
balances maintain the separation of powers, which, in turn,
protects our liberty by preventing the concentration of power.
Now, this hearing's subtitle implies that something called
court capture is a threat to the rule of law. Yet, I am not
sure that the courts have been captured or even what such a
capture would look like.
Is it simply that President Trump has gotten many judges
confirmed? Although this administration has had particular
success with circuit judges, 53 confirmed with no remaining
vacancies, its 216 article 3 judges represent only about a
quarter of all such judges and less than a quarter of the
authorized 870 article 23 judgeships.
By comparison, President Carter had 262 judges confirmed in
one term, including 59 circuit judges, while President George
H.W. Bush had 193.
If President Trump loses his bid for reelection, his total
will not be much higher than the first President Bush's and
significantly lower than that of President Carter, for whom
Congress created many new judgeships to fill.
If President Trump is reelected, even assuming the
Republicans keep the Senate, it is unlikely that his two-term
total would be significantly higher than our last two
presidents--George W. Bush with 327, Obama with 329.
For one thing, there are currently only about 60 vacancies,
mostly for District judges in States where democratic Senators
have refused to negotiate any sort of deals, preferring to
leave their States shorthanded.
In other words, if the judiciary has been captured, it is
the sort of capture we see under every president, and probably
overstated, given the District court nominees in States like
New York, where the democratic Senators have, indeed, made
deals.
Maybe the nominees themselves have been captured by
particular interests. This can happen with elected State judges
and, historically, judicial politics have, indeed, been swayed
by interests ranging from plantation slavery to the railroads,
manufacturers, to New Deal allegiances.
Senator Whitehouse's own chosen Federal judge, John
McConnell of the District of Rhode Island, was a well-known
personal injury trial lawyer who gave generously to left-wing
causes.
There is no indication that this administration's nominees
are beholden to the entertainment or hotel industries in which
Donald Trump plied his trade before coming down that golden
escalator.
To his credit, the President has let the White House
Counsel's Office run the show. Senators will occasionally
insist on their local favorites, but the ration of
intellectually rigorous and independent nominees to
establishmentarians is exceedingly high and the result has been
this President's biggest success, with judges of the same
caliber as those whom conservative constitutionalist Ted Cruz
would have picked.
This administration has surpassed even George W. Bush in
picking committed and youthful originalists, particularly in
the Circuit courts. Former White House counsel Don McGahn likes
to say that rather than outsourcing judicial selections to the
Federalist Society or anyone else, he had in-sourced the
operation, meaning that his team, which was leaner than in
previous administrations, all understood the need for solid
judges with a record of accomplishment and demonstrated
commitment to originalism and textualism.
That is why it is no surprise that so many of President
Trump's nominees are already superstars and why Democrats have
tried to smear them in various ways.
Senator Dianne Feinstein said about Seventh Circuit Judge
Amy Coney Barrett, now a finalist for Justice Ginsburg's seat,
that ``the dogma lives loudly within you,'' which sounds like a
rejected Star Wars line.
Fifth Circuit Judge Don Willett was assailed for humorous
tweets. D.C. Circuit Judge Neomi Rao and Second Circuit Judge
Steven Menashi were attacked for their pretty standard
conservative or libertarian collegiate writings.
California Senators Feinstein and Kamala Harris tried
especially hard to block their home State's Patrick Bumatay,
who became the first openly gay Ninth Circuit judge and First
Circuit judge of Filipino descent.
Indeed, Democratic Senators have used every trick in the
book to stop or slow this high-quality judicial confirmation
train, which Harry Reid eliminated for the lower courts in
2013.
So, they forced more cloture votes than all previous
presidencies combined. Nearly 80 percent of Trump's judicial
nominees have faced cloture votes, including many who are
confirmed with upwards of 90 votes.
In comparison, about 3 percent of Obama's nominees faced
cloture votes and fewer than 2 percent in the previous five
presidencies.
To put it another way, Trump's 216 article 3 judicial
appointees have received more than 4,600 no votes, while
Obama's 329 got 2,039. Trump's judges have received nearly half
of all no votes in U.S. history, in fact.
One final statistic. The average Democrat has voted against
nearly half of all Trump nominees while the average Republican
voted against fewer than 10 percent of Obama's.
It is a shame that quality nominees are confirmed on party
line votes. We have gotten here because we are at the
culmination of long trends where different legal theories map
on to ideologically sorted parties, as I detail in my new
books, ``Supreme Disorder,'' which actually just came out
today.
None of this is a sign of capture. Political considerations
have always been part of the process.
Thank you, and I welcome your questions, including about
actual threats to judicial independence like court packing.
Thank you.
[The statement of Mr. Shapiro follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Mr. Johnson of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for his
testimony.
Judge Gertner, you may begin.
Judge Gertner. I thank the gentleman for his testimony.

TESTIMONY OF JUDGE NANCY GERTNER (RET.)

Ms. Gertner. Thank you.
Chair Johnson, Ranking Member Roby, and Members of the
Committee, let me start by saying that I don't want to just
memorialize Justice Ginsburg. I was a friend and I, candidly,
mourn her.
I was a Federal judge for 17 years, serving in the District
of Massachusetts. I left the bench to become a full-time
professor of practice at Harvard Law School. I am now teaching
there part time as well as teaching criminal law at Yale Law
School this semester.
My testimony here derives from my judicial experience. My
goal is to be as dispassionate and careful in this testimony as
I know how to be.
I testify today because of my deep concern for the
parties'--the public's growing view of the bench as partisan
and, thus, not meaningfully different from the other branches.
The legitimacy of the courts depends upon the public's
belief in its neutrality. Their faith in the institution
depends upon their trust that it is fully and completely
independent of the political process.
Attacks on the judiciary by our President undermine that
legitimacy and that faith. When the President criticizes
opinions with which he disagrees as coming from Obama or
Clinton judges, he undermines all judges and the institution as
a whole.
That is why Chief Justice Roberts made clear that we don't
have, quote, ``Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or
Clinton judges. We have an extraordinary group of dedicated
judges doing their level best to do equal right to those
appearing before them,'' unquote.
The selection process for Federal judges under the Trump
administration, in my view, undermines the Chief Justice's
observations.
While in the past there have not been Bush I, Bush II,
Clinton, or Obama judges. There are, or at least I fear the
public perceives, that there are, quote, ``Trump judges.''
The administration has explicitly said as much. These are,
after all, quote, ``his'' judges.
The unique judicial selection process has produced them and
the public's perception of Trump judges could undermine the
rest of the bench.
I talk about 28 U.S.C 1404--it is 455(a), which is a
provision of the Judicial Code of the statutes that talks about
not just the reality of bias but the appearance of bias, and my
concern is that how one selects judges for a life-tenured
position may well be as important as who you select. How you
select plays a role in determining the respect with which the
public holds the bench.
While in the past the public understood that the process
was political in the sense that the President nominated the
candidates, one thing was clear. No matter who the President
was, the pipeline for judicial appointments was wide and
bipartisan often.
The range of acceptable views was broad. Candidates, as
Senator Lindsey Graham has said, were in the mainstream of
judicial thought whether they were on the right or the left
side of that stream.
This process has been truncated, partisan, and seems to
depend upon the imprimatur of one organization, directly
affecting the way the public perceives the bench.
Even before the President was sworn in he announced, quote,
``slate of nominees,'' in a way that resonated with the kind of
slate one sees in a judicial election.
It was not an ordinary slate, as Professor Hollis-Brusky
will describe. It was curated by one organization, the
Federalist Society.
In fact, at one point, Leonard Leo was quoted as saying to
the President, ``That is a great idea. You are creating a
brand''--a judicial brand, precisely what casts doubt on the
independence of the judiciary.
In fact, the relationship between the President's nominees
and the Federalist Society has been praised by Orrin Hatch, by
Don McGahn, ``Yes, these are people that have--this is a set of
nominees that have been outsourced to the Federalist Society.''
Contrast that with the statements of other Republican
administrations. William Marshall, in a Federalist Society
panel, said, ``We are now treating elections as if they are
mandates to change the meaning of the Constitution. That is
troubling.''
Professor William Kelley, at the same meeting, said, ``It
seems to license people to do what they otherwise might not do.
It is one thing to have a political view when you come into
office. It is another thing to be told by the election process
that it is okay to apply that political view in your opinions.
Over-politicization of the process provides a license to
judicial nominees to effectuate their choices.''
In short, I am not talking about whether these are
qualified or not. These candidates are qualified. I focus on
the process by which they are selected, what that process
communicates to the public, and the ways in which it undermines
the public's perception of the bench.
If the public believes that one of these nominees are the
arm of one political party, or worse, of a subgroup of that
party, the core faith in an independent judiciary is
undermined.
Thank you.

Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you, Judge Gertner.
Professor Hollis-Brusky, you may begin.

TESTIMONY OF AMANDA HOLLIS-BRUSKY

Ms. Hollis-Brusky. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you to the
Members of this Committee for the opportunity to testify this
afternoon.
My name is Amanda Hollis-Brusky and I am an Associate
Professor of politics at Pomona College. I am also the author
of two books on the Supreme Court and the conservative legal
movement.
In my written testimony, I draw on my own published work as
well as that of other law and court scholars to provide
thorough and detailed answers grounded in research to the
question animating today's hearing.
In my brief remarks this afternoon I want to highlight one
development in particular that threatens to undermine judicial
independence and the rule of law.
That is the growing public perception of a judiciary that
appears to be both driven by partisan politics and captured by
a single interest group.
I will talk about the corrosive effects this has on the
people's perception of the judicial branch as an independent
neutral arbiter of law and of the Constitution.
Our current court is at once more partisan and more divided
than any time in the last 100 years. Since 2010, the Supreme
Court has been strictly divided along party lines, not just
ideological lines, with every justice appointed by a Democratic
President voting more liberally than every justice appointed by
a Republican president, and vice versa.
Far from being the historical norm, this partisan divide is
out of step with traditional patterns of voting and alignment
on the court. It is also the most divided court since the New
Deal court of the 1930s.
In its decisions the current Supreme Court has split or
sharply divided, for example, 5 to 4, on nearly one of every
five decisions it has handed down, and that is the highest rate
of division in 100 years.
This means that more often than not votes on major issues
that affect millions of Americans on health care, housing
discrimination, who gets to get married, gun control,
reproductive rights, the separation of church and State, who
gets to stay in this country, and who gets deported come down
to a single vote, and more often than not, that vote has been 5
to 4 along party lines.
The current partisan divide on the Supreme Court is
amplified by the fact that the five Republican-appointed
justices all have identifiable ties to a single organization:
The Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies.
I read extensively about the Federalist Society and its
influence on the Supreme Court and Republican judicial
selection in my book, ``Ideas With Consequences: The Federalist
Society and the Conservative Counterrevolution.''
For the purposes of this hearing, I will emphasize a single
point about the organization. Over the past three and a half
decades, the Federalist Society has achieved, and I will quote
one of its members here directly, ``A de facto monopoly on the
training, selection, and disciplining of Republican-appointed
judges.''
Over the course of the Trump administration, as I and many
others have documented, this influence has become at once more
visible and more consolidated than ever before.
All of this has consequences for court legitimacy. The
currency of the court, its only real power, is its legitimacy,
its power to persuade we, the people, that its decisions are
legitimate and grounded in law, not grounded in partisan
politics or influenced by interest group politics.
We know from political science that the single greatest
threat to the legitimacy of the judiciary is when the public
begins to believe, and I quote, ``that judges are little more
than politicians in robes.''
When the judiciary is viewed as just another political
institution, people lose faith in the legitimacy of the court.
People lose faith in the Rule of law.
Now, whether or not judges and justices are actually
motivated in their decisions by their partisan allegiances that
doesn't matter, and whether or not the Republican-appointed
judges and justices on the Federal bench, now numbering around
400 in total, are actually influenced by their connections with
and membership in the Federalist Society, that doesn't really
matter either.
What matters is how all of this looks to we, the people.
Research tells us that the appearance of partisan-motivated
voting, the appearance of Federalist Society capture, will harm
the people's faith in and trust in the Federal judiciary.
So what it looks like, how it is perceived by the public,
should matter to anyone who cares about judicial independence
and the Rule of law and it should matter especially to the
Members of this body and the Members of this Committee.
Thank you, and I look forward to hearing your questions.
[The statement of Ms. Hollis-Brusky follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you, Professor Hollis-Brusky.
Votes have been called. I understand it will be three
votes. Since we are in the middle of the first vote, I
recommend that the Witnesses be subjected to questions from
myself and Ms. Roby, at which time we will then recess for the
Members to vote.
I suggest that the Members remain for the second vote and
vote, and then come back to the Committee, whereupon we will
resume questioning of the Witnesses as far as we can get until
it is time to go vote for that third vote.
There being no objection that I have heard, I would now ask
the Ranking Member to consider the request that I extended to
her earlier of allowing our colleague, Sheila Jackson Lee, to
maintain a seat on the podium during the hearing.
Ms. Roby. Mr. Chair, I have no objection. I would like to
note for the record--have no objection to my friend and
colleague joining us here on the dais today.
I would like to note for the record that there is at least
one instance in another Subcommittee where the minority has
made a similar request and not been extended the same courtesy,
and I believe that is very unfortunate.
Welcome, Ms. Sheila Jackson Lee, to the dais today.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Well, if I could assure the Ranking
Member, who has always extended courtesy to me, that courtesy
would always be re-extended to you. We would not be
hypocritical in any way.
Ms. Roby. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. I thank the chair.
With that, we will begin our questions of the first
Witness. We proceed under the five-minute rule. I now recognize
myself for five minutes.
Professor Ginsburg, you have written that the Federal
courts have acquired legitimacy with the public through their
association with historical causes such as the civil rights
movement.
Now, the courts and, particularly, the Supreme Court are
increasingly associated with efforts to dismantle the rights
that once helped secure.
The right to vote, the right to be free from discrimination
because of your age, your gender, your language, or the color
of your skin, the right to control your own body, the right to
clean air and clean water, it has all been rolled back.
Professor Ginsburg, is this trend consistent with your
vision of courts as bulwarks against democratic backsliding?
Mr. Ginsburg. Thank you for the question, Mr. Chair.
Certainly, consistent with my view of the role that courts
should play in terms of facilitating democracy and not reducing
participation, taking actions which are activist in nature and
hurts the majority, and that seems to be what many of the
things you listed would fall under that category.
The fact is, this term activism often gets thrown around,
and I see in my friend Professor Shapiro's testimony even notes
that activism is something more of an epithet than an analytic
tool these days.
The fact is, many of the decisions which have come in
recent years, many of the most consequential decisions can be
described as nothing other than activist attempts to roll back
the administrative State, to reduce the right to vote and to
facilitate free flow of money in our politics. That is my
reading of those decisions.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you.
Judge Gertner, what happens to our democracy when the
judiciary becomes associated with weakening people's basic
rights instead of protecting them?
[No response.]
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. You may unmute yourself, please.
Ms. Gertner. Federal judges are not used to being muted.
Thank you for your question. I think that the role that an
independent judiciary has played in the United States and, I
might add, as an icon for the rest of the world has been the
role of supporting minority rights against the majority
political party, for example.
That was what the carveout was for Brown v. Board of
Education, for the various LGBTQ decisions. When the
majoritarian institutions failed to protect minority rights,
the Supreme Court stepped in.
The view of the court as protecting majority rights,
protecting corporate rights, is a new one and inconsistent with
what it has been in the past.
My concern is not just the direction of the court. My
concern is the perception of the direction of the court. It is
as Professor Ginsburg described and what I have begun to call
the undoing project--the project to undo the rights and the
core principles of the past 40 years on the bench.
So, activism no longer means rejecting--no longer suggests
that rejecting precedent is a bad thing. We now have
literature, particularly from the Federalist Society,
describing the importance of overturning precedent and
overturning settled expectations in the court.
My point before was really more even if one agrees with
that, one has to be troubled by a single-lane pipeline to the
United States Supreme Court and the lower Federal courts, which
is a pipeline that is monitored and controlled by one
organization. Even if you agree with them, that has got to be a
troubling development.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you, Judge.
Professor Hollis-Brusky, what happens to our democracy.
Ms. Roby. Your mic.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. When the judiciary associated with
weakening people's rights is also associated with ideological
and partisan groups funded by groups like the Federalist
Society network?
Ms. Roby. Your mic.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. I am sorry. You didn't hear my
question. I didn't have my mic on, Professor Hollis-Brusky.
What I would like for you to respond to is the question,
what happens to our democracy when a judiciary associated with
weakening people's rights is associated with ideological and
partisan groups funded by groups like the Federalist Society?
Ms. Hollis-Brusky. Thank you for the question.
Under a certain theory of government, it is important to
recognize that the judicial role should be a minimal role. In
fact, this was the same theory of government embraced by people
like Justice Scalia back in the 1980s, judges like J. Harvie
Wilkinson, who believed that judges should exercise restraint,
particularly when it came to the will of the democratic
majority.
So, the role of the judge was to, in most cases whenever
possible, uphold the democratic will, but in those cases where
the Constitution clearly commanded it, to strike down
infringements on minority rights or to hold the democratic
majority accountable to provisions in the Constitution.
Now, this used to be called judicial restraint and the
opposite of that would be judicial activism: A judicial branch
that goes out of its way to overturn long-established
precedent, a judicial branch that moves the law too far too
fast, and a judicial branch that answers questions that are not
asked of it.
So, in my book, ``Ideas With Consequences,'' I talk, in
particular, about the decision in Citizens United and how this
represented a new kind of judicial activism within the
Federalist Society.
The Roberts court answered a question that was not asked of
it and used this decision as a vehicle to further deregulate
campaign finance law, which handcuffs the people's ability to
control the corrosive effects of money in elections.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you. My time has expired.
Next, we will have five minutes of questions from the
gentlelady from Alabama, Congresswoman Roby.
Ms. Roby. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Shapiro, I will give you an opportunity if you want to
respond to any of the other Witnesses' responses to Chair's
questions.
Mr. Shapiro. I appreciate that. Thanks very much.
On the topic of Shelby County, which has been mentioned a
few times, I have a Law Review article called ``Shelby County
and the Vindication of Martin Luther King's Dream.'' I will
send that to your staff to be entered into the record rather
than taking up the oral time for that.
This idea of the Federalist Society, I think, has been
mischaracterized and I want to push back on this idea of a
single-lane pipeline or a dominant interest group because the
Federalist Society isn't an interest group.
It is a network of lawyers and law students. It is a
membership organization. It is much like the American Bar
Association.
In fact, it was formed to be a counterpart to the academy
for law students and to the ABA for practicing lawyers, both of
which had then and probably even more have now a left-wing or
progressive skew.
To be clear, I have been a member of the Federalist Society
for 20 years. In fact, 28 years ago I was a first-year law
student.
It was right about now 20 years ago that I was joining it,
and I have never been asked by anyone at the Federalist Society
to take any position, acknowledge any positions, sign my name
to any statement.
I am constantly asked, however, about how best to frame a
discussion in a particular area of constitutional law or legal
policy, or whether I would be amenable to debating a point I
have made in a recent article with another member of the
Federalist Society.
In fact, the Federalist Society strives to present debates
and otherwise expose students to a wide range of ideas. It is
not a monolith.
In fact, during the same-sex marriage litigation, for
example, law school faculty often refused to engage in the
battle of ideas so the Federalist Society would provide both
speakers including, frequently, I was on the pro same-sex
marriage side--to hold debates.
The Federalist Society counts as members people who apply
many kinds of interpretive methods, from natural law theorists
to libertarians, those who believe in judicial restraint and
those who believe in traditional engagement, textualists and
pragmatists, lovers of Chevron deference, and those who want to
deconstruct the administrative State.
Indeed, Federalist Society member jurists who are
textualists nominated by the same President can disagree, as we
saw this past term in the Bostock case in which Justices
Gorsuch and Kavanaugh argued against each other about the
meaning of title 7 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Of course, that decision gave fuel to the rising so-called
common good constitutionalists. That was criticism by Senator
Josh Hawley of the efficacy of a conservative legal movement
that, in his view, increasingly fails to produce results for
the voters who empower it.
In short, there is no monolith. There is no talking points
or marching orders. I have had many more debates, certainly,
many more productive debates, with other members of the
Federalist Society, as much or more as with the American
Constitution Society or otherwise.
What it is a signaling mechanism to show that you are
unafraid to declare at your law school, because most are very
left leaning, as I said, especially the student bodies, that
you are committed to certain principles, originalism,
textualism, certain modes of interpretation.
This is not about being results oriented. That might be a
bit of projection, perhaps, from some people on the other side.
It is about intellectual rigor and commitment to taking
ideas seriously and the commitment to, indeed, the focus of
this panel: The Rule of law and judicial independence.
Ms. Roby. Mr. Shapiro, some academics and stakeholders have
argued for increased donor disclosure laws, particularly as it
relates to spending by 501(c) organizations. Do you have any
concerns about compelling donor disclosure and how that may
chill free speech?
Mr. Shapiro. I do. I detail some of that in my written
remarks. Just to summarize, going back to NAACP v. Alabama, the
idea that the freedom of speech or independent speech--we are
not even talking about donations or support of particular
candidates or parties--that the State will demand anyone who is
participating in that, certainly, will chill activity.
I work for the Cato Institute. We are a 501(c)(3), not a
(c)(4). Still, we are very jealous of our donors' privacy
because freedom of association and private association are
important constitutional protections.
Ms. Roby. Thank you. My time has expired. I yield back.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. I thank the gentlelady.
We will recess to take votes one and two. We should be back
in probably 30 to 45 minutes, ladies and gentlemen, and we
appreciate your forbearance with us.
[Recess.]
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. The hearing will resume. With that,
we will have five minutes of questions from the gentlelady from
California, Zoe Lofgren.
Ms. Lofgren. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and this has been a very
important hearing, especially given the events of the last few
days, the tragic loss of our Ruth Bader Ginsburg, such a icon
justice, and the hope and future for equal rights. I think back
on all the things that would have been different in my life had
she not been a member of the Supreme Court.
So, I would like to talk about how we maintain and continue
or, in some cases, regain confidence in the Supreme Court, and
I would like to get into the question of all the Witnesses of
ethics.
Right now, the Supreme Court, that Congress has, basically,
left ethics to the court itself. Justices do not disclose if
they are taken on trips, who is paying for various things that
they might enjoy. I am wondering whether you think that should
be part of any steps we take. There has been concern about the
capture of the court and the role that the Federalist Society
plays.
Is Federalist Society also taking justices on trips? I
don't know. Are other groups doing the same thing? Certainly,
if you had a direct financial interest in a case you would
disqualify yourself. You might have an ideological interest in
a case and, yet, be funding justices to go to various trips or
other benefits.
What do the various Witnesses think about that subject?
I will start with you, Ms. Hollis-Brusky.
Ms. Hollis-Brusky. Thank you, Congresswoman, and I
appreciate the opportunity to speak to that question.
I want to circle back for a minute to Mr. Shapiro's
comments about what the Federalist Society is, and I have to
say I respectfully dissent with his portrayal of the Federalist
Society and two things I want to speak to particularly.
First, I think it is telling that the lone Witness the
Republican Members of this Committee have called to persuade us
that there is no inappropriate relationship between the
Federalist Society and the Republican Party is himself a
Federalist Society member.
The second thing I want to mention, he brought up Don
McGahn's comments about in-sourcing judicial selection. Don
McGahn was the head of White House counsel, and I was sitting
next to Mr. Shapiro, in fact, at a lunch talk that Don McGahn
gave the keynote at, and he doubled down when asked about what
in-sourcing by the Federalist Society meant in the Trump
administration.
He said, ``It means two things. I was in charge of judicial
selection as the White House counsel. I only hired Federalist
Society members to work in my office.'' That was the first
thing. He said, ``They needed to demonstrate loyalty to the
team. I needed to know that we were on the same page.''
Secondly, it meant that judicial selection was run by the
vice President of the Federalist Society, Leonard Leo, who was
working for the White House, and it was exclusively through Leo
and McGahn that judges were selected also based on their
qualifications and credentials and ties to the Federalist
Society.
So, what that means is that in order to be selected as a
judge or part of the judicial selection process within the
Republican Party as it stands right now under President Trump,
one has to be involved with the Federalist Society for Law and
Public Policy Studies, and I think those are important things
to put in front of the Committee as we debate moves forward.
Ms. Lofgren. Thank you very much. I wonder if you could
comment on the ethics question that I asked, the disclosure
requirements.
Ms. Hollis-Brusky. Sure, Congresswoman.
So, as I write in my testimony, my expertise is, largely,
descriptive and I am going to talk about what I see as the
major issues when it comes to the public's perception of the
legitimacy of the Supreme Court.
I think my colleague, Professor Ginsburg, is better
positioned to talk about reforms, given his broad expertise in
comparative politics.
Ms. Lofgren. All right. Turning to Professor Ginsburg then.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. The gentleady's time has expired.
Ms. Lofgren. I yield back then, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. The gentleman from Virginia, Mr.
Cline, is recognized. Five minutes.
Mr. Cline. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Appreciate that. I will
briefly ask Professor Hollis-Brusky, have you ever contributed
to an organization called Demand Justice?
Ms. Hollis-Brusky. No.
Mr. Cline. Have you ever contributed to an organization
called the 1630 Fund?
Ms. Hollis-Brusky. No.
Mr. Cline. Because these two groups, Mr. Chair, are left-
leaning groups with former Obama and Clinton staffers at the
helm that sought to spend $5 million to, in the case of Demand
Justice, to try and block the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh.
The structure of Demand Justice allows it not only to mask
the names of its donors but the size of their contributors and
the 1630 Fund reportedly spent $141 million on more than 100
left-leaning causes during the mid-term election year, which
surpassed any amount ever raised by a left-leaning political
nonprofit. The 1630 Fund is reportedly one of the fiscal
backers of Demand Justice.
In 2019, Issue One, a think tank, found that liberal dark
money groups outspent their conservative counterparts during
the 2018 election, spending 54 percent of the total $150
million expended by all dark money groups.
The reality is that dark money is not swamping the system.
In Citizens United, such spending has never reached even 6
percent of total political spending in an election cycle.
In 2018, according to the numbers at the pro-regulation
Center for Responsive Politics it was between 2.2 percent and
5.2 percent, depending on how it is calculated.
So, I would ask Mr. Shapiro if you would like to respond to
any of the comments that were made by the last Witness.
Mr. Shapiro. Sure. Thank you, Congressman.
So, Don McGahn was the White House counsel. That is a
government position. When he talked about in-sourcing that
meant that government officials were selecting, debating,
vetting, and ultimately recommending to the President the
individuals who would be nominated or considered to be
nominated for judgeships.
Membership in the Federalist Society in that has been used
as a signaling function that has replaced Republican
allegiances or partisan allegiances.
Decades ago, before the Federalist Society existed, or even
in its early years, indications of allegiances would be
partisan allegiances.
I think it is a healthier development that we have an
intellectually rigorous organization--membership organization
committed to ideas that is being used as that signal that you
are willing to stand up and say that you dissent from the kind
of prevailing progressive orthodoxy in the legal profession.
That is what it is used as. There is no secret handshake.
There is no oath of allegiance. There is no agreement on any
particular policy issues or legal interpretations.
So, I think it is perfectly appropriate for government
officials, as they are vetting people whom they might want to
appoint, they look at all sorts of characteristics, including
any indications of devotion to a particular methodological
framework to apply or view of interpretive theories because it
is wrong to ask litmus tests.
It is inappropriate just to give these posts to cronies. I
think it is great to find intellectually rigorous judges and
populate the other positions in an administration with people
who are demonstrating a commitment to ideas, not simply the old
partisanship of the past.
I will leave it there.
Mr. Cline. Mr. Shapiro, I quoted a couple of statistics
about the percentage of contributions, of all political
spending, during the last election cycle and that in 2018 dark
money represented between 2.2 and 5.2 percent.
Do you think that statistic suggests that concerns about
the use of dark money in the political process are accurate or
are these concerns a way for the left to try and silence voices
on the right?
Mr. Shapiro. I think the concerns and so-called reform
efforts regarding dark money are definitely an attempt to chill
political speech of various kinds, whether about so-called
normal politics or about judicial confirmations.
I mean, I think Demand Justice spent $5 million opposing
Brett Kavanaugh. The 1630 Fund and the New Venture Fund that
you mentioned raised nearly a billion dollars in 2017, 2018,
for all sorts of purposes.
Look, it is kind of bizarre because you can assume that
whoever funds--well, I believe [inaudible] is going to the
exact person. I am not sure what kind of boat or other
information that gives you.
Mr. Cline. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I yield back.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you.
Next, Mr. Deutch, if you are on camera let yourself be
seen. If not, then we will go to Mr. Jeffries, the gentleman
from New York, for five minutes.
Mr. Jeffries. I thank the distinguished Chair for convening
this hearing as well as for yielding.
Mr. Shapiro, do you support the current effort by the
Senate Republican majority to jam a replacement for Justice
Ruth Bader Ginsburg down the throats of the American people so
close to an election day?
Mr. Shapiro I haven't made up my mind precisely on a
strategy and a lot will depend on how the nomination proceeds,
how the hearing process commences.
Senator McConnell has not committed to having a vote before
the election. It might happen after. We will have to see. I can
tell you that, historically, the main determinant is whether
there is a unified government, whether the same party controls
the White House and the Senate.
In those cases, in election year vacancies, all but twice
has there been a confirmation. Conversely, when the Senate and
White House are controlled by opposing parties only once has
there been a confirmation.
So, historically speaking there is plenty of precedent to
confirm in the same year. Politics always works differently,
however, so I am not going to--
Mr. Jeffries. Right. Reclaiming my time, sir. I have got
limited time.
You, apparently, took a very different position in 2016 so,
I am just trying to get an understanding of what accounts for
the difference.
I would just ask, Mr. Johnson, for unanimous consent to
enter into the record a Forbes article dated February 14th,
2016, written by Mr. Shapiro entitled, ``Don't Confirm Scalia's
Replacement Until After the Election.''
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Without objection.

MR. JEFFRIES FOR THE RECORD

=======================================================================

DON'T CONFIRM SCALIA'S REPLACEMENT UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION

By Ilya Shapiro

Justice Antonin Scalia was one of a kind, a giant who
heralded a renaissance of both originalism and and textualism.
He reoriented the study and practice of law toward the meaning
of the actual constitutional and statutory text. As we've seen
in cases like District of Columbia v. Heller--confirming the
individual right to bear arms, where both sides argued over the
meaning of the Second Amendment in historical context--we're
all originalists now.
Scalia was also, of course, a conservativee icon: The
justice most likely to be identified by lawyers and civilians
alike, and the one most likely to be read by law students.
Agree or disagree with him on any particular case--I did plenty
of both--he was a force to be reckoned with.
Which is all the more reason that in this hazy, crazy,
bizarre election year, his seat should remain vacant until the
American people can decide whether they want to swing the
balance of the Supreme Court, possibly for decades. For Scalia
is one of four conservatives on the Court, who, when joined by
Justice Anthony Kennedy, form a majority that has been crucial
for enforcing the First and Second Amendments, federalism, the
separation of powers, and other constitutional protections for
individual liberty.
If he's replaced by a progressive jurist--or even a
``moderate'' one--all that comes crashing down and there will
be no further check on the sorts of executive abuses that have
only increased under a President who thinks that when Congress
doesn't Act on his priorities, he somehow gets the authority to
enact them regardless. (And many criminal-procedure cases--
regarding the Fourth amendment protection against warrantless
searches and the Sixth amendment right to confront witnesses,
for example--feature heterodox coalitions of the more
principled justices against the more pragmatic ones, so a
centrist would be bad there too.)
In other words, this is one of the rare instances where I
agree with a strategy laid out by Senate Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell and Judiciary Committee Chair Charles Grassley,
namely not to consider any nominee until after the Presidential
election. To put a finer point on it, given how consequential
Justice Scalia's replacement will be, it would be irresponsible
for the Senate to confirm any nominee President Obama may send
them.
A new President will take office in 11 months and the
stakes are just too high in our politically schizophrenic
Nation to change the Supreme Court's direction without an
interceding popular vote. On the other side of the ledger, only
about 15-25% of the cases each year are decided on a 5 to 4
vote, so an eight-justice court can be almost fully functional.
Indeed, because it's exceedingly unlikely that a new
justice could be confirmed in time to consider and decide cases
by the end of June, this term's close cases will either be
released with a 4-4 non-decision (affirming the lower court
without setting a precedent) or carried over to the next term.
Next term starts in October, so pushing until the November
election would cause minimal disruption.
If the Democrats keep the White House, at that point there
would really be little justification for the Senate to continue
its policy and the normal process of hearings and votes could
begin--subject to filibuster or not, depending on how that
separate procedural debate goes. Given that no justice has been
nominated and confirmed during a presidential-election year
since before World War Two, there would really be very little
remarkable to having Justice Scalia's replacement play out this
way. (Justice Kennedy was confirmed in 1988, but (a) he was
nominated in the year before and (b) this was President
Reagan's third attempt to fill a vacancy that originated in
July 1987.)
Finally, while some may argue that it's somehow
``illegitimate'' or even unconstitutional for the Senate not to
provide its ``advice and consent'' as specified under article
II, section 2, there's simply no basis to conclude that this
provision constitutes an obligation to Act on presidential
nominations. Much as Senators have defended their institutional
prerogative by placing ``holds'' on executive nominees--and
just like the Senate refused to take up nominees to the
National Labor Relations Board in a case that resulted in the
Supreme Court's unanimous invalidation of President Obama's
recess appointments--they can certainly decide to slow-walk
this Supreme Court nomination.
This is purely a political debate; I'm not making a legal
argument beyond the axiomatic one that the Senate doesn't have
to do anything it doesn't want to. Justice Scalia's death has
given the Republican Party the opportunity to make the Supreme
Court into the national election issue it claims more Americans
should prioritize.
Refusing to consider President Obama's nominee--whoever he
or she is--certainly ratchets up the stakes in an already
volatile campaign, but giving the American people an
opportunity to weigh in on such an important matter is every
legislator's paramount duty.
Mr. Jeffries. So, on February 14th, which is one day after
Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died, you wrote an op-ed
for Forbes entitled, ``Don't Confirm Scalia's Replacement Until
After the Election.''
Is there anything in that article that talks about this
unified government theory of why this would be an exception at
this moment right now?
Mr. Shapiro. I don't have the article in front of me but
what I have argued throughout the saga over the battle to fill
the Scalia seat and the nomination of Merrick Garland is that
divided government is different than unified government, and
equally or more importantly, we had a situation where the
voters had re-elected President Obama in 2012 and then given
the Republicans the Senate in 2014.
So, in effect, 2016 was the deciding rubber match, if you
will. So, ultimately, voters are going to have to decide
whether the positions that politicians of both parties are
taking now--there is a lot of switching sides involved that
aren't appropriate--
Mr. Jeffries. Thanks a lot. Reclaiming my time.
You wrote in your article, just to refresh your
recollection, ``in this hazy crazy bizarre election year, his
seat should remain vacant until the American people can decide
whether they want to swing the balance of the Supreme Court
possibly for decades.''
Is that correct?
Mr. Shapiro. That sounds right.
Mr. Jeffries. You also argued in this article, ``A new
President will take office in 11 months and the stakes are just
too high in our politically schizophrenic Nation to change the
Supreme Court's direction without an interceding popular
vote.''
Is that true?
Mr. Shapiro. I am sure you are accurately quoting from my
article.
Mr. Jeffries. You also wrote in that article that ``Giving
the American people an opportunity to weigh in on such an
important matter is every legislator's paramount duty, and
given how consequential Justice Scalia's replacement will be,
it would be irresponsible for the Senate to confirm any nominee
President Obama may send them.''
Correct?
Mr. Shapiro. That sounds right.
Mr. Jeffries. Now, Justice Scalia was a consequential
justice, we can agree. Was Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg a
consequential justice in the history of American jurisprudence?
Mr. Shapiro. Undoubtedly.
Mr. Jeffries. This election is not going to take place just
11 months away from this moment that we are in right now, as
was the case when you wrote that article. It is a few weeks
away.
Is that correct?
Mr. Shapiro. Correct.
Mr. Jeffries. Did you say anything, again, about this
unified theory of government that you and others are now
inventing at this moment out of convenience? Did you say
anything about that in this article in terms of making the case
as to why Scalia should not be replaced?
Mr. Shapiro. Congressman, I just wrote a book about the
history of judicial nomination roles.
Mr. Jeffries. Well, let me ask one last question, sir. Sir,
let me ask one last question, just to clear it up because my
time is running out.
Why does the Scalia standard not apply to Ruth Bader
Ginsburg? Is it because the conservatives are bent on
destroying the health care of the American people and having
the ACA declared unconstitutional, and you are desperately
trying to secure a Supreme Court majority to accomplish that
end?
Mr. Shapiro. Congressman, I see your time is up, but I am
not going to answer when I stopped beating my wife either.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. The gentleman's time has expired.
Mr. Jeffries. Thank you. I think that answer speaks for
itself. I yield back.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. We now move to Ranking Member
Jordan for five minutes of question.
Mr. Jordan. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Professor Hollis-Brusky, in Senator Whitehouse's opening
statement he talked about his assessment was that conservatives
and Republicans, with the help of the Federalist Society, are
trying to capture the court was the words he used. Do you agree
with Senator Whitehouse's assessment?
Ms. Hollis-Brusky. Thank you for the question.
I don't make a claim in my written statement and I won't
make one here today about whether they are, in fact, captured
or whether the courts are, in fact, captured by the Federalist
Society.
What I do make an argument about is that the appearance of
capture is, certainly, reasonable, given the optics of the
Trump administration and how big of a role the Federalist
Society has played in judicial nominations since--
Mr. Jordan. There are other ways to capture the court? Are
there other appearances of capturing the court?
Ms. Hollis-Brusky?
Ms. Hollis-Brusky. I am not sure. I am not certain what you
are asking but--
Mr. Jordan. Let me give you an example. The Speaker of the
House, the minority leader of the Senate, and a number of our
Democrat colleagues have said if, in fact, they win the
election and have power and take control of the government that
they are going to pack the court with six new justices. They
are going to go from nine to 15.
That seems to me you want to use the word capture the
court, I don't think you could come up with a better way of
describing capturing the court than what the Democrats are
proposing. Is that capturing the court?
Ms. Hollis-Brusky. Historically, that has been called court
packing. It could, certainly, be viewed as capturing the court
to some extent.
Mr. Jordan. Yeah. We got this false idea that somehow the
Federalist Society has got this conspiracy going, using dark
money, when, in fact, as the gentleman from Virginia pointed
out, you got this Demand Justice spending $5 billion to stop
Justice Kavanaugh.
You have got these two organizations--1630, New Venture
Fund, spent $987 million in 2017 and 2018 alone. That is the
real dark money. The real capturing of the court is what the
Democrats want to do. I mean, they have been straight up about
it. We are going pack the court. We are going to go from nine
justices, which has been the norm of the court for 150 years,
we are going to go to 15.
Mr. Shapiro excuse me, Mr. Shapiro, Ms. Hollis-Brusky also
said people lose faith in the Rule of law when what the
Democrat Witnesses and Senator Whitehouse talked about, if, in
fact, that would happen.
If the Democrats win power and pack the court, would that
cause Americans to lose faith in an important institution our
government, the Supreme Court?
Mr. Shapiro. Well, I think two wrongs don't make a right
and court packing, historically, has been a wrong that has
inured to the detriment of our country and, for that matter, to
the party that has propounded it.
Mr. Jordan. I think the Senator also said membership in
groups dedicated to restructuring the judiciary. He used that
phrase in his opening statement.
Let me ask this question. Does the Federalist Society file
amicus briefs with the Supreme Court on important cases or on
any case, for that matter?
Mr. Shapiro?
Mr. Shapiro. It does not.
Mr. Jordan. Does it endorse or oppose judicial nominees?
Mr. Shapiro. It does not.
Mr. Jordan. Does not. The entities on the left that are
helping the Democrats, spending $987 million in two years
alone, Demand Justice spent $5 million just to go after Judge
Kavanaugh, they do those two things, don't they, Mr. Shapiro?
Mr. Shapiro. They do, and the American Constitution Society
takes positions all the time, and the ABA takes positions all
the time of a particular ideological bent.
Mr. Jordan. So, it looks like the Democrats are going after
the one organization that is actually doing it right, not
filing briefs--amicus brief with the court, not endorsing
candidates, not speaking out on certain cases. They are the
ones that are somehow capturing the court when, in fact,
Democrats have all said for years now but, certainly, in the
last week after the passing of Justice Ginsburg that they are
going to pack the court.
That is the real capture of the court we need to be
concerned about. That is what we need to be focused on
stopping.
With that, I yield back.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. I next will recognize the gentleman
from California--excuse me, from Hawaii, Ted Lieu, if he is on.
[Pause.]
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Oh. Ted Lieu from California. I am
sorry. He is not on.
With that, we will move--
Mr. Jordan. Mr. Chair, I could just ask unanimous consent
to enter into the record the piece from the Wall Street Journal
yesterday, ``Questions for Senator Whitehouse.''
As I indicated at the start of the hearing, we were not
able to question the Senator so I would ask unanimous consent
to enter this piece into the record.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Without objection.
[The information follows:]

MR. JORDAN FOR THE RECORD

=======================================================================

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Mr. Johnson of Georgia. We will now go to the gentleman
from Arizona, Mr. Stanton.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair, for holding
this hearing. Thank you to the Witnesses for being here today.
A few days ago, our Nation lost an icon, an amazing
pioneer--legal pioneer, social justice pioneer. Justice Ruth
Bader Ginsburg led the way for some of the most fundamental
rights for Americans today. Without her, our American judicial
system and way of life would be far different. So, I extend my
deepest condolences to her loved ones and those around the
country who are mourning her loss.
When our Founding Fathers established our republic, they
were keenly aware of the importance of an independent
judiciary, one that does not give in to pressure by outside
interests but instead remains committed to the Rule of law and
the people it serves.
The effectiveness of our laws and the respect given to them
by the American people rely on independent fair decisions from
our judiciary. If our judicial system is incapable of doing so,
then our democracy and Rule of law as we know it are at stake.
It is extremely troubling that a 2019 Quinnipiac poll--
University poll found that most Americans believe that the
Supreme Court is motivated by politics, not by law.
Our judicial system works when the American people believe
it is fair, independent, and transparent, and I hope we can all
agree that our judicial system needs to be independent and free
of partisan entanglements that we so often see in other
branches of government.
One area I want to talk about here today was amicus briefs,
amicus briefs filed with the U.S. Supreme Court in particular.
Amicus briefs are legal documents filed by nonlitigants with
strong interest in the subject matter. They are meant to
provide relevant information that the court may wish to
consider before rendering a decision.
However, to file an amicus brief there is a cost that can
range anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000 and above. There are
over 500 briefs filed with the Supreme Court every year. That
adds up to a large sum of money, and right now there is no
disclosure requirements of the funds used to pay for these
briefs.
Judge Gertner, I would like to ask you a question in
particular. In one high-profile case this coming Supreme Court
term, Google v. Oracle, a group called the Internet
Accountability Project filed an amicus brief supporting
Oracle's position.
Bloomberg subsequently reported that Oracle, one of the
parties to the case, had donated between $25,000 and $99,999 to
the Internet Accountability Project last year.
IAP did not disclose that fact that they had been funded
directly by Oracle, one of the parties to the litigation and
the Supreme Court's rules did not require such disclosure.
I want to get your opinion on this. As a general matter, do
you think it is appropriate for an amicus to file a brief in a
case where it directly receives funding from one of the
parties?
Ms. Gertner. I have two answers to your question.
I think it is a disclosure matter. I think there should be
a disclosure. The problem is that with respect to Supreme Court
practice, just as with Representative Lofgren's question, this
has to be something that the Supreme Court imposes on itself.
It can't be something that the Congress imposes on the
Supreme Court because of separation of powers issues. I think
you are quite right, that ought to be disclosed. It really is
not the case that the right and the left are equivalent with
respect to pressuring the court.
I just want to sort of look at the other answers to other
questions here, which was that the left, as Michael Greve, who
is a Federalist Society member, said, ``On the left there are a
million ways of getting credentials. On the right there is only
one way.''
However, one characterizes the Federalist Society, it is
wrong that it be the way to the Federal bench as opposed to
other organizations and other funnels that would channel people
to the bench.
Mr. Stanton. Your Honor, I have one more--that is a great
point. I just have one additional question. I want to make sure
I have--my time is short. I want to talk about the Judicial
Code of Ethics.
The judicial code of ethics applies to every other Federal
judge except Supreme Court justices. Especially now, what
message do you think it sends to the American people that the
Supreme Court does not have a code of ethics and what message
would it send if they adopted a code of ethics upon themselves?
Ms. Gertner. I think the Supreme Court should adopt a code
of ethics. I think we are sufficiently divided. There are these
kinds of issues that are challenges to judicial independence,
that all judges should participate in a judicial code of
ethics. The Supreme Court must, however, impose it on itself. I
think that that is the right thing to do.
Mr. Stanton. All right. I have a short time.
Any of the other Witnesses like to comment on the judicial
code of ethics for the Supreme Court?
Mr. Ginsburg. I might say one thing, if I can,
Representative, which is that the For the People Act passed
last year does call on the Judicial Conference of the United
States to draft such a code of ethics.
So, only the court can impose it on itself in our
constitutional system. We can give them some content for that
and that would increase the pressure on the court to do so.
Mr. Stanton. Maybe the Federalist Society could take this
issue up, Mr. Shapiro.
I yield back.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. The gentleman's time has expired.
You may respond, Mr. Shapiro.
Mr. Shapiro. I am not a judicial ethics expert and I don't
represent the Federalist Society. I will do what I can.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you.
We will next go to the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Chabot,
five minutes.
Mr. Chabot. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair, and thank you
to the Witnesses for testifying at this afternoon's hearing.
In light of the recent passing of Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg, this hearing is not only timely but relevant.
According to the Administrative Office of the United States
Courts, there are nearly 70 Federal court vacancies, mostly for
District court appointments that currently sit unfilled.
Thus, in his administration, the President has successfully
appointed over 200 Federal judges including Supreme Court
Justice Neil Gorsuch and, of course, Brett Kavanaugh.
That success rate is attributed to the quality of the
lawyers and jurists that the President has nominated, and that
the Senate has confirmed for the Federal bench.
It is that success rate that has drawn criticism about the
membership in organizations like the Federalist Society, which
was founded on, quote, ``principles that the State exists to
preserve freedom, that the separation of governmental powers is
central to our Constitution, and that it is emphatically the
province and duty of the judiciary to say what the law is, not
what it should be.''
Somehow those principles in which it was founded were
ignored when the Judicial Conference, the organization that
sets policy for the Federal judiciary, issued Draft Advisory
Opinion No. 117, which found that formal affiliation with the
Federalist Society, whether as a member or in leadership
position, was inconsistent with the code of conduct's canons.
That same advisory opinion did not raise similar concerns
with a similar membership organization, the American Bar
Association.
Advisory Opinion 117 was drafted despite canon four of the
judicial code of conduct, which allows judges to serve as
members and officers of nonprofit organizations, quote,
``devoted to the law, the legal system, or the administration
of justice,'' unquote, which I would submit is exactly what
sort of work the Federalist Society undertakes.
Mr. Shapiro, I would like to ask just a few questions from
you with the time I have remaining. At the outset, would you
agree with the general premise that I just laid out?
Mr. Shapiro. I think I would agree with that, yeah.
Mr. Chabot. Thank you.
Now, in your view, is the Federalist Society devoted to the
law, the legal system, and the administration of justice as
defined in canon four of the code of conduct for United States
judges and--first of all, would you say that is accurate, in
your view?
Mr. Shapiro. I haven't studied the judicial canons in
depth. It sounds to me like it is accurate.
Mr. Chabot. Okay. Thank you.
Does the Federalist Society take policy positions of any
sort?
Mr. Shapiro. It does not.
Mr. Chabot. Okay. Does the Federalist Society actively
lobby Congress?
Mr. Shapiro. It does not.
Mr. Chabot. Could anyone be a member of the Federalist
Society? Is that accurate?
Mr. Shapiro. Anyone can. I believe in law schools there is
a $5 membership fee.
Mr. Chabot. Okay. Five dollars.
Would you agree that the American Bar Association takes on
a more politically active role than the Federalist Society?
Mr. Shapiro. Yes, and it is not even close.
Mr. Chabot. Could you describe, briefly, how the two
associations, the two organizations, are different? How they
differ?
Mr. Shapiro. Sure. I think I was briefly a member of the
ABA out of law school. They gave law students free memberships
or something like that. This is not your father's or your
grandfather's ABA.
Lewis Powell was the President of the ABA and from that
that was a launching pad for him to join the Supreme Court. The
prestige of the organization has gone down, as has the
membership. I forget what the percentage of lawyers in the ABA
is now, but it is significantly lower.
The ABA does take positions both on amicus briefs and in
terms of just organizational core positions on various issues
of controversy, sometimes even nonlegal issues, I think I
recall.
The Federalist Society does none of that. The Federalist
Society is purely a membership organization that organizes both
social and professional events.
Mr. Chabot. Thank you. In the short time I have got left,
let me just say that you mentioned you had been a member of a
dues-paying member of the American Bar Association.
I was, too, for quite a few years until they came out and
took a position on Roe v. Wade against the pro-life position. I
happen to be pro-life and felt that I couldn't any longer in
good faith pay dues to that organization. So, I dropped out of
the ABA and was better for it.
So, thank you very much. I yield back my time.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. The gentleman's time has expired.
Next, the gentleman from 10nessee, Mr. Cohen, for five
minutes.
Mr. Cohen. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
It has been an interesting exercise in fiction. Ever since
Bush v. Gore when the Supreme Court decided to kill the vote in
Florida and elect a Republican candidate for president, the
court has lost and continues to lose the respect that it once
had as an independent body that determined cases by the law
instead of by politics.
Bush v. Gore was a low point that has continued in a rather
parallel course, and we see now with the Federalist Society
having control over who gets on the bench what we are seeing is
diminution and the destruction of American values.
Mr. Shapiro, do you believe in diversity among judges and
among government leaders?
Mr. Shapiro. Depends how you define diversity.
Mr. Cohen. I don't define it as White men. That is what
President Trump has appointed, predominantly, and at the Court
of Appeals he has appointed only whites. A few women, not many.
Almost all White males, no blacks, no Hispanics. A record that
is even worse than any President since Ronald Reagan.
He has appointed about 200 judges and only eight of them
have been African American. Only eight have been Hispanic.
None--no African Americans to the Court of Appeals.
That is despicable because diversity is an important part
of what America is about, giving people opportunities, giving
people--like Clarence Thomas got his opportunity. He hasn't
risen to the level of Thurgood Marshall but he has been on the
bench and served Scalia well.
People and George Bush understood appointing an African
American. Donald Trump doesn't get it. The Federalist Society
apparently doesn't get it either and they apparently got some
problem with Episcopalians and Presbyterians and Unitarians and
maybe even Jews.
It seems to be predominantly Catholics that they get when
they recommend. Catholics are great people and I almost--my
brothers went to Catholic schools and I came close to doing it.
They shouldn't have a monopoly on the bench, and to the
exclusion of Episcopal, other Protestant religions, and Jewish
people.
Merrick Garland happened to be Jewish. Ruth Bader Ginsburg
happened to be Jewish. Her wish wasn't considered. Merrick
Garland's nomination wasn't. The fantasy that has been put on
display here by you, Mr. Shapiro, that there is something okay
when the President is of the same party of the Senate to allow
a nominee to go through in the last couple of months because
the President is of the same party is basically saying that
there is no basis to believe that the judges are really ruling
based on philosophy and the law but that it is all about
politics and we want to get in our team.
Merrick Garland should have been given a vote, and nobody
talked back then about oh, well, the President was of a
different party and that is why the Rule exist.
No, it was said by McConnell and all his acolytes that it
was that the nomination was in an election year and we don't do
that, and now they are hypocrites turning around. The hair of
the hypocrite is so apparent on the Republican Senate and on
you, Mr. Shapiro.
You mentioned about these judges becoming so controversial
and being along party lines. I know you don't have much respect
for the American Bar Association. I do. They look into each of
the nominees and they rate them as qualified or not qualified.
When President Obama nominated people, no person he
nominated was considered not qualified. President Trump has
nominated nine people who were not qualified, seven of whom
were approved by the Republican Senate even though they weren't
qualified, and some of those people had allegiances and respect
of Confederate histories and didn't respect Brown v. Board of
Education and they are White people who don't respect the Brown
v. Board of Education and want to repeal Roe v. Wade. What you
have done with the Federalist Society is the end of the Supreme
Court as we knew it and you should be embarrassed.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. The gentleman yields back.
Mr. Biggs from Arizona is recognized for five minutes.
Mr. Biggs. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
I am really kind of disappointed that Senator Whitehouse
chose to leave because I had some questions I wanted to ask
him.
Because he is always talking about the dangers of dark
money in politics, and what I would ask him and say, do you
support your own past comments encouraging dark money in
liberal politics.
Why is it okay for you, Senator Whitehouse, to accept and
encourage support from dark money organizations while at the
same time attacking dark money?
I would ask him if he supported Arabella Advisors' efforts
to plan for and organize unrest should President Trump be
reelected and, moreover, what has just been reported this very
day, the unrest that they are paying for to attack Lindsey
Graham and Mitch McConnell in the Senate.
I would ask him if he supported Arabella Advisors
facilitating a fake news organization as a way to avoid FEC
rules banning micro targeting by political organizations. I
would ask him a few of those questions.
I would ask him this question. I would say, you just said,
I will quote what he said, ``a well-stocked bench can institute
policy when Congress fails to act,'' closed quote. I guess my
question would be isn't that seeking some kind of judicial
activism.
Mr. Chair, I don't know if somebody has got their phone
going off or what. I can hear somebody's phone.
So, I would ask him, because if you start talking about
capturing the court and some of you talking up there that I
heard today, and Senator Whitehouse, I find myself saying,
where have you been for the last 40 some-odd years.
When I first came out of law school, conservative
intellectuals, court observers, and writers were talking about
what you are calling court capture today but a liberal activist
bent in the Federal courts.
Judicial activism. That was what was going on. That was
okay because that is what you want. That is what you want.
The reality is this. Senator Whitehouse didn't like what
happened when the Pacific Legal Foundation took him to court
representing somebody in his district when he was the AG in
that State.
I will tell you one other thing that I have written
recently. It says you can't forget that Democrats believe the
best bet for enacting their policies is a legislatively active
Supreme Court.
They have promised to pack the court if President Trump
gets any more of his nominees on the bench, and as my colleague
from Ohio said, what better way to capture the court than to
pack it.
So, when someone says and indicates that the conservatives
are trying to capture the court by advertising, lobbying, and
supporting nominees by this president, where were you four
years ago or six years ago when the same thing was going on for
liberal judicial activists being nominated by President Obama?
When I hear let us talk about diversity, how about
diversity on the court? How about different judicial
philosophies? Well, you don't want that, do you? I would
suggest you probably don't want that.
So, that becomes a problem. How about when you start
talking about not party and you start talking about procedure
and regulation, how important that is to restore the
credibility of courts, how about getting jurists that follow
the Constitution instead of actively trying to legislate from
the bench?
Who are trying to create law, not interpret law? Not apply
the law to the case before them?
I think of the first case of seeing this kind of
outrageousness conduct towards a judicial nominee. You remember
Robert Bork. I watched that hearing. I was a practicing young
lawyer at the time. I could not believe what was happening.
Then the criticisms levied by my colleague across the aisle
from Tennessee about Clarence Thomas. I watched that. That was
an unbelievable hearing, the ruthless nature of that. It was
all topped by just a couple years ago, Brett Kavanaugh.
So, I will tell you, if you want to see people capture the
court, then you need to pull yourselves back out of it as well.
With that, Mr. Chair, I have some documents I would like to
submit for the record.
I have got the letter from James Burling dated September 5,
2018, regarding Senator Whitehouse. I have got an article from
Fox dated two days ago, questions from Senator Whitehouse from
the Wall Street Journal. Another piece dated from September 22,
2020. Another one about Sheldon Whitehouse.
Another one about Whitehouse--``Senator Whitehouse Blames
Dark Money.'' Another one called ``Schumer-Tied PAC Received
$1.7 Million from Dark Money Group.'' Another one called
``Democrats Used to Rail Against Dark Money: Now They are
Better at it Than the GOP.''
``Documents Reveal Massive Dark Money Group Boosted
Democrats in 2018.'' ``Left's Point Person for Post-Election
Violence Prep Linked to Arabella Advisors.'' ``Wealthy Donors

``Newsroom or PAC? Liberal Group Muddies Online Information
Wars.'' Facebook--
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. The gentleman's time has expired.
Mr. Biggs. I know, and these are for submission to the
record.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Okay. All right. Proceed.
Mr. Biggs. Thank you. ``Facebook Cracks Down on Fake News
Sites Including Far Left Operation Funded by Dark Money.''
``Network of News Sites Must Register as Political Committee

MR. BIGGS FOR THE RECORD

=======================================================================

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Mr. Biggs. Thank you.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. The gentleman's time has expired.
We will commence a second round of questions.
Mr. Shapiro at this time I would like to excuse Judge
Gertner, who I understand must depart at 5:00 p.m.
So, without objection, you are excused and thank you for
your appearance today.
Ms. Gertner. Thank you very much.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you.
Mr. Shapiro, Professor Hollis-Brusky mentioned--I believe
it was her in her testimony that when the U.S. Supreme Court
decided the case of Citizens United it, in a fit of judicial
activism, after discarding the robes of originalism and
textualism, decided an issue that was not brought before the
court, which was whether a corporation had a First amendment
right.
Do you agree with her characterization of the Supreme
Court's action as judicial activism?
[No response.]
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. You should unmute.
Mr. Shapiro. If I did. [Inaudible.]
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Okay. Can you hear me? Okay, we can
hear you now.
Okay. We can't hear you now.
Mr. Shapiro. I am on?
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. You are popping in and out.
Mr. Shapiro. Mr. Chair.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. I will note while you are
struggling to answer my question my time is running.
Mr. Shapiro. It looks like a green light, Mr. Chair. I
don't know what is going on here.
Can you hear me? I am sorry.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Yes, and I would like for you to
answer that question.
Mr. Shapiro. Sure. Sorry. So really quick, activism has
been thrown around by both parties when they don't like the
opinions. I don't like any activism in general.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Well, let me ask the like this. Let
me ask the question like this, Mr. Shapiro.
Was the issue of corporations having a First amendment
right of freedom of speech the issue that was first argued
before the U.S. Supreme Court in the Citizens United case?
Mr. Shapiro. It was not. It was Justice Alito asked the
deputy solicitor general whether it would be possible to ban a
book that was produced using corporate funds, and the answer
was essentially quite possibly.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. So, what?
Mr. Shapiro. That opened this larger question.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Yeah. Well, I mean, the court ended
up deciding a question that was not brought before it by the
litigants. Isn't that correct?
Mr. Shapiro. Yes. On occasion, during the course of oral
argument or other Supreme Court proceedings, other issues arise
that the court requires supplemental briefing or even, as in
this case.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. On the issues that were originally
brought by the parties to the court for a decision, that was a
fundamental breach of appellate court etiquette.
Do you agree with that, Professor Hollis-Brusky?
Ms. Hollis-Brusky. I am not sure about rules of etiquette,
but I can tell you that traditionally that has been one way to
define judicial activism is when courts and judges invite
questions that were not briefed to be brought before them so
that they can make decisions they think are appropriate.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. So, one thing that the Federalist
Society is known for is that its members who serve on the bench
are generally loathe to support any regulations of businesses,
to support Second amendment rights, to be in favor of
overturning Roe v. Wade, deregulation of business, and they
also have a habit of wanting to never take race into account in
making decisions, and they generally don't believe in measures
that would promote racial balance.
Isn't that correct, Mr. Shapiro?
Mr. Shapiro. There were a lot of statements there I would
have to take individually. Do you want to ask me one of them?
Mr. Johnson. of Georgia. Well, let us take Roe v. Wade,
number one. Federalist Society judges are prone to want to
overturn Roe v. Wade, correct?
Mr. Shapiro. I don't know what is in their heart of hearts.
I don't think a single one has had the opportunity yet to Rule
on the question of whether Roe v. Wade should be overturned.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Well, we do know that Roe v. Wade
is a litmus test for Federalist Society judicial nominees to be
in favor of overturning Roe v. Wade. Isn't that correct?
Mr. Shapiro I have not been in meetings in the White House
counsel's office. So, I don't know exactly what is asked. I
highly doubt, that type of litmus test question is asked.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Professor Hollis-Brusky, what is
your opinion on that question?
Ms. Hollis-Brusky. So, like Mr. Shapiro, I have not been
inside the White House counsel and observed anything directly.
What I would say is that with the rise of Leonard Leo as the
vice President of the Federalist Society who is very openly
anti-abortion, anti-reproductive rights, given that he is
controlling judicial nominations, one could make some
inferences from that.
So, I will go back to the appearance that with Leo in the
White House that that certainly could be a litmus test
question.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you.
Since the clock was running during my time with the
technical difficulties, I want to yield a minute to my friend
and colleague from the State of Texas, Sheila Jackson Lee.
Ms. Jackson Lee. Let me thank the Chair very much and the
Ranking Member as well for their courtesies. I am a guest on
this Subcommittee. I am a Senior Member on the Judiciary
Committee.
I was reading the definition of the Federalist Society that
indicated their textualist and originalist interpretation of
the Constitution. I hold this book and it is well known that
the Constitution has been viewed and it is most effective as a
living breathing document to ensure that all the nuances of
America are protected under the law.
I don't believe we had any need to lobby this present
administration because the White House counsel that he had at
the very early stages was very engaged with the Federalist
Society. So, rather than lobby, they simply had to pick up the
phone and call or simply had to submit a list.
Let me ask Professor Hollis-Brusky, and thank you so very
much, what happens when you have a court that is skewed
specifically on a political basis, and as someone who was in
Florida during 2000 actually counting chads, and because of the
secretary of State Republican, the governor Republican, our
counting was actually cut off.
When the two parties went to Supreme Court--and I say
parties, principals--it was a 5 to 4 political decision, and
that decision was also contrary to the vote.
Can you just give the downside of what happens when a court
is so skewed one way or the other as it relates to justice?
Ms. Hollis-Brusky. Thank you, Congressman.
I will give two answers. One, from Alexander Hamilton's
famous essay on the judiciary, Federalist 78: ``We know that
the judiciary has no power to enforce its own decisions and its
only real power is the power to persuade the public that its
decisions are well reasoned and legitimate, not grounded in
politics, not grounded in partisan politics.''
So, any decision that has the appearance or the valence of
partisan politics is problematic for judicial independence and
for judicial legitimacy. Political science corroborates this. A
wealth of political science research shows that the single
greatest threat to judicial legitimacy is the perception that a
Supreme Court is acting on politics, that it is politicized,
not an independent arbiter of the law.
So, I would give you an answer from Hamilton and an answer
from political science, but they are basically the same.
Legitimacy suffers.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Reclaiming my time.
Ms. Jackson Lee. Yield back. Thank you.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Which has expired.
I will now turn to the gentlelady from Alabama for her five
minutes.
Ms. Roby. I thank Chair, and I yield to the gentleman from
Ohio.
Mr. Jordan. I thank the gentlelady for yielding.
Professor Hollis-Brusky, is it appropriate for Democrats to
impeach the President for following the law?
Ms. Hollis-Brusky. I am not a lawyer or constitutional
lawyer myself. Impeachment is a political process, and it has
always been a political choice.
Mr. Jordan. So, you think it is? You think what the Speaker
suggested on Sunday on one of the Sunday talk shows that the
President following what the Constitution requires, naming and
putting up a nominee for a court vacancy, do you think it is
appropriate for the Speaker and the Democrats to move ahead
with impeachment for that reason?
Ms. Hollis-Brusky. That is not what I said.
Mr. Jordan. No, but that is what I am asking.
Ms. Hollis-Brusky. What I said is that impeachment is a
political process.
I am not taking a position on what is and what is not an
impeachable offense. I don't feel qualified to answer that.
Mr. Jordan. Well, there can't be an impeachable offense
because he is doing what the Constitution says. So, I am just
asking if doing what the Constitution says, nominating an
individual for the Supreme Court now that there is a vacancy
and the Speaker said she was open to impeaching the President
to stop that nominee from being confirmed in the Senate, I am
just asking you if that is appropriate.
Ms. Hollis-Brusky. What I will say about that comes from my
understanding of comparative democratic norms and how
democracies die, which is we are in a process where parties are
escalating against one another, and according to the political
science, that is how democracies die, when you abandon mutual
toleration for the other party and respect, and if you don't
engage in forbearance, which is restraint of one's power to
respect the spirit of the constitutional system.
So, what I am hearing from you sounds a lot to me like
another level of escalation that we have been engaged with
between these two parties over something.
Mr. Jordan. Is packing the court escalation?
Ms. Hollis-Brusky. I think Levitsky and Ziblatt in ``How
Democracies Die'' would call this constitutional hardball, and
I think yes, they would characterize it as another escalation.
Mr. Jordan. Yes. It has been norm for 150 years and they
are going to put six new justices, take it from nine to 15.
They have been very clear about that. That is the biggest
escalation you could talk about.
You earlier said that the Federalist Society's actions and
conservatives' actions, quote, ``have led people to lose faith
in the Rule of law.''
Would Americans lose faith in the Rule of law if the
Democrats proceeded with impeachment based solely on the fact
they are trying to slow up the President's constitutional duty
to name someone to the court, and would Americans lose faith in
the Rule of law if the Democrats packed the court?
Ms. Hollis-Brusky. Was that a question for me, Congressman?
Mr. Jordan. Yep.
Ms. Hollis-Brusky. Okay. Again, I would take a step back
here and say it doesn't matter where this behavior started if
we end in mutually assured destruction. So, what I am seeing
happening is escalation and I believe that the President
putting a nominee through this close to the election will be
understood also as escalation, given what happened with the
Garland nomination.
So yes, I think that court packing would be the next step
in escalation and were the Republicans to take back power they
may expand the court again or engage in jurisdiction stripping.
This is exactly the kind of behavior that they talk about.
Mr. Jordan. So, are you opposed to the Democrats' court
packing plan?
Ms. Hollis-Brusky. I haven't read the--I am listening to
reports of it today and I am not--
Mr. Jordan. Well, it is a simple question, Professor. The
Democrats want to add six people to the court. Are you for that
or against it?
Ms. Hollis-Brusky. It would have to depend on what happens
over the course of the next month and what the Republicans do.
Mr. Jordan So, if the Republicans follow the Constitution,
the President names a nominee and the Senate does what it is
supposed to do, have hearings and confirm or deny that nominee,
we will have to see what happens. If they follow the
Constitution, somehow that is escalating.
That is following the law. That is following the
Constitution. When the Democrats add six to the court that is
okay? Is that what you are saying?
Ms. Hollis-Brusky. All I will say is that according to
Levitsky and Ziblatt, the only way to get out of this vicious
cycle of escalation is for the party in power, and that right
now is the Republicans, to engage in forbearance, which is
intentional restraint of one's power to respect the spirit of
the broader constitutional system to take the totality of the--
Mr. Jordan. Yeah. I think the spirit that should be
respected is what the American people elected the President to
do and elected a Republican Senate to do, and that is put
conservatives on the court, and all we are doing is following
the Constitution to do that.
Mr. Ginsburg, do you agree with the Democrats' plan to pack
the court?
Mr. Ginsburg. I would distinguish between the expanding the
number of members of the court and packing it, and as the
number is.
Mr. Jordan. Well, you think they are going to put
conservatives on the court?
Mr. Ginsburg. I could imagine a bipartisan agreement that
would restore the balance.
Mr. Jordan. You are crazy. There is no way that is going to
happen.
[Laughter.]
Mr. Jordan. They are going to add six new people to the
court, and they are going to make three liberals and three
conservatives? In your dreams.
Mr. Ginsburg. I would like to see a restoration of the
filibuster rule, which would require that kind of bipartisan
cooperation. That is how we get out of this.
Mr. Jordan. Well, they have said they are getting rid of
that too, Mr. Ginsburg. Senator Schumer said he is getting rid
of the filibuster.
Mr. Ginsburg. This has been an escalation as you well know.
Mr. Jordan. You guys are living in a dream world because
that is not where they are at. They have said they are going to
impeach the President for following the law. They are going to
pack the court.
They are going to get rid of the filibuster and a whole
host of other crazy things that go right at the structure, and
somehow you guys come here and blame Republicans for the
concern.
I think the American people see through it. They see what
the Democrats are trying to do, change fundamental
institutions, fundamental structures in our government, and you
are saying oh, it is going to be warm and fuzzy and bipartisan.
There is no way.
With what they are threatening, what they are pressuring,
what they are saying, no way that is going to happen.
Mr. Ginsburg. I would say it should be bipartisan, Mr.
Jordan.
Mr. Jordan. Would adding six new justices cause people to
lose faith? Same question I asked Professor Hollis-Brusky. Mr.
Ginsburg, would that cause Americans to lose faith in our Rule
of law?
Mr. Ginsburg. I think the question, again, is who are they
and how is it done, and I don't think that just adding justices
on its own is fundamentally going to cause people to lose
faith. If it is part of this process of partisan escalation
then yes, and that is why I would like to see the actual
restoration of this.
Mr. Jordan. Well, so I would disagree with that. Adding six
new people to the court that is like saying oh, we don't like
what is happening, so we are going to change the rules. We are
going to say that now we get the court is 15. I don't see how
that strengthens our institutions or helps in any way.
Mr. Ginsburg. Well.
Mr. Jordan. Is packing the court capturing the court? Seems
a term that Mr. Whitehouse used.
Mr. Ginsburg. Packing--
Mr. Jordan. Some of you have used this in your statements.
Capturing the court, it seems to me, the most obvious capturing
of the court is when you say we are going to change the rules
and we are going to add six of our folks to it. We will capture
it that way. Is packing the court capturing the court, Mr.
Ginsburg?
Mr. Ginsburg. One way to capture a court is to control its
personnel and establish a dominant faction on the court.
Mr. Jordan. It is the easiest way. Maybe the easiest way.
Mr. Ginsburg. Yeah. Yeah.
Mr. Jordan. Change the rules. We will changes the rules so
we get control of the court. We are not going to follow the
rules. We are not going to let the American people decide
through elections who gets elected, who gets to nominate. We
lost the election, but now we won one, so we are going to add
six new people to the court.
That is not fair, and the American people understand it. It
was tried once. Thank goodness it didn't happen, and I hope it
doesn't happen. I hope it never happens.
I yield back.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. The gentleman yields back.
Next up is the gentlelady from California, Ms. Lofgren, for
five minutes.
Ms. Lofgren. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
It is interesting listening to the latest exchange because
there are some assumptions that are unwarranted.
It is as if Mr. McConnell succeeds in jamming through a
confirmation within either after presidential election or
before that somehow that is going to result in an expansion of
the court. No one has said that. Certainly, Mr. Biden has not
said that.
I think the real issue is following the rules and being
fair is important for the preservation of our democracy, and we
have seen, in my view, this administration has repeatedly
violated norms and, in some cases, statutes because he can in
pursuit of power.
There are some things that are more important than power
and keeping power, and that is the preservation of our
democratic republic. There have been plenty of times when I
have been on the losing side of an election. The person I was
backing didn't win.
You don't do everything. You don't violate rules and norms.
You don't jeopardize confidence in the democracy just to keep
power. That way leads to the end of this beautiful experiment
in our democracy.
So, I would just like to say I think it is important. The
gentleman from Ohio and the Ranking Member was talking about
following the rules. The Rule was set and there is a little
creative spinning of it now, but Members of the Senate, when
the last Obama nomination, that we would not do a confirmation
in an election year and, in fact, it used to be called the
Biden rule. They quoted the Biden rule, that has been kind of
the standard that people accepted.
Now, because apparently the President must assume he is
going to lose the election, there is a rush to not live within
that norm that had been established to try and grab power at
the expense of the confidence that the country has in the
court.
We know from polling that a majority of the American people
now believe the court is political, and that is both
Republicans and Democrats believe that the court has become a
political animal.
That is very dangerous for our country, and I think it is
important that we think of ways that we, each of us, can pull
back from our corners and see how we can take steps to build
confidence in the institutions of our government, in the
institutions of our society to preserve this democracy.
Now, I am going to get to a quick question, if I can. The
other gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Chabot, talked about the code of
conduct that was then withdrawn, and I thought it was
interesting that the Rule didn't say that you couldn't accept
trips. It just said you couldn't be a member of the
association.
I am wondering, Professor Ginsburg, whether you think that
it undercuts confidence among people to see members of the
Supreme Court accepting lodging, travel, meals, paid by the
Federalist Society or others, any ideological group that might
have an interest in the outcome of decisions, and couldn't the
Congress set some standards and requirements for the Supreme
Court to actually disclose information and benefits that they--
Mr. Ginsburg. I am a big believer in the idea that sunshine
is the best disinfectant. So, I think disclosure is important
and I think it can be done and, certainly, the code of ethics
that has been proposed to be passed by the Judicial Conference
for the Supreme Court could be adopted by the Supreme Court.
They could adopt a code tomorrow, and I don't see why they
don't.
I think that, really, just making the public more aware of
this issue would put some pressure on them to do so. It is not
like I think that they are engaged in nefarious activity. The
public has a right to know if we have a lot of power at the
court.
Ms. Lofgren. I am not saying it is nefarious. The
perception is important, and what we are talking about now is
the confidence of the American people in the institutions of
their government: Legislative, judicial, and executive.
I see my time has expired, Mr. Chair, and I yield back.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you.
We will now have five minutes from the gentleman from
Virginia, Mr. Cline.
Mr. Cline. I thank the Chair, and I want to thank the
gentlelady for her remarks. I know she has been an advocate for
preservations of the rules and the norms of not only this
Committee but of our system of our republic.
Working for my predecessor, Congressman Goodlatte, when he
was alongside the gentlelady from California, I think there was
a bipartisanship there. Often, they would put aside partisan
differences to work to preserve those norms.
The preservation of the democratic republic rests in part
on the restoration of confidence in this institution. When this
institution devolves into partisan power plays, I think whether
it is appointments to the court or impeachments of the
President, if they are not done for reasons that are legitimate
then it does reduce the confidence of the people in this
institution and in their entire system.
So, to restore that confidence, I agree, we must respect
the norms of American society and American governance, and
those include maintaining a nine-person court. Those include
respecting the Article 3 advise and consent role of the Senate
decision to appoint and confirm Article 3 judges under Article
1, and restoration and respect for the filibuster Rule is a
norm that over time has become part of the system and that has
been abandoned for partisan political reasons.
The gentlelady mentions actions in pursuit of power, and I
would argue that the expansion of the court to name justices of
one party or another or lean one direction or another would be
an action in pursuit of power, and if you question that all you
really have to do is flip it on its head and say if the current
President sought to do the same thing and sought legislation
currently to expand by six justices the Supreme Court and name
six additional justices right now, that would be viewed by my
colleagues on the other side as action in pursuit of power.
Therefore, you must view what the minority in the Senate is
currently proposing as equally based in the pursuit of power.
So, I long for a return to these norms, a respect for these
norms. That is the respect that I have for this Committee. It
is why I got on this Committee, and so I hope to contribute to
that as a Member of the Committee.
I will say, the gentlelady also spoke about accountability
on the court and about transparency on the court. Transparency
is something I am very interested in when it comes to the
Federal Government, and I have co-sponsored a bill with the
gentleman from Rhode Island, Mr. Cicilline, called the Judicial
Travel Accountability Act that requires a judicial officer to
annually disclose the source, description, and value of certain
gifts, a detailed description of meetings and events attended
including the names of other known attendees and total expenses
for transportation, lodging, and meals.
That bill, I believe, is in this Committee. I would love to
see it moved forward in a bipartisan way, and so to further
encourage that norm of transparency which has developed over
time and restore confidence in the institution of government
and the institution of the courts, and in this institution.
So, with that, Mr. Chair, I don't have any other questions
and I will yield back.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. The gentleman yields back.
With that, we will conclude this hearing. I want to thank
the Witnesses for their testimony. Let us see. You will bear
with me one second.
[Pause.]
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. If there is any need to supplement
the record in any way, it will remain open. All As will have
five legislative days to submit additional written questions
for the Witnesses or additional materials for the record.
With that, the hearing is adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 5:29 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]
