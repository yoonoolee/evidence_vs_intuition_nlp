hearing is to learn from stakeholders about current challenges
affecting highway-railroad grade crossing safety, trespassing
and suicide incidents, blocked grade crossings, as well as
efforts to mitigate safety and societal concerns of these
issues. The Subcommittee will hear testimony from the Federal
Railroad Administration (FRA); Illinois Commerce Commission;
Alameda Corridor-East Construction Authority; Operation
Lifesaver, Inc.; Chicago City Council; and Norfolk Southern
Corporation.

BACKGROUND

I. HIGHWAY-RAIL GRADE CROSSINGS

GRADE CROSSING SAFETY

A highway-rail grade crossing (``grade crossing'') is a
location where a highway, road, or street intersects with a
railroad right-of-way at the same level (at-grade). An
estimated 210,000 grade crossings are located throughout the
U.S. rail system as of 2018.\1\ Public grade crossings are
roadways that are under the jurisdiction of, and maintained by,
a public authority. Private grade crossings are on privately
owned roadways and are intended for use by the road's owner or
by the owner's licensees and invitees. A private crossing is
not intended for public use and is not maintained by a public
highway authority. Grade crossings can be equipped with various
warning devices such as: flashing lights, gates, or signage to
alert motorists and pedestrians to an upcoming crossing; others
may not be not equipped with any warning device.

Its Accident Prediction Model and Improve Guidance for Using the Data

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
According to FRA data, from 2009-2019,\2\ 22,547 collisions
occurred at grade crossings, resulting in 9,658 injuries and
2,731 fatalities.\3\ Of these, individuals operating
automobiles, truck-trailers, and pick-up trucks comprised the
three leading categories of users involved in the incidents--a
total of 16,732 collisions.\4\ Moreover, more than 36 percent
of the total incidents were caused by individuals failing to
stop at a crossing, almost 26 percent due to individuals who
stopped on a crossing, and nearly 14 percent due to those who
went around a warning gate.\5\

Grade-crossing incidents involving pedestrians occur less
frequently than those involving automobiles but have a higher
fatality rate.\6\ From 2009-2019, 1,674 collisions involving
pedestrians occurred, of which 779 were fatal.\7\ For
comparison, while collisions involving pedestrians were the
fourth most common types of incidents (7.42 percent of total
grade crossing collisions) from 2009-2019, they represented
38.07 percent of the total number of fatal collisions.\8\
Additionally, 406 grade crossing collisions (or 1.86 percent of
all collisions) were found to be the result of those attempting
or committing suicide over the same time period.\9\

GRADE CROSSING DATA

Railroads must file monthly reports with FRA for grade
crossing incidents. Such reports must be filed within 30 days
following the end of month in which the incident occurred, and
they must update or correct those reports upon becoming aware
of an error or new information.\10\ These reports are
maintained in FRA's Railroad Accident/Incident Reporting
System, and the agency receives and processes late and amended
reports for up to five years following the year the incident
report occurred.\11\ Additionally, railroads must immediately
report to the National Response Center when the operation of a
railroad results in a fatality that occurs within 24 hours of a
train incident at a grade crossing, among other reporting
requirements.\12\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Rail Safety Improvement Act (RSIA) of 2008 directed
railroad carriers to report information, as specified by the
Secretary of Transportation, about previously unreported grade
crossings and to periodically update the information.\13\ In
2015, the FRA issued a final rule requiring railroads to submit
information to the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT)
National Highway-Rail Crossing Inventory, a publicly available,
uniform national inventory database containing detailed
information on each grade crossing in the country.\14\ The
Inventory can be used to gather data for planning and
implementing crossing improvement programs.\15\

FRA also provides data tools and resources to support
efforts to improve grade crossing safety. GX Dash! provides
national and localized information about grade crossing
collisions from 2009 to present.\16\ FRA grade crossing
inspectors and state and local officials can also rank grade
crossings by using reports generated by FRA's Web Accident
Prediction System (WBAPS) that list public crossings ranked by
predicted incidents per year.\17\ GradeDec.net allows state and
local officials to change crossing parameters to assess grade
crossing improvement projects' impacts on safety. Both WBAPS
and GradeDec.net rely on an FRA accident prediction model,
which include formulas for accident and severity prediction and
a model for resource allocation. A September 2019 DOT Inspector
General (IG) report found that FRA has not adjusted its
accident prediction formula since 2013 despite updated incident
data and grade crossing inventory reporting, potentially
limiting the formula's ability to reflect current conditions
and new safety issues.\18\ FRA agreed with the IG
recommendation that FRA implement a procedure for determining
when to evaluate and, if necessary, adjust the normalizing
constants for the accident prediction formula.\19\ FRA says it
is working to meet the IG recommendation.\20\

STATES' GRADE CROSSING ACTION PLANS

As part of RSIA 2008, Congress directed the DOT Secretary
to identify the 10 states with the most grade crossing
collisions on average over the previous three years. The law
required those states to develop and submit to the DOT
Secretary for approval a state highway-rail grade crossing
action plan that focuses on crossings that had experienced
multiple accidents or were at high risk for accidents and
identifies specific solutions for improving safety at
crossings.\21\ Based on FRA's analysis, Alabama, California,
Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Ohio, and
Texas developed action plans to comply with the mandate.\22\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In 2015, as part of the Fixing America's Surface
Transportation (FAST) Act, Congress directed the FRA to develop
a model of a state-specific grade crossing action plan.\23\ FRA
issued this model plan in conjunction with the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) in November 2016.\24\ The FAST Act also
directed the agency to issue regulations, within 18 months of
distributing that model action plan, to require each state to
develop and implement a state action plan. The 10 states
required by RSIA 2008 to develop an action plan were to update
their action plans, submit them for review, and submit an
implementation report.\25\ Per statute, these action plans were
required to identify grade crossings that have experienced
recent accidents or incidents or multiple accidents or
incidents, or at high-risk for accidents or incidents; identify
specific strategies for improving crossings safety; and
designate a state official responsible for managing the state
action plan. In November 2019, the FRA issued a notice of
proposed rulemaking intended to fulfill the FAST Act
mandate.\26\

II. BLOCKED GRADE CROSSINGS

Grade crossings can become blocked when trains prevent the
flow of vehicular or pedestrian traffic from crossing railroad
tracks. Blocked crossings can congest traffic and cause travel
delays, which not only frustrates communities but also may
create safety risks when drivers and pedestrians attempt to
cross the tracks to beat an oncoming train or try to go around
or through a stopped train. Additionally, safety can be
impacted when first responders responding to an emergency
encounter one or more blocked crossing and cannot quickly find
an alternative route.
According to the FRA, 35 states and Washington, D.C. have
laws in place attempting to address blocked crossings by on-
track railroad equipment.\27\ More specifically, seven states
have no time limit; 14 states and Washington, D.C. allow no
longer than five minutes; 10 states allow no more than 10
minutes; three states allow no more than 15 minutes; and one
state allows for no more than 20 minutes for a train to block a
crossing.\28\ However, in recent years railroads have been
successful in challenging many of these state laws in the
courts on the grounds that those laws are pre-empted by federal
law. A recent legal challenge to a state law on blocked
highway-rail grade crossings occurred in 2018 in Indiana.
Indiana had a statute that barred railroads from blocking
crossings for more than 10 minutes, except in situations
outside of the railroads' control.\29\ Violations were
considered civil violations and carried a minimum $200 fine.
After 23 violations, Norfolk Southern challenged the state's
regulation in court. In September 2018, the Indiana Supreme
Court ruled that local governments do not have the authority to
fine railroads that block crossings, because while no federal
law explicitly regulates railroads from blocking grade
crossings, the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act
(ICCTA) included an express preemption provision to limit state
government regulation over interstate commerce.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\27\ According to the FRA, these include: Alabama; Arizona;
Arkansas; Connecticut; Delaware; District of Columbia; Florida;
Georgia; Idaho; Illinois; Indiana; Iowa; Kansas; Kentucky; Louisiana;
Maine; Massachusetts; Minnesota; Mississippi; Missouri; Montana;
Nebraska; New Hampshire; New Jersey; New York; North Dakota; Ohio;

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
While there are no federal regulations that directly
address the amount of time a train may block public grade
crossings, 49 C.F.R. Section 234.209 prohibits standing trains,
locomotives, and other railroad equipment from unnecessarily
activating grade crossing warning devices. According to FRA,
this is not limited to standing trains, locomotives, and other
railroad equipment that block vehicular access to the crossing.
In May 2019, FRA Administrator Ronald Batory sent letters to
each of the seven Class I railroads, writing that FRA had
``noticed a sharp increase in the frequency and volume of
complaints it has been receiving about blocked highway-rail
grade crossings across the United States.'' The letter also
noted that federal regulations do not set a specific limit on
the time a crossing may be blocked but instead believes that
railroads, states, and local jurisdictions are best positioned
to address specific concerns about blocked crossings ``because
each community has unique road networks and emergency response
characteristics and needs.'' \30\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\30\ Federal Railroad Administrator Ronald Batory, Letter to Class
I railroads, May 16, 2019.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In a report issued in May 2019 by the Government
Accountability Office (GAO), which focused on the safety and
other impacts of longer freight trains, GAO recommended the FRA
Administrator ``work with railroads to engage state and local
governments to (a) identify community-specific impacts of train
operations, including longer trains, where streets and highways
cross railroad rights-of-way and (b) develop potential
solutions to reduce those impacts.'' \31\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In December 2019, the FRA launched a Blocked Crossing
Incident Reporter website where the public and law enforcement
can report the date, time, location, and duration that a
crossing was blocked.\32\ The agency intends to use the data
collected to achieve a better understanding of the location,
duration, and impacts of blocked crossings. Moreover, as part
of RSIA 2008, Congress directed the DOT Secretary to require
each railroad carrier to maintain a toll-free telephone service
for the rights-of-way over which it dispatches trains to
receive calls from the public reporting malfunctions of safety
devices at crossings, disabled vehicles blocking railroad
tracks at crossings, obstructions of the view of a train's
approach, or the safety information about crossings.\33\ These
telephone numbers and the number registered to each grade
crossing are required to be posted on signs at crossings.

III. TRESPASSERS

Rail trespassers most often are pedestrians who walk across
or along railroad tracks as a shortcut,\34\ with 74 percent of
trespassing casualties occurring within 1,000 feet of a grade
crossing, based on data from November 2013 to October 2017.\35\
According to FRA data seen in the figure below, approximately
400 to 500 trespass fatalities and a similar number of injuries
occurred each year nationally from 2012 to 2019.\36\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The FRA has been trying to tackle this problem on several
fronts. One of the FRA's sponsored programs, the Highway-Rail
Grade Crossing Safety and Trespass Prevention Research Program,
is housed at the Volpe Center. The program developed a National
Strategy to prevent trespassing, which focuses on four
strategic areas: data analysis, community site visits, funding,
and stakeholder partnerships.\40\ The National Transportation
Safety Board (NTSB) has also discussed various ways to educate
the public about rail trespasser safety. At a 2015 forum on
trespassing, the NTSB highlighted a three-pronged (``the 3
E's'') approach that includes engineering (such as warning
signs, surveillance, and fencing), education (for the general
public, law enforcement, and private railroads), and
enforcement (policing and fines).\41\ It was noted that FRA
collects data only on trespassing activity resulting in a
fatality or injury, while private railroads could have much
larger data sets of trespassing instances that may produce more
actionable solutions.\42\ Using data from a Class I railroad,
FRA found that the railroad's reported number of close calls
was much larger than the number of casualties over the same
timeframe (the data excluded suicides), indicating that the
potential for additional trespassing casualties is
significant.\43\

IV. SUICIDES

Grade crossings and railroad rights-of-way have been used
for suicide attempts. Prior to June 2011, the FRA did not
collect any information about suicide incidents, so information
is recent. Medical examiners (ME) and coroners are responsible
for determining whether the cause of a death is suicide. When a
ME or a coroner reports that the cause of a rail fatality is
undetermined, it is recorded as a trespassing death rather than
a suicide. No explicit criteria exists to aid in determining
whether a death is a suicide, so metrics can vary by
county.\44\ Additionally, the FRA warns that any statistics
likely underrepresent rail suicides and determinations may take
months or even years.\45\ For this reason, while data for 2018
and 2019 is listed in the figure below, the FRA warns that
suicide figures are vastly underrepresented and totals may
continue to fluctuate.\46\

In an effort to better understand and reduce rail suicide
rates, the FRA partners with the Volpe Center (Volpe) to
identify, implement, and evaluate appropriate mitigation
strategies. To achieve these goals, Volpe and FRA focus on six
rail suicide prevention areas: suicide countermeasure pilot
projects, such as surveillance, advertising of help services,
and automated texts or calls sent when entering dangerous
areas; media reporting of trespassing and suicide incidents,
including recommendations for responsible reporting; the Global
Railway Alliance for Suicide Prevention, an international
working group; trespasser intent determination, meaning
assistance to MEs and coroners in how best to determine
probable cause of death; GIS mapping of suicide locations, to
proactively determine potential at-risk areas; and lastly,
demographic and environmental characteristics, to provide an
overview of common patterns.\47\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\47\ ``Rail Suicide Prevention webpage.'' Accessible at: https://
www.volpe.dot.gov/rail-suicide-prevention.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
When determining characteristics of rail suicides in the
U.S., Volpe found a series of trends. First, consistent with
national suicide patterns, rail suicide fatalities more often
involve men than women.\48\ Second, while Centers for Disease
Control data shows that overall suicide victims are typically
over the age of 45, rail suicide victims tend to be younger,
under the age of 45.\49\ Incidents of rail suicide peak in the
springtime, similar to national trends, and involve freight
trains more often than passenger trains.\50\ Using data from
2012 to 2018, California consistently has the highest number of
total suicide incidents, followed by Illinois and New York.\51\
In separate research sponsored by the FRA and published in
2014, the agency concluded that 96% of suicide incidents
occurred on areas of track that did not have a barrier to
restrict access to the right-of-way: 55% of incidents occurred
in suburban areas, 25% in downtown or urban areas, and 20% in
rural areas.\52\

V. OPERATION LIFESAVER

Established in 1972, Operation Lifesaver, Inc. (OLI) is a
non-profit organization dedicated to improving rail safety by
providing public education and awareness programs to help
prevent and reduce collisions, injuries, and fatalities,
including trespassing and suicide events, occurring on and
around railroad tracks and grade crossings.\53\ OLI operates in
states and localities across the country through its network of
authorized volunteer speakers and trained instructors who
provide rail safety education to diverse groups, such as
schools, driver education students, professional drivers,
emergency responders, and law enforcement. The organization is
supported by federal, state, and local government agencies,
highway safety organizations, and the railroads. Congress
appropriates approximately $1 million per year to OLI, while
the non-profit also receives funding from donations, private
organizations, and the Federal Highway Administration.\54\

VI. SECTION 130 GRADE CROSSING PROGRAM

In 1987, Congress created the Section 130 program, which
the FHWA administers to provide funding for safety improvements
that reduce the number of fatalities, injuries, and crashes at
grade crossings.\55\ Funded through annual set-asides from the
Highway Safety Improvement Program, Section 130 is apportioned
to states according to a formula that is based half on the
number of public grade crossings located in the state compared
to the national total and half on the statutory formula under
49 U.S.C. 104(b)(3)(A) as in effect on the day before the date
of enactment of MAP-21. Each state is guaranteed to receive at
minimum 0.5 percent of apportioned funds. The federal share of
projects funded through this set-aside is 90 percent.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\55\ 23 U.S.C. Sec. 130 was enacted by Public Law 100-17, the
Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
At least half of the set-aside funds for each fiscal year
must be available for the installation of protective devices;
the remaining half can be used for any hazard elimination
project, including the installation of protective devices. The
FAST Act also made eligible projects that eliminate hazards
caused by blocked crossings due to idling trains. In addition,
states may use section 130 funding to make incentive payments
to local governments for the closure of grade crossings so long
as the railroad that owns the tracks makes an incentive payment
as well. For projects that eliminate grade crossings at which
active warning devices are in place or ordered to be installed
by a state regulatory agency, railroads must contribute 5
percent of the project cost.\56\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\56\ 23 CFR Sec. 646.210.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
States must survey all highways to identify grade crossings
that may require separation, relocation, or protective devices,
and implement a schedule of projects for this purpose.\57\
States adhere to this requirement by prioritizing crossings
that cause the greatest hazard to the traveling public. Each
year, states report to FHWA on the progress they have made on
implementing Section 130 and the effectiveness of the projects'
improvements; every two years, FHWA reports to Congress on the
program.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\57\ 23 U.S.C. Sec. 130(d).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The obligation period for these funds include the fiscal
year that they are apportioned plus three fiscal years. At the
end of that period, the funds lapse and cannot be obligated.
States may 'pool' their apportionments over multiple fiscal
years in order to fund expensive projects that cost more than a
state is provided in any one fiscal year. The FAST Act
reauthorized the Section 130 program at $225 million for fiscal
year 2016; $230 million for fiscal year 2017; $235 million for
fiscal year 2018; $240 million for fiscal year 2019; and $245
million for fiscal year 2020.\58\ At the end of fiscal year
2019, the balance of all available unobligated funds totaled
$649 million, of which $321 million was available for the
installation of protective devices and $328 million for the
elimination of hazards.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\58\ Public Law 114-94 Sec. 1108.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition to Section 130 program funding, grade crossing
improvement projects are eligible for several federal
discretionary funding opportunities, such as the Nationally
Significant Freight and Highway Projects program (created by
the FAST Act and referred to as INFRA by this Administration
and FASTLANE by the previous Administration), as well as the
Better Utilizing Investments to Leverage Development (referred
to as BUILD by this Administration and TIGER by the previous
Administration).\59\ The Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and
Safety Improvements (CRISI) grant program, created by the FAST
Act and administered by the FRA, provides discretionary grants
for projects that improve the safety, efficiency, or
reliability of rail transportation systems, including grade
crossing improvement projects.\60\

TRACKING TOWARD ZERO: IMPROVING GRADE CROSSING SAFETY AND ADDRESSING
COMMUNITY CONCERNS

----------

WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 2020

House of Representatives,
Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous
Materials,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
Washington, DC.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m., in
room 2167, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Daniel Lipinski
(Chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Mr. Lipinski. The subcommittee will come to order.
I ask unanimous consent that the chair be authorized to
declare recess during today's hearing. Without objection, so
ordered.
I will now recognize myself for an opening statement.
Good morning. Today's hearing is part of this
subcommittee's continued work on the surface transportation
reauthorization. With the recent rollout of House Democrats'
infrastructure principles, which include a robust $55 billion
investment for rail infrastructure, today's discussion around
how to address grade crossing safety and associated community
concerns is a timely one.
Addressing the issues we will hear about today is one of my
top priorities for the rail portion of the FAST Act
reauthorization, particularly providing more funding for grade
separations, quiet zones, and other infrastructure that
improves safety and the quality of life.
I grew up 100 yards from railroad tracks, so I know
firsthand the impact of living near a railroad. Chicagoland is
the rail hub of North America. And my congressional district
has the most grade crossings of any in the country, so my
constituents experience the issues we will hear about today on
a regular basis.
Some of those issues include blocked crossings, train horn
noise, idling trains, deaths and injuries at grade crossings
and along rail rights-of-way, and railroad property upkeep.
I am pleased that we have Alderman Matt O'Shea from
Chicago's 19th Ward here today to talk about the problems faced
by his constituents.
The launch in December of FRA's blocked grade crossing
reporting system is a step in the right direction. But let me
be clear: the notion that the way a community experiencing
blocked grade crossings should try to solve the problem is to
fill out a report and submit it to FRA or call the railroad and
hope the railroad will unblock the crossing is not a solution.
More and stronger tools are needed, and I look forward to
hearing from Alderman O'Shea, Mr. Vercruysse, and others on
options they recommend Congress look at.
Another issue I want to touch upon is grade crossing
separations. I was pleased last year to work with my colleagues
in the State of Illinois to secure funding for a critical grade
separation at 63rd and/or 65th and Harlem in Chicago. The
CREATE rail modernization program, which has made significant
progress in making the Chicagoland rail network more efficient,
was actually launched from that site, and that grade separation
is labeled GS1 in the CREATE program project list. While I am
pleased we now have the money to get the grade separation
constructed, there are numerous other crossings I would like to
see separated. The current amount authorized for the section
130 grade crossing program is nowhere near enough to fund one
grade separation in my district, let alone the many that need
to be done across the country.
I look forward to hearing from Mr. Christoffels of the
Alameda Corridor-East Project, and other witnesses, on how a
dedicated Federal program for grade separations can help speed
up these vital grade separations.
We also need to find more funding for quiet zones and
streamline the process for communities to become a quiet zone.
I understand the role that the sounding of the train horn
plays in notifying people a train is approaching in maintaining
safety near a crossing. However, there has to be a way we can
institute more quiet zones in a timely manner and make
improvements that provide an equivalent level of safety to
train horns. The current process to obtain a quiet zone is just
too arduous.
I look forward to hearing from Karl Alexy from FRA, and
other panelists, on ways we can do this.
Finally, over the years I have repeatedly heard from
numerous communities I represent about poorly maintained
railroad property, especially unpainted bridges. Railroads are
just like any property owners in the community and need to
maintain their property in a way that is reflective of the care
and values other residents put in the community. It is time the
railroads do better in maintaining their property.
America has a freight rail network that is the envy of the
world, and that network helps make American businesses more
efficient, helping to create jobs. But there are also downsides
to the expansive network. Some of these downsides can be
mitigated with appropriate action, and I look forward to
hearing from our witnesses about their recommendations.

Mr. Lipinski. With that, I yield back, and I recognize
Ranking Member Crawford for his opening statement.
Mr. Crawford. Thank you, Chairman, for holding the hearing
today. I also want to thank our witnesses for being here today.
Railroad grade crossing safety, blocked crossings, railroad
trespassing, and rail suicides are serious issues that affect
the rail industry in many communities across America. According
to the Federal Railroad Administration, FRA, in the last 8
years, my home State of Arkansas experienced 76 total incidents
due to railroad trespassing, 28 of which were fatalities.
I know that complaints of blocked grade crossings have
amplified recently as well. I commend the FRA and Administrator
Batory for recognizing this problem and taking steps to fix it.
The rail industry has invested substantially in grade
crossing safety, including through the use of new technologies,
community education, and other deterrents to stop trespassers
and suicides on the tracks. Today we will hear about the FRA's
recent work to better monitor blocked crossings and to improve
rail crossing safety.
We will also hear from railroads, State and local leaders,
and other stakeholders about the problems they face with these
issues, their efforts to combat them, and future needs to
continue making improvements.
Finally, I would note the importance of Federal grants and
Federal funding opportunities through the section 130 program
and other grant programs that assist railroads, States, and
communities with grade crossing upgrades and improvements.
Thank you, once again, to all of our witnesses for being
here today. I look forward to hearing your testimony and
responses to questions.
[Mr. Crawford's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Eric A. ``Rick'' Crawford, a Representative
in Congress from the State of Arkansas, and Ranking Member,
Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials
Railroad grade crossing safety, blocked crossings, railroad
trespassing, and rail suicides are serious issues that affect the rail
industry and many communities across America.
According to the FRA, in the last eight years, my home state of
Arkansas experienced 76 total incidents due to railroad trespassing, 28
of which were fatalities.
I know that complaints of blocked grade crossings have amplified
recently. I commend the FRA and Administrator Batory for recognizing

programs that assist railroads, states and communities with grade
crossing upgrades and improvements.

Mr. Crawford. And with that, I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. Lipinski. Thank you, Ranking Member Crawford.
Let me call on Representative Napolitano to introduce Mr.
Mark Christoffels.
Mrs. Napolitano. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Members
Crawford and Graves, for inviting Mark Christoffels. I believe
Mark and his organization, the Alameda Corridor-East, are the
perfect witnesses for this very important hearing today
regarding grade crossing safety. ACE was formed 22 years ago by
30 cities in my district and surrounding region for the sole
purpose of improving grade crossing safety with grade
separation projects, and safety improvement projects.
Thirty cities banded together and they have found the most
important crossings to improve. They found the local, State,
and Federal funding that was needed and created their own
construction authority to build these projects. They are only a
few years away from being fully completed, and this is truly an
incredible achievement that has dramatically improved the
commute times and safety of our community, most of them on time
and under budget.
I want to thank the ACE board of directors and the staff of
Mark Christoffels, Paul Hubler, and all the team members who
work on this very important project. And thank you, Mark, for
being here today, and welcome.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Lipinski. Thank you. And I would like to hear from our
panel of witnesses. I would like to introduce Alderman Matt
O'Shea. Matt O'Shea has been an alderman of Chicago's 19th Ward
since 2011. He represents the communities of Beverly, Morgan
Park, and Mount Greenwood, in the Chicago City Council.
Like many communities I represent, the 19th Ward has
multiple sets of railroad tracks running through the community.
He knows firsthand the positives and negatives of railroads.
During his time as alderman, Matt has focused on improving
local public schools, stimulating economic development, and
enhancing public safety. He has been a strong advocate for the
19th Ward in dealing with some issues that have come up with
respect to railroads.
He is also the chair of the Aviation Committee in the
Chicago City Council.
Matt is a lifelong resident of the Beverly/Morgan Park
community and currently lives there with his wife Cara and
three children, Brigid, Patrick, and Eileen.
And I would like to welcome our entire panel of witnesses
now. Mr. Karl Alexy, Associate Administrator for Railroad
Safety and Chief Safety Officer, the Federal Railroad
Administration; Mr. Brian Vercruysse, rail safety program
administrator, Illinois Commerce Commission; Mr. Mark
Christoffels, chief engineer, San Gabriel Valley Council of
Governments/Alameda Corridor-East Project; Ms. Rachel Maleh,
executive director, Operation Lifesaver, Inc.; the Honorable
Matthew O'Shea, alderman, 19th Ward of Chicago, Chicago City
Council; and Mr. Jason Morris, assistant vice president, safety
and environmental, Norfolk Southern Corporation.
Thank you all for being here today. I look forward to your
testimony.
Without objection, our witnesses' full statements will be
included in the record. Since your written testimony has been
made part of the record, the subcommittee requests that you
limit your oral testimony to 5 minutes.
I will begin by recognizing Mr. Alexy for 5 minutes.

Mr. Alexy. Chairman Lipinski, Ranking Member Crawford, and
members of the subcommittee, good morning, and thank you for
the opportunity to speak with you today regarding highway-rail
grade crossing safety.
The mission of FRA is to enable the safe, reliable, and
efficient movement of people and goods for a strong America,
now and in the future. As such, safety is our top priority.
Railroads are a vital transportation link in our Nation's
economy, transporting freight and passengers in a manner not
achievable by other modes of transportation.
The safety of rail operations over highway-rail grade
crossings and trespassing on railroad rights-of-way are two
critical issues that FRA recognizes continue to impact and
concern communities. Trespassing on railroad property is the
leading cause of rail-related deaths in the United States.
Grade crossing incidents are the second.
Together these types of accidents account for 97 percent of
all fatalities along the Nation's rights-of-way. FRA believes
these accidents and resulting injuries and fatalities are
preventable. Grade crossing safety and trespassing prevention
are separate and distinct issues, yet they share two common
factors.
First, both are, with very few exceptions, a function of
human behavior, including decisionmaking. Motorists may decide
to disregard active grade crossing warning devices and maneuver
around lowered gates, or pedestrians seeking a shortcut may cut
across tracks.
Second, of the stakeholders--railroads, communities,
individuals, and regulators--none can solve this issue on its
own. We need all of the stakeholders to prioritize and address
these issues.
FRA is underway with implementing its National Strategy to
Prevent Trespassing on Railroad Property developed in 2018.
More recently, in November 2019, FRA developed and began
implementation of a business plan to advance grade crossing
safety.
These efforts are complementary and focus on five strategic
areas: enhancing our collaboration with and outreach to all
affected stakeholders; leveraging data to allocate our
resources most effectively; oversight and enforcement of the
rail industry, and engagement of State and local governments
and law enforcement; supporting research designed to improve
rail safety; and funding to support implementation of proven
strategies and testing of new approaches and technologies.
FRA has worked to enhance the agency's collaboration and
outreach with stakeholders on both grade crossing safety and
trespass prevention issues through a series of listening
sessions, summits, symposiums, targeted social media campaigns,
and community site visits.
FRA works with the railroads, State and local government,
law enforcement officials, signal equipment manufacturers and
technology companies, trade and advocacy groups, as well as DOT
experts outside of the FRA, to identify the most effective
methods of improving grade crossing safety and preventing
trespassing on railroad property.
To complement FRA's safety oversight and research
initiatives, Secretary Chao and Administrator Batory have
prioritized investment in grade crossing improvements through
the Department's various grant programs. For example, under
this administration, over 500 individual grade crossings have
been made safer through FRA's grant selections, most of this
through the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety
Improvements grant program.
Additionally, the Risk Reduction and System Safety program
rules will require railroads to analyze how trespasser
prevention and highway-rail grade crossing technology may help
mitigate risk. Once these rules are published and implemented,
FRA anticipates that the required analysis will provide
railroads a framework for utilizing technology to combat risk
associated with grade crossing and trespassers.
In addition to the grade crossing safety and trespass
prevention, FRA is engaged with the railroads and State and
local officials to address the impactful effects of railroad
operations in communities. In May of 2019, Administrator Batory
wrote the chief executive officers of the Class I railroads and
major railroad holding companies regarding the impacts of
quality of life associated with blocked crossings.
Administrator Batory specifically requested that each railroad
act to minimize the occurrence of blocked crossings.
On December 20, 2019, FRA launched a new online portal to
collect data regarding the scope of the blocked crossing issue.
The portal allows the public and public safety officials to
report information on the location, time, duration, and impacts
of the blocked crossings. This information will provide FRA
with needed insights to the extent and consequences of these
events.
In conclusion, FRA remains committed to continuing to lead,
promote, and strengthen efforts among stakeholders to increase
awareness of grade crossing safety issues, the potential
consequences of trespassing on railroad rights-of-way, and
existing and potential trespass prevention strategies.
Thank you again for this opportunity, and I look forward to
taking your questions.
[Mr. Alexy's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Karl Alexy, Associate Administrator for Railroad
Safety and Chief Safety Officer, Federal Railroad Administration
Chairman Lipinski, Ranking Member Crawford, and Members of the
Committee,
Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today regarding
highway-rail grade crossing safety. The mission of FRA is to enable the
safe, reliable, and efficient movement of people and goods for a strong
America, now and in the future. As such, safety is FRA's top priority.
Railroads are a vital transportation link in our Nation's economy--
transporting freight and passengers in a manner not achievable by other
modes of transportation.
The safety of rail operations over highway-rail grade crossings and
trespassing on railroad rights-of-way are two critical issues that FRA
recognizes continue to impact and concern communities. As FRA
Administrator Ronald Batory has previously discussed with this
Committee, trespassing on railroad property is the leading cause of all
rail-related deaths in the United States. Grade crossing incidents are
the second. Together these types of accidents account for 97 percent of
all fatalities along the nation's railroad rights-of-way. Over the past
thirty years grade crossing fatalities have decreased by over sixty
percent, but it is not enough. FRA believes these accidents, and
resulting injuries and fatalities are preventable. Thus, improving
grade crossing safety and preventing trespassing on railroad rights-of-
way are top priorities for FRA.
Grade crossing safety and trespassing prevention are separate and
distinct issues, yet they share two common factors. First, both are
singularly a function of human behavior. A motorist may decide to
disregard active grade crossing warning devices at a highway-rail grade
crossing and maneuver around lowered gates or past flashing lights and
enter a crossing, or a pedestrian seeking a shortcut to a destination
on the opposite side of a set of railroad tracks may cut across those
tracks. In other cases, individuals are not sufficiently careful or may
make poor judgements, or motorists may experience mechanical breakdowns
or encounter physical obstructions when attempting to cross railroad
tracks. Second, of the stakeholders--railroads, communities,
individuals, and regulators--none can solve these issues on its own. We
need all stakeholders to take action to prioritize, prevent, and
address these issues. Railroads need to be cognizant of how their
operations affect the communities through which they operate. Local law
enforcement officials need to prioritize, to the extent possible,
enforcement of vehicle traffic signals at highway-rail grade crossings
and trespassing laws, and strict prosecution of resulting citations.
Individual community members need to be aware of the consequences of
not complying with grade crossing warning signals or of trespassing on
railroad rights-of-way.
As Administrator Batory shared in his June 2019 testimony to this
Committee, FRA is focused on leading, promoting, and strengthening
efforts among all stakeholders to increase awareness of grade crossing
safety issues, the dangers of trespassing on railroad rights-of-way,
and existing and potential trespassing prevention strategies. With our
current focus, we are well underway with implementing FRA's National
Strategy to Prevent Trespassing on Railroad Property which FRA
developed in 2018. More recently, in November 2019, FRA developed and
began implementation of a Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Safety Business
Plan. These efforts are complementary and focus generally on five
strategic areas:
(1)  Enhancing our collaborations with and outreach to all affected
stakeholders;
(2)  Leveraging data to apply our resources most effectively;
(3)  Oversight and enforcement of the rail industry, and engagement
of state and local governments, and law enforcement, particularly in
trespass ``hot-spots'' or near accident-prone areas;
(4)  Supporting research designed to improve rail safety; and
(5)  Existing funding opportunities to support implementation of
proven strategies and testing of new approaches and technologies.

FRA has worked to enhance the agency's collaborations with and
outreach to stakeholders on both grade crossing safety and trespass
prevention issues through a series of listening sessions, summits,
symposiums, targeted social media campaigns, and community site visits.
FRA works with railroads, state and local governments, law enforcement
officials, signal equipment manufacturers and technology companies,
trade and advocacy groups, as well as DOT experts outside of FRA, to
identify the most effective methods of improving grade crossing safety
and preventing trespassing on railroad property.
FRA's safety program has historically been and continues to be
data-driven. Highway-rail grade crossing safety and trespassing
prevention are no exceptions, but as I noted earlier, both issues are
highly dependent not only on FRA data and actions, but on the
involvement of all affected stakeholders. Accordingly, FRA has
amplified its efforts to improve the quality of its data and to ensure
data related to grade crossing safety and trespassing incidents is
available and accessible to all stakeholders. For example, FRA has
created and maintains numerous data visualization tools (e.g.,
dashboards, maps) which enable the agency and our stakeholders to
better monitor and analyze key safety metrics over time. Meanwhile, FRA
is using analytical tools to gain a better understanding of factors
affecting grade crossing safety and trespassing issues (e.g., from
system-level overviews to localized detail). FRA is also seeking new
and unconventional data sources and voluntary methods of sharing data
among stakeholders to identify leading indicators of both grade
crossing and trespassing risk factors.
Utilizing available data, FRA is identifying accident-prone areas
and trespass ``hot-spots'' and engaging railroads operating in those
areas, as well as the relevant state and local government and law
enforcement officials, to seek potential local solutions to the risks.
The Grade Crossing Safety and Trespass Prevention research program
conducts research to improve safety at highway-rail grade crossings and
along the railroad rights-of-way. The program develops, tests, and
evaluates technologies and engineering solutions, and collects and
analyzes data to measure the effectiveness in improving grade crossing
safety. FRA is currently supporting research in several technologies
that have the potential to reduce grade crossing accidents, including
GIS mapping, use of drones, in-vehicle auditory alerts, intelligent
crossing assessment, and first responder blocked crossing
notifications. The research outcomes, reports, and best practices will
continue to be published on the FRA website and presented at industry
related conferences and workshops. FRA currently uses an online
research repository to store and maintain research reports and will
introduce a search engine to facilitate access to these reports.
To complement FRA's safety oversight and research initiatives,
Secretary Elaine L. Chao and Administrator Batory have prioritized
investment in grade crossing improvements through the Department's
various grant programs. Under this Administration, in addition to grade
crossing formula funding administered by the Federal Highway
Administration's Section 130 program, over 500 individual grade
crossings have been made safer through FRA grant selections, most of
this through the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety
Improvements (CRISI) grant program. The Department's Better Utilizing
Investments to Leverage Development (BUILD) and Infrastructure for
Rebuilding America (INFRA) grant programs have also provided
significant investment in grade crossing safety nationwide.
Regarding trespassing, FRA issued two Notices of Funding
Opportunities (NOFO) for law enforcement agencies to address railroad
trespassing enforcement. In response to the first NOFO, FRA awarded
almost $200,000 to four law enforcement agencies. Preliminary findings
demonstrate a significant reduction in trespassing incidents in these
four local jurisdictions. Applications in response to the second NOFO
are currently under review. Looking forward, FRA expects to make its
fiscal year 2020 grant funding available to prospective applicants in
the near future. We encourage your states and communities to apply for
these forthcoming funding opportunities so they can work with FRA and
continue to make grade crossings safer and reduce trespasser incidents.
Trespassing Prevention
Trespassing on railroad property can be defined as accessing
private railroad property anywhere other than at a designated
pedestrian or roadway crossing. Trespassing on private railroad
property is illegal and poses a grave threat to the individual
trespasser's safety and to the safety of railroad employees. Although
this is a matter of common sense, each year, more than 500 people are
killed and nearly as many injured, while trespassing on railroad
property.
Implementation of FRA's National Trespassing Prevention Strategy is
well underway. To date, FRA has consistently achieved the milestones
set forth in the Strategy and the agency will provide a specific update
on its progress implementing the Strategy later this year. To highlight
some of the successes of the Strategy to date, I note:

FRA field teams have conducted 171 trespassing site
visits and outreach presentations since October of 2018.

FRA developed a Trespass and Suicide Dashboard that
allows users to visually interact with trespass and suicide data
collected by FRA. The Dashboard is designed to provide key information
to enable analysis of the data, including where trespassing incidents
have occurred both nationally and locally, what railroads are involved
in the trespassing incidents, and key factual details surrounding the
trespassing incidents (e.g., trespasser age, day of week, time of day,
physical act before casualty, and the event that caused the casualty).
Although FRA's field teams use this information to evaluate local
conditions and track overall trends, the dashboard is available online
for all stakeholders to use.

Regional FRA teams are working with individual
communities identified as ``hot-spots'' for trespassing incidents to
understand the root causes of the incidents and assist in the
development of local solutions.

FRA issued an approximately $160,000 Consolidated Rail
Infrastructure and Safety Improvements (CRISI) grant to the Florida
Department of Transportation to pilot drone technology, closed circuit
television with remote monitoring, and a geographic information system
spatial analysis to aid and leverage local law enforcement trespassing
enforcement efforts.

FRA has worked with the leaders of the 10-counties in the
United States with the most trespassing incidents to participate in
Railroad Trespassing and Grade Crossing Technology Summits throughout
the country in 2020.
Grade Crossing
Similar to trespassing, human behavior plays a primary role in
grade crossing accidents. For example, a driver may choose to maneuver
around lowered gates at an active crossing, or a driver may fail to
look both ways to ensure the track is clear before attempting to cross
a passive crossing (a passive crossing is a crossing with no train-
activated warning devices).
Throughout the past year, FRA held a series of six grade crossing
technology listening sessions. Those listening sessions involved a
diverse range of stakeholders, including rail industry members, state
and local governments (including law enforcement officials), trade and
advocacy groups, as well as signal equipment and automobile
manufacturers and technology companies, and culminated in a Grade
Crossing Symposium in November, 2019. The Symposium provided a forum
for all stakeholders to share what they learned during the listening
sessions and collaborate on issues and experiences in implementing both
low-tech and high-tech grade crossing solutions and best practices that
have been successful on a local level to reduce grade crossing
accidents as well as strategies for overcoming barrier to
implementation and funding sources. FRA plans to continue this
collaboration and outreach with stakeholders by holding additional
grade crossing summits during 2020 to engage locally with stakeholders.
As I noted earlier, in November 2019, FRA issued its Highway-Rail
Grade Crossing Business Plan as a complement to FRA's Trespassing
Prevention Strategy. This Business Plan describes the actions FRA will
take over the next three years to support the implementation of
technology to improve grade crossing safety. The Business Plan outlines
FRA's technological approach to grade crossing safety and emphasizes
FRA's continued desire to FRA to work with all stakeholders to discover
new and innovative ways to use technology to mitigate and eliminate
grade crossing collisions. FRA recognizes the costs to communities to
implement technologies at grade crossings, and accordingly, one focus
of the Business Plan is identifying available funding opportunities
through existing programs at FRA and other DOT modes (e.g., the Federal
Highway Administration).
In addition to developing the Business Plan, since Administrator
Batory last testified before this Committee in June 2019, FRA has taken
several additional actions to address and engage stakeholders in grade
crossing safety issues, including actions to ensure the safety of
railroad operations in quiet zones. Examples of these actions include:

In November 2019, FRA published a notice of proposed
rulemaking (NPRM) responding to the FAST Act's mandate to require 40
States and the District of Columbia to develop and implement highway-
rail grade crossing action plans. Consistent with the statutory
mandate, the NPRM also proposed to require the ten States previously
required to develop highway-rail grade crossing actions plans to update
their plans and submit reports to FRA describing the actions they have
taken to implement them. FRA is currently reviewing comments received
in response to the NPRM and anticipates publication of a Final Rule in
the summer.

Observing an increase in accidents at grade crossings
within quiet zones, in December 2019, FRA wrote to all public
authorities with quiet zones in which multiple accidents occurred in
2018 to remind those entities of the importance of ensuring their quiet
zones comply with the conditions of approval. To ensure future
compliance, FRA implemented a standard operating procedure to inspect
all established quiet zones (currently 907) on a three-year or less
interval and to inspect newly established quiet zones within the first
60 days.

Additionally, the Risk Reduction and System Safety Program rules
will require railroads to analyze how trespasser prevention technology
and highway-rail grade crossing technology may help mitigate identified
risks. Once these rules are published and implemented, FRA anticipates
that the required analysis will provide railroads a framework for
utilizing technology to combat risks associated with grade crossings
and trespassers.
In addition to grade crossing safety and trespassing prevention,
the FRA is engaged with the railroads and state and local officials to
address the sometimes impactful effects of railroad operations on
communities.
In May, noting an increase in the number of blocked crossing
complaints FRA was receiving, Administrator Batory wrote to the Chief
Executive Officers and senior leadership of the Class I railroads and
major railroad holding companies regarding the impacts to quality of
life associated with blocked crossings. Administrator Batory
specifically requested that each railroad take action to minimize the
occurrence of blocked crossings and redouble their efforts to work with
states and local communities to advance the safety and efficiency of
both railroad and highway transportation. In December, I wrote to all
736 railroads operating in the United States, reiterating Administrator
Batory's requests.
On December 20, 2019 FRA launched a new online portal to collect
data regarding the scope of blocked crossings issues across the
country. The portal allows the public and public safety officials to
submit reports of blocked crossings and specifically requests
information on the location of the blocked crossing, and the time,
duration, and impacts of the blocked crossing. This information will
provide FRA with more standardized data on instances of blocked
crossings throughout the United States and FRA will analyze the data
and publicly share it with all affected stakeholders to help inform the
development of local solutions to reduce and prevent incidents of
trains blocking crossings.
Conclusion
FRA will continue to effectively implement its National Strategy to
Prevent Trespassing on Railroad Property and carry out its Highway-Rail
Grade Crossing Safety Business Plan. The agency remains committed to
continuing to lead, promote, and strengthen efforts among all
stakeholders to increase awareness of grade crossing safety issues, the
potential consequences of trespassing on railroad rights-of-way, and
existing and potential trespassing prevention strategies.

Mr. Lipinski. Thank you, Mr. Alexy.
I now recognize Mr. Vercruysse for 5 minutes.
Mr. Vercruysse. Good morning, Chairman Lipinski, Ranking
Member Crawford, Chairman DeFazio, and all of the honorable
members of this subcommittee. I am here on behalf of the
Illinois Commerce Commission to share challenges facing us with
our rail safety efforts at public highway-rail crossings. We
are very grateful for this opportunity.
Illinois has nearly 7,600 at-grade crossings and over 2,600
highway-rail bridges. Nationally, Illinois is only second to
Texas in the number of crossings. With over 60 railroad
companies operating on approximately 7,400 miles of track, our
rail system is the country's second largest, including the
largest rail freight hub in the city of Chicago with 1,200
trains per day.
In 1955, Illinois created the Grade Crossing Protection
Fund to assist in paying for safety improvements at public
highway-rail crossings. To date, $991 million has been
authorized under the direction of the Illinois Commerce
Commission towards warning device upgrades, bridges, and many
other safety projects.
We have seen significant accident reduction over the long
term with all of our partners from the communities and
railroads. However, in the last 10 years, we have seen accident
rates plateau, and even in certain instances creep a little
higher. Our State funding, along with Federal funding sources,
provide an opportunity to complete many more projects as well
as address safety concerns that have demanded our attention but
have lacked solutions for a variety of reasons.
As I highlight three main areas of concern today, there is
no doubt that funding is needed, but it alone will not suffice.
Loss of shunt is a primary concern for the State of Illinois,
where the crossing signal and warning devices have failed to
properly detect certain trains. With advances in diagnostic
tools, it was determined that this problem, which is infrequent
and difficult to isolate, is not unique to Illinois.
In response, extensive testing is ongoing, with adjustments
made to warning devices, signal systems, and train speeds.
Further work is planned. Ultimately, though, we believe there
is a need to push towards and fund the next generation of
Positive Train Control that activates warning devices and
provides for more functionality in train signaling.
Blocked crossings present another significant public safety
concern that creates serious access problems for communities
and help to create unsafe behavior at crossings. We have seen
pedestrians crawl through trains and motorists drive around
lowered gates to avoid long delays, as well as other concerns.
We have also received complaints from our citizens and
first responders. This has increased with the rollout of the
FRA's blocked crossing reporting website.
We have found changes in rail operations that have
aggravated existing conditions or create new impacts where
crossings are blocked consistently for 10 minutes to multiple
hours, and in rare, infrequent cases, we have had days.
Railroad personnel inexperience, unfamiliarity with an area,
insufficient rail infrastructure, mechanical breakdown,
regulatory requirements, and train length are the reasons
typically found in our inspections.
Blocked crossings in Illinois have also been well
documented in the cases before the Surface Transportation Board
when approval is requested for a railroad's sale, lease, or
other transaction. We believe the reports required from
railroads and STB dockets provide the most valuable information
relative to operations, length of train, blocked crossings, and
the status of warning devices.
In 2008, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that an Illinois
statute prohibiting the blocking of a crossing was
unconstitutional and preempted by Federal law. The Illinois
statute provided requirements for interactions within emergency
vehicles and included increasing fines based upon time
intervals for obstructions over 10 minutes.
With similar findings in other States, we believe that
Federal legislation is necessary to bridge the gap between
preemptive State laws and the STB's authority on blocked
crossings, instead of waiting for case-by-case issues that
arise that create immediate negative impacts.
Trespassing and suicide along rail lines in Illinois are
also significant issues. It is a problem that has been present
for the past 30 years and accounts for approximately 30
fatalities and 25 injuries per year each. That is for
trespassing and suicide. Each sees approximately 30 fatalities.
Recent studies by the FRA identified that 75 percent of
trespassing incidents happened within 1,000 feet of a grade
crossing. To address this and other hotspots, we are working
with our State lawmakers to expand funding to allow for
assistance with trespass mitigation.
There are other areas to address and improve that I have
included in my written testimony. We believe that the section
of warning devices and other improvements at a grade crossing
should be based upon the best available technology and based
upon corridor reviews.
The use of four-quadrant gates provides an example as it
addresses 25 percent of all crashes we see in Illinois where
motorists drive around the gates. Also, for project
development, we see challenges for communities in meeting
funding match requirements, and we have experienced what
appears to be a pullback by many railroads in providing
resources to address public works projects.
Further, some railroad requirements regarding project
scope, cost, design, agreements, and operations during
construction have led to requests that may not coincide with
the needs of a specific location.
Thank you again for providing me this opportunity to
highlight the activities and concerns in Illinois. While I
represent the Illinois Commerce Commission, I am also a member
of the Association of State Rail Safety Managers, which
includes 30 States plus the District of Columbia.
While Illinois has many unique operating considerations,
the concerns I have discussed today are common across much of
the country.
Thank you.
[Mr. Vercruysse's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Brian Vercruysse, P.E., Rail Safety Program
Administrator, Illinois Commerce Commission
Good morning Chairman Lipinski, Ranking Member Crawford, Chairman
DeFazio, Representative Davis, and all the honorable members of this
subcommittee. I am here on behalf of the Illinois Commerce Commission
and the State of Illinois to share our history, recent experience, and
the challenges facing us with our safety efforts at public highway-rail
crossings. We are very grateful for this opportunity.
Illinois Transportation Network--Public Highway-Rail Crossings
Illinois has 7,595 public highway-rail grade crossings and 2,667
highway-rail bridges. There are also 323 pedestrian grade crossings and
104 pedestrian bridges. Nationally, Illinois is second only to Texas in
the total number of highway-rail crossings. With over 60 railroad
companies operating on approximately 7,400 miles of railroad track, our
rail system is the country's second largest, including the nation's
largest rail freight hub in Chicago with approximately 1,200 trains per
day.
History--Illinois Commerce Commission
Next year the Illinois Commerce Commission celebrates its 100th
anniversary in its current format from 1921, and for Illinois it also
marks the 150th anniversary of addressing rail safety concerns that
started with our predecessors--the Railroad and Warehouse Commission of
1871. The Illinois Commerce Commission was one of, if not the first
entity, to fund the installation of warning devices at crossings on a
corridor basis; and in 1955, the State of Illinois passed legislation
creating the Grade Crossing Protection Fund to assist public agencies
in paying for safety improvements at highway-rail crossings on local
roads and streets. Funding levels have increased since 1955, and today
$42 million is provided annually towards crossing safety improvements
at public highway-rail crossings. The array of projects completed
include warning device upgrades, bridges, traffic signal interconnects,
highway approaches, crossing closures, surface renewals, and the
development of newer technologies at public highway-rail crossings.
The State of Illinois has authorized $991M towards these types of
safety projects through the Grade Crossing Protection Fund. With this
state funding, and the federal funding provided through the Section 130
fund (approximately $11M per year), the State of Illinois and its
community and railroad partners have seen significant long term returns
in the way of accident reduction--though recent returns have diminished
as we have seen accident rates plateau and even creep back higher in
the last ten years. But I am happy to report that many further safety
improvements are planned. The State of Illinois Capital Plan passed in
2019 will provide an additional $78M towards highway-rail crossing
safety over the next 5 years. This funding provides an opportunity to
continue with the types of projects mentioned previously but could also
help address safety concerns that have demanded our attention but have
lacked solutions for a variety of reasons. Specifically, these concerns
involve 1) conventional track circuits with loss of shunt; 2) blocked
crossings; 3) trespassing; 4) best available technology; and 5) project
development and coordination. As I describe each of these in more
detail, there is no doubt that funding is needed--but it alone will not
suffice. Legislative changes at the state and federal levels are
required, as well as a push towards the best available or next
generation of crossing warning systems.
1. loss of shunt
Loss of Shunt is a primary concern for the State of Illinois. The
Illinois Commerce Commission first became aware of this issue 15 years
ago where the crossing signal and warning device systems failed to
properly detect some approaching passenger trains. This has led to
Activation Failures where the warning devices or gates failed to
provide adequate warning to motorists, or in the worst case, the gates
never come down as a train goes through a grade crossing. With advances
in diagnostic tools, it was determined in recent years that this
problem, which is infrequent and difficult to isolate, is not unique
only to Illinois but is widespread. In response, extensive testing and
investigation is ongoing with adjustments being made to warning
devices, train signal systems, train speeds, and other modifications.
The changes have helped alleviate the issues, but the problem persists.
The Illinois Commerce Commission is working with various railroads, the
Illinois Department of Transportation, Amtrak, and FRA to fund a
demonstration project in 2020 and 2021 to test a product new to the
United States. We believe there is a need to push towards and fund the
next generation of Positive Train Control that activates warning
devices at highway-rail crossings and provides more functionality in
train signaling and that does not predominately rely on conventional
track circuits first used in the late 1800's. This will provide the
additional safe method of train detection needed for those Loss of
Shunt conditions that occur with light/fast commuter operations and
freight train movements that are caused by rail contamination. We also
believe that changes should be made in 49 CFR 234.9 requiring the
reporting of Activation Failures within 24 hours, which is consistent
with reporting accidents involving grade crossing signal failure (49
CFR 234.7).
2. blocked crossings
Blocked Crossings present another significant public safety concern
in Illinois. They create serious access problems for emergency
responders, affect school bus routings, and disrupt the general flow of
vehicular traffic throughout a community. We have seen pedestrians
crawl through trains, parents pass children through trains, motorists
drive around lowered gates to avoid long delays, and even lift roadway
gates where a train was stopped clear of the road but still activating
the warning devices. We have also heard from our citizens and Emergency
Services agencies on their concerns for overall public safety, access,
and response. This has been heightened with the December 15th rollout
of FRA's Blocked Crossing Reporting Portal. As of January 30th, there
were over 500 submissions from Illinois alone (60% of all reports).
The larger industrial areas of our state (Chicagoland, Illinois
portion of the St. Louis Metro area, Decatur, for example) are the
locations that have historically heavy volumes for both train and auto
traffic. For these locations, bridges, connecting roads, or other
infrastructure improvements have been built to help alleviate the
highway/rail transportation conflict. In certain areas, communication
and emergency plans have been prepared. These actions must continue,
and we plan to do so. But we have also found changes in rail operations
that have aggravated conditions or create impacts new to communities
that may now see their highway-rail crossings blocked consistently for
10 minutes to multiple hours; and in the extreme but infrequent cases,
days. Railroad personnel inexperience or unfamiliarity with an area,
insufficient siding length, timing of train meets, lack of yard
capacity, lining switches, mechanical breakdown, crew hours of service,
and increased train length are the reasons typically found or stated
for obstruction of crossings.
While there is no specific public data available on train length,
the Illinois Commerce Commission reviewed 40 years of FRA data on
freight train and vehicle collisions at mainline grade crossings. The
FRA reports include the number of cars and locomotives in use at the
time of the crash. The analysis shows increases in average train length
since 1980, with an approximately 25% increase in the last ten years
alone to an average length over a mile long. This is consistent with
the May 2019 GAO study on train length with data provided by two Class
I railroads. The GAO noted that train accidents have declined according
to the Federal Railroad Administration's data, with train accidents per
million-train-miles decreasing by about 14 percent between 2008 and
2017. However, we have reviewed 2010 to 2019 FRA data, and have found
the accident rate has increased 10.4% for grade crossing incidents and
51% for trespasser incidents. Further, when the GAO study was
published, we reviewed the FRA's Train Accident/Incident file to look
at crashes involving locomotives used as Distributed Power Units
(DPUs). These units, utilized at the mid and/or rear of a train are
used for the additional power necessary to run trains up to 3 miles or
more in length. From 2008 to 2018, approximately 12% of incidents
involved DPU-equipped trains. In Illinois, we regularly see trains
approaching 2 miles long, with less frequent trains closer to 3 miles
in length. Other than our observations and inspections, the use of
longer trains in Illinois has been well documented in cases before the
Surface Transportation Board (STB) when approval is requested for a
railroad sale, lease, or other transaction.
We have found that the reports required from railroads in STB
dockets provide the most valuable information relative to operations,
length of train, blocked crossings, and the status of warning devices.
This is the only area within federal or state law where reporting,
assessment of impacts, and development of mitigation measures
associated with blocked crossings are formally addressed.
State Laws on blocked crossing, while still in place, have been
preempted. In 2008, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that an Illinois
statute prohibiting the blocking of a highway-rail crossing and
allowing a community to issue tickets to rail carriers was
unconstitutional and preempted by the Federal Railroad Safety Act of
1994 and the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995.
The Illinois statute structure provided and included requirements for
interactions with emergency vehicles, and included increasing fines
based upon time intervals for obstructions over ten minutes. At the
lower end with an obstruction under 15 minutes, the fine is $200 to
$500; at the higher end for over 35 minutes the fine is $1000 as well
as $500 for each additional 5 minutes of obstruction. From 2009 to
2018, similar laws from other states were met with federal preemption
findings, and a 2019 Oklahoma law is currently under a Federal
Injunction.
With little federal oversight and no state authority, there are no
tools to incentivize or deter railroads from blocking crossings. When
blocked crossing issues do appear or are heightened, coordination with
railroads, communities, the FRA, and other stakeholders has helped in
certain instances, but the solutions are not always collaborative or
equitable to all parties. Moreover, where a problem area was addressed,
a new challenge may be created at crossings elsewhere on the line, or
reappear with new personnel, customers, or other operational changes.
We believe that federal legislation is necessary to bridge the gap
between preempted state laws and the STB's authority on blocked
crossings, and to provide consistent direction instead of waiting for
case-by-case issues to arise that create immediate negative impacts to
public safety and convenience. Ultimately, our desire is to work
collaboratively with communities, railroads, and the FRA to provide
infrastructure improvements that allow for safe and enhanced rail and
highway operations.
3. trespassing and suicide
Trespassing and suicide along rail lines in Illinois are also
significant concerns. It is a problem that has been present for the
past 30 plus years and accounts for approximately 30 fatalities and 25
injuries per year, leaving so many people impacted. Recent studies by
the FRA identified that 75% of trespassing incidents happen within 500
to 1000 feet of a grade crossing. To address this and other hot spots,
we have been working with our state lawmakers to expand funding from
our Grade Crossing Protection Fund to allow for assistance with
trespassing mitigation, as well as the construction of more bridges to
meet community demand for safer pedestrian and commuter accommodations.
The bill was just introduced last week as IL House Bill 4248.
4. use of best available technology and corridor reviews
While we pursue the next generation of Positive Train Control and
integration with grade crossings, we have current equipment that is
proven and provides the best available technology. For Illinois, the
use of four quadrant gates with vehicle detection provides an example.
There are 178 four quadrant gate locations in the State of Illinois
that seal the entire crossing and use vehicle detection to avoid
entrapment of a motorist on a crossing. The first installations were
completed in 2001, and the latest location completed in 2018.
Commission Staff believes that the installation of four quadrant gates
should be the goal when installing, renewing, or making significant
changes to crossings within mixed commuter and freight corridors in the
Chicago region, or other complex areas in the country. In Illinois
where nearly 25% of crashes stem from motorists driving around gates,
we believe four quadrant gates provide the best available technology.
Staff believes that any additional cost concerns are outweighed by the
greater safety benefit with four quadrant gates compared to just
upgrading or renewing a crossing to two quadrant gates. Along with the
use of best available technology, we also believe corridor reviews
should be conducted in the overall analysis when determining
improvements for grade crossings.
5. project coordination & challenges
In Illinois we have seen challenges for communities in meeting
funding match requirements. In response, the Commission has increased
assistance for signal projects, and we are currently reviewing reducing
the match for other types of projects. We are also aware of Section 130
match concerns, and the desire for more funding for bridge projects.
In addition, we have experienced what appears to be a pullback by
many railroads in providing resources to address public works projects.
This has led to delay in finalizing plans, estimates, reviews, and
agreements. Further, some railroad requirements regarding project
scope, cost, design, and operations during construction have led to
unreasonable requests that do not coincide with the needs of a specific
location. Again, this contributes to project delays, wasted resources,
increased costs, and in some cases, projects may not be pursued.
Thank you again for providing me this opportunity to highlight the
activities and concerns in Illinois. While I represent the Illinois
Commerce Commission, I am also a member of the Association of State
Rail Safety Managers that includes 30 States and the District of
Columbia. While Illinois has many unique operating considerations, the
concerns I've discussed today are common across much of the country.

Mr. Lipinski. Thank you, Mr. Vercruysse.
I now recognize Mr. Christoffels for 5 minutes.
Mr. Christoffels. Good morning, subcommittee Chairman
Lipinski and subcommittee Ranking Member Crawford and
distinguished Members. We appreciate the opportunity to share
almost two decades of working towards essentially zero tracking
on railroad crossing improvements.
I have an exhibit up there. What I am going to do is
quickly go through the what, the why, the status of our
project, and of course the funding. This map identifies where
we are located. We are the San Gabriel Valley Council of
Governments, a joint powers authority of 30 cities located in
the eastern part of L.A. County, representing almost 2 million
residents.
[Slide shown.]
It is the green area shaded on the map that is before you.
As you can see, you have the two ports of L.A. and Long Beach,
a major port destination for the entire Nation. Forty percent
of anything imported by water into the United States comes
through those two ports, as well as 25 percent of anything
exported from the United States exits through those ports.
Most of those cargo containers are put on rail, and as you
can see will travel up towards Los Angeles and then head due
east through the San Gabriel Valley. We typically see anywhere
between 100 and 180 trains coming through. This is an economic
engine for the United States, and it is important. As was
stated earlier in the intro statement, goods movement and what
we do here is essential to our competitiveness, but we also
have to realize that these rail activities have consequences
for the local communities.
Could I have the second exhibit, please?
[Slide shown.]
This is what happens when you combine an intense rail
traffic activity in a very heavily urbanized environment. And
as you can see in the upper left, we get rail stacking, maybe
not full blocking, but it doesn't take much for a 1- or a 1\1/
2\-mile-long freight train to come through, combined with
arterial streets that may have up to 40,000 cars a day, to
cause stacking.
We typically see up to 2,000 vehicle-hour delays, meaning
it is the equivalent of 2,000 vehicles idling for an hour. In a
nonattainment area like southern California, in addition to the
inconvenience to the motorists, this is causing an
environmental impact as well.
And then, what was stated earlier from the gentleman to the
right of me, you get a motorist's frustration. We have all
experienced sitting at an impacted traffic signal where you
have gone through one traffic signal and then it turns red and
you still haven't gotten through it. And then it goes an inch
up again, and you get that second shot, and then you get--and
what you see after a while is that motorists are so frustrated
they are running the red lights.
What we were experiencing in the San Gabriel Valley is
people so frustrated they were driving around the gates. They
weren't going to wait any longer for that rail, and, obviously,
resulting in accidents.
On the lower right, we have the issue of pedestrians. A lot
of these railroads cross areas where schoolchildren have to get
back and forth between their schools. That, in itself, causes
an issue as the children are desperate to get to class on time.
And then, on the lower left is something that is not spoken of
much, and that would be your vehicle response.
Lives are lost due to accidents on these crossings, but
lives are also lost to the inability of our first responders to
get to a response call in a timely manner. Here you see a
paramedic unit waiting for a slow-moving train. I will share in
this particular instance this had to call for a backup unit for
an emergency response on the other side in a different city.
Fortunately, the individual that had called for service was
responded to in a timely manner.
Could I have the next slide, please?
[Slide shown.]
This is a blowup of our area. We have 55 crossings located
within the San Gabriel Valley. What we have been doing for the
last 20 years is improving these crossings. For those that have
minimum vehicle counts and can't justify spending upwards of
$100 million to do a physical grade separation, we have been
doing the improvements that you have heard earlier--testimony
from the gentleman to the right--we have been installing four-
quadrant gates, pedestrian gates, warning lights, signal
interconnects, any ability to make sure that the motorists
can't drive around and stops adequately for the crossings.
Nineteen of these, due to heavy vehicle volume, justified
physical grade separation. Right now, we have completed 14 of
those 19. I have three in construction, and the remaining two
in design. The total cost for this has been $1.8 billion in
funding.
And we are well on our way, as stated by Grace Napolitano,
on completing this ambitious program. I have to credit the 30
member agencies to start this program 20 years ago, to realize
that rail traffic was going to increase substantially, and
everything that they had been witnessing was going to increase
dramatically. They had a lot of foresight to go and start this
very ambitious program to increase rail safety.
We do get calls from all the way across the Nation, as they
are now experiencing something similar, especially in Chicago,
and asking, ``How did you guys do it? Where did you get the
funding? How did you get all of this organized?'' And we are
proud to share those experiences with you.
What I would like to talk a little bit is about the
funding. Obviously, to implement a program this ambitious
requires a lot of funding. When we first started, we were
getting Federal funding up to 80 percent of the cost of these
grade separations. I can tell you today the Federal
contribution to our grade separations is down near 15 percent.
The Federal funding allocated to this type of program
activity has diminished and can't keep up with demand. During
the last INFRA call for projects, DOT will tell you that there
was upwards of $12 in applications for every $1 that was
available. That tells you what kind of increasing demand we are
having out there to physically separate our rail activity, our
commerce activity, from the individual cities that are being
impacted.
And I want to emphasize that. We look at a lot of our
infrastructure funding on increasing the ability to move goods
from point A to point B. But sometimes we have to take a step
back and say, ``At what price are we doing that? Are we
mitigating the impacts of what we are doing?''
I can increase the rail activity. I can put my throughput
in there. But these cities that are being impacted by the
delays caused by the increased rail activity, we need to make
aware that we have to mitigate that. We have to go back and
grade separate these crossings, so that those individual
communities won't experience what I showed you earlier in those
photographs.
The problem that we see--and we have experienced in the
L.A. area--as the greatest impacts on these communities is in
the most heavily urbanized environment. And if you think about
an area like L.A., one-third of my project cost is land
acquisition. You are in a heavily urbanized area that is fully
developed with skyrocketing land costs.
On a $100 million project, I could spend one-third of that
money on land acquisition. When you look at the benefit-cost
ratio of us competing nationally for funding in a program that
will fund grade separations, we don't rank very well because
our costs are so extraordinarily high compared to the normal
measure of benefit, which would be vehicle prevention of
accidents and that sort of thing.
And one of the things that I would ask that this
subcommittee----
Mr. Lipinski. Mr. Christoffels, if you can wrap up, we can
come back to some questions.
Mr. Christoffels. Sure. Would be to look at the funding
opportunities and to increase them.
With that, thank you.
[Mr. Christoffels' prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Mark Christoffels, Chief Engineer, San Gabriel
Valley Council of Governments
Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member Graves, Subcommittee Chairman
Lipinski, Subcommittee Ranking Member Crawford and Distinguished
Members of the Subcommittee:
I am Mark Christoffels, Chief Engineer for the San Gabriel Valley
Council of Governments (SGVCOG), a California joint powers authority
made up of representatives from 30 cities, three Los Angeles County
Supervisorial Districts and three municipal water districts located in
the San Gabriel Valley, a region of 2 million residents in eastern Los
Angeles County.
In response to a grade crossing study of the Alameda Corridor-East
(ACE) Trade Corridor in Southern California, the SGVCOG established the
ACE Construction Authority in 1998. This single-purpose construction
authority was charged with implementing a rail crossing improvement
program intended to mitigate vehicle delays, collisions and other
community impacts at 55 at-grade rail-roadway crossings in anticipation
of growing freight rail traffic in the San Gabriel Valley. This
initiative has developed into a comprehensive $1.8 billion program of
rail-highway grade separations and crossing safety improvements along
the ACE Trade Corridor, which is among California's and the Nation's
busiest rail corridors.
The transcontinental rail lines that comprise the ACE Trade
Corridor accommodate significant, and growing, freight carried between
the American heartland and our nation's busiest port complex in the San
Pedro Bay. Together, the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach handle
more than 40 percent of all shipping containers arriving by ocean
vessel on our shores and 25 percent of America's exports. These cargo
volumes result in more than 180 Union Pacific Railroad and BNSF trains
per day traversing the ACE Trade Corridor, carrying 16% of all the
Nation's waterborne containerized freight (See Exhibit 1). In addition,
dozens of daily Metrolink regional commuter trains operate on the
freight rail mainlines under shared-use agreements.

The ever-increasing freight train traffic along the ACE Trade
Corridor has resulted in traffic queueing and delays at at-grade
crossings as well as deaths and injuries from crossing collisions.
Twenty years ago, the ACE Trade Corridor crossing improvement plan
evaluated all at-grade crossings in the San Gabriel Valley and proposed
building grade separations, where the road goes under or over the
railroad, at the most congested and hazardous crossings. These
improvements would enhance crossing safety, eliminate vehicle delay
throughout the local roadway network and locomotive horn noise, and
reduce vehicle emissions in Southern California, a Federal air quality
nonattainment area (see Exhibit 2). In response, the ACE Construction
Authority created a comprehensive strategy to fund and implement the
study's recommendations.
exhibit 2

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Clockwise from top left, traffic queuing at the Montebello Boulevard
crossing; collision at Nogales Street crossing; pedestrians in Pomona;
paramedics blocked by train at Turnbull Canyon Road crossing.

Armed with this plan of action, the SGVCOG and the ACE Construction
Authority came to Capitol Hill in 1998 during consideration of the
Transportation Efficiency Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) legislation
to request Federal funding for the implementation of the ACE Program.
In the context of the recently ratified North American Free Trade
Agreement and the resulting need to improve our Nation's goods movement
infrastructure, Congress recognized the importance of the ACE Program
to this effort by designating the ACE Trade Corridor as a National High
Priority Corridor and awarding approximately $133 million for the
proposed rail-roadway improvements.
In 2005, Congress continued its strong support for the ACE Program
in the next transportation reauthorization (SAFETEA-LU) by designating
the ACE Trade Corridor as one of only 25 Projects of National and
Regional Significance and providing $67 million in funding. In
addition, $17 million in funding was allocated to ACE projects during
the annual appropriations process between 2000 to 2010, as well as an
additional $28 million in other Federal funding.
exhibit 3

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

This Federal recognition and funding served as an important
catalyst for the substantial subsequent investment of more than $1.5
billion in California state and local funding which has made the full
funding of the $1.8 billion ACE Program achievable in the near term, if
we are able to secure approximately $70 million to complete a
programmatic funding shortfall.
Chairman DeFazio may recall touring the ACE Trade Corridor by
helicopter in early 2009, along with representatives of the SGVCOG, the
Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach and the Alameda Corridor
Transportation Authority, during a visit to the Los Angeles region for
a joint field hearing hosted by this Subcommittee and the Highways and
Transit Subcommittee. That hearing was titled ``Confronting Freight
Challenges in Southern California.''

We are pleased to report significant progress since the Chairman's
visit. As of today, we have completed and opened to traffic 14 grade
separations, are currently under construction on another three grade
separations and are preparing to award construction contracts for our
final two grade separations this year or next year (see Exhibits 3 and
4). We have also closed or eliminated three grade crossings and
installed safety measures at the remaining crossings, such as four-
quadrant gates or center medians to deter motorists from driving around
lowered crossing gates.
There have been 128 collisions at the 19 crossings which already
are or will be grade separated in eastern Los Angeles County, according
to our review of Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) crossing
collision records. These collisions resulted in at least 26 fatalities
and 46 injuries. Grade separations will eliminate crossing collisions
at these busy streets as well as a total of more than 2,000 vehicle-
hours of daily delay at the San Gabriel Valley's blocked crossings,
including for emergency responders.
We are grateful for the strong support of Congress and the Federal
Government for our ambitious plan to mitigate the substantial and
negative impacts of ever-increasing freight rail traffic through the
San Gabriel Valley. While this support has been instrumental in
initiating the ACE Program, as the state of California and the County
of Los Angeles have subsequently provided robust freight project funds,
the share of our Federal contribution has declined to less than 15
percent, or $244 million of the $1.8 billion secured. This stands in
stark contrast to the traditional 80 percent Federal to 20 percent
State or local funding ratio for such infrastructure improvements. The
substantial national economic benefits of an efficient goods movement
network and the resulting negative impact on our local communities
warrant a much higher level of Federal assistance for programs like the
ACE Program.
In this context, we helped establish the Coalition for America's
Gateways and Trade Corridors (CAGTC) nearly 20 years ago to advocate
for sufficient funding in Federal legislation for trade corridors,
gateways, intermodal connectors and freight facilities. We were pleased
that Congress established a national freight program and authorized the
expenditure of substantial funding to support freight infrastructure
improvements in the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century (MAP-
21) Act of 2012 and the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST)
Act of 2015.
Concurrent with this decades-long effort, the ACE Program has
annually sought to secure Department of Transportation (DOT)
discretionary grant funding for our grade separation projects without
any success, including multiple applications for BUILD (Better
Utilizing Investments to Leverage Development--formerly known as TIGER)
and INFRA (Infrastructure for Rebuilding America--formerly known as
FASTLANE) grants. I believe there are a number of reasons for our lack
of success, including the substantial cost of real estate in urban
areas which adds significant additional cost and adversely affects the
benefit-cost ratios for our projects.
This lack of success in securing Federal discretionary funding over
the last decade has been frustrating, especially given that our Program
has long been considered a top Federal priority. Consequently, we have
had to disproportionately rely on state and local funding to support
our construction projects that address Federal, state and regional
transportation priorities.
In the context of reauthorization and other transportation
infrastructure-related legislation, we respectfully request that the
Subcommittee consider the following policy recommendations that would
increase the availability of much needed funding for freight and grade
separation and crossing safety projects.
Support the enactment of robustly funded transportation infrastructure
legislation
I am excited that both the Majority and Minority Members of the
full Committee have recently recommended transportation and other
infrastructure principles. This is an important first step toward the
enactment of a robustly funded transportation authorization bill that
will seek to address our Nation's substantial transportation
infrastructure needs. It is my hope that any such legislation will
prioritize safety improvements, nationally and regionally significant
highway and multi-modal projects, and freight infrastructure. The
Majority's infrastructure framework in our view importantly prioritizes
funding freight projects of national and regional significance with
focused eligibility criteria to guide final discretion over project
selection and seeks to ensure that freight projects across all modes
are eligible for Federal investment.
Provide $12 billion a year for a discretionary freight grant program
and prioritize safety
We stand with the more than 60 agencies and organizations across
the nation who are members of the Coalition for America's Gateways and
Trade Corridors in advocating for $12 billion annually in Federal
funding to be provided to all modes of freight projects via a merit-
based discretionary grant program. Our experience has shown that the
Infrastructure for Rebuilding America or INFRA program authorized in
the FAST Act has tremendous potential to help build a strong national
multimodal freight network, but the $800 million to $900 million in
annual funding made available is inadequate. In fact, DOT reports
receiving $12 in unique requests nationwide for every $1 available made
available through the INFRA program.
We also recommend Congress require greater transparency for the
project discretionary selection process and provide additional
direction and guidance for this process. For instance, Congress should
direct that project evaluation through the discretionary grant process
prioritize safety as an outcome. Members of this panel with crossings
in their districts know well the devastating human toll that results
from crossing collisions. Yet, in benefit-cost analyses we have
prepared for grade separation projects submitted for Federal grant
funding, the quantification of reduced deaths and injuries yield
relatively minor benefits when compared to project costs, especially in
built-out urban areas with high real estate costs. Congress should
direct that projects that enhance safety are made commensurate to, or
at least competitive with, projects that improve efficiency, capacity
or throughput.
Create a discretionary grant program for rail-roadway crossing
improvements
The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and FRA are the primary
Federal agencies responsible for grade crossing safety across the
country, with FHWA administering the Section 130 formula program and
FRA providing safety oversight of both freight and passenger rail. We
applaud Congress for continuously authorizing the Section 130 program
for almost three decades. It is the primary program intended to provide
Federal assistance to localities seeking to implement at-grade
improvements to reduce the number, severity and potential of hazards to
motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians at crossings. The Section 130
program is authorized at between $200 million and $350 million annually
with these funds apportioned to the States by formula.
In California, the Section 130 program is administered by the
California Public Utility Commission, which regulates rail crossings,
and the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). We are
currently working with both state agencies to secure an award of
Section 130 funds for a project to install railroad right-of-way
fencing and pedestrian crossing gates in the City of Pomona, where
upwards of 80 freight trains a day traveling on multiple main line
tracks have resulted in alarming rates of pedestrian deaths and
injuries. Approximately $1 million to $3 million will be made available
in Section 130 funds for our project which has a total cost of $24
million, or a Federal contribution of less than 13 percent.
It is clear to us that the Section 130 funds made available to
California are insufficient, a situation likely experienced by other
states with ambitious crossing safety programs, while we are informed
that some states may not make full use of their annual allotments.
Congress should consider establishing a new, nationally competitive
discretionary grant program that is dedicated to providing funding to
the most nationally and regionally significant rail-roadway improvement
projects in the Nation. Unused annual Section 130 state allotments
could supplement this program or could be used directed to a separate
``pool'' for distribution to meritorious projects through a nationally
competitive process.
Bolster the CRISI program and better define applicant eligibility
We applaud Congress for authorizing the Consolidated Rail
Infrastructure and Safety Improvements (CRISI) program funded at about
$240 million per year to improve the safety, efficiency, and
reliability of passenger and freight rail. We support the Majority
proposal to direct $55 billion over five years toward freight and
passenger rail infrastructure, and respectfully recommend that a
significant portion be dedicated to grade separations. With grade
separations in urban areas in our experience costing an estimated $100
million each, additional CRISI funding is warranted.
In addition, we contend the definition of eligible applicants in
the CRISI authorizing statute is problematic and respectfully request
that it be amended. The statute defines eligible applicants as
``political subdivisions of a State,'' a term not clearly defined in
Federal law and a category without clearly enumerated eligible
entities. As an example of the negative impact of this lack of clarity,
consider that when ACE Construction Authority applied for funds from
the similarly structured Rail Line Relocation and Improvement Capital
Grant Program, FRA legal counsel opined that we were ineligible to
apply. This was despite the fact that ACE Construction Authority was a
California joint powers authority comprised of 30 cities and Los
Angeles County, and had been delegated all powers, such as eminent
domain and others, necessary to implement a $1.8 billion grade crossing
safety program. FRA counsel said that ACE Construction Authority lacked
two attributes common to a political subdivision of a State: first, a
police force and, second, taxing authority. However, neither attribute
is necessary to implement a program of crossing improvements, as we
have been doing for nearly 20 years. We urge Congress to expand the
definition of eligible applicants in this program, preferably modeled
after the more expansive definition used in the statute authorizing the
INFRA program.
Consider effects of railroad contribution to grade separation projects
As you know, Federal law limits the railroad contribution to a
grade separation project to no more than 5 percent of cost, with a
further restriction that the contribution level be based on a project's
theoretical, as opposed to actual, cost. Railroad contributions have
averaged about $3 million per each ACE Trade Corridor grade separation,
which typically cost more than $100 million.
Congresswoman Grace Napolitano represents the San Gabriel Valley
and has long been a leading champion of the ACE Program in Congress.
She has strenuously urged the railroads to increase their grade
separation contribution to be commensurate to the benefits realized.
Although we truly appreciate Congresswoman Napolitano's advocacy, we
have not taken a position on this matter, and instead have focused on
ensuring our working relationship with Union Pacific Railroad remains
cooperative and cost-effective in implementing the ACE Program. If
Congress decides to revisit the issue of the railroad contribution, we
do offer the observation that the Federal contribution limit creates a
disincentive to use minor Federal funding on a grade separation in a
state like California where the railroad contribution is set at 10
percent if the project is solely funded from state or local sources. We
have, in fact, deprogrammed Federal funds from two of our grade
separation projects that are currently under construction because the
presence of those funds would have had the effect of halving the
railroad contribution.
In closing, I thank the Chairman and Members of the panel for this
opportunity to offer testimony regarding the ACE Program and our
recommendations for improvements to Federal funding programs. I would
like to express my appreciation to Congresswoman Grace Napolitano for
her advocacy for the ACE Program for more than two decades. She is a
strong champion of improving grade crossing safety on behalf of our
communities and I thank her for her service.

Mr. Lipinski. Thank you.
I now recognize Ms. Maleh for 5 minutes.
Ms. Maleh. Chairman Lipinski, Ranking Member Crawford, and
members of the subcommittee----
Mr. Lipinski. Can you pull the microphone closer?
Ms. Maleh. Thank you for inviting me to testify about
Operation Lifesaver, Inc.'s ongoing work to save lives at grade
crossings and along rights-of-way. My name is Rachel Maleh, and
I have been executive director since November of 2018.
Operation Lifesaver started in 1972 in Idaho and quickly
expanded to other States around the U.S. The national office
was established in 1986. OLI is the only nationally recognized
nonprofit leader of rail safety education.
Our mission is to save lives by empowering the public to
make safer choices near tracks and trains. We do this through a
network of active programs across the country in each State and
through public education and awareness campaigns.
Our safety partners include Federal, State, and local
government agencies, highway safety education, America's
railroads, and railway suppliers. Together we promote the three
E's--education, engineering, and enforcement.
OLI's funding comes from Federal partners, private sector
contributors, including Class I railroads and railway suppliers
and foundation grants. About 64 percent of our funding is from
Federal resources. Private partners account for 31 percent, and
foundation grants contribute 5 percent.
The heart of OLI is its grassroots network of State program
directors and volunteers in 45 States and the District of
Columbia. Our volunteers are out in their communities every
day. We educate people about how to safely navigate grade
crossings and to never use train tracks as a shortcut pathway.
Our 2018 annual report shows that 1.6 million people were
reached directly across the United States in over 20,000
Operation Lifesaver presentations, training classes, and
events. All of these efforts are free of charge and given in
the interest of safety.
Our primary Federal partners are the Federal Railroad
Administration, the Federal Highway Administration, and the
Federal Transit Administration. One of the most visible results
of our Federal partnerships are the competitive rail safety
grants that OLI awards to State Operation Lifesaver programs,
commuter railroads, and rail transit agencies.
In 2019, OLI used FRA funding to award rail safety grants
through a competitive process to 13 State programs, including
States that rank among the top 15 for grade crossing and
trespass incidents. Last year, OLI used FTA funding to award
competitive rail transit safety grants to 10 agencies in 8
States. This Federal funding truly is making a difference in
communities across the Nation.
Funding from the Posner Foundation of Pittsburgh allowed us
to extend the reach of these federally funded projects. While
we are making great strides in reducing crossing collisions,
which have fallen by 82 percent since 1972, it is still a
startling fact that every 3 hours in the U.S. a person or a
vehicle is hit by a train. That is why rail safety education is
so important still today.
One example of how OLI's awareness is making a difference
is through our Rail Safety Week held each year, the last week
in September. This year, Rail Safety Week will take place
Monday, September 21, through Sunday, September 27, in the
U.S., Canada, and Mexico, making it truly a North American
effort.
OLI's efforts act as a force multiplier, leveraging Federal
funds for greater impact. Since 2017, we have awarded a total
of 29 Federal FRA competitive State grant funds for more than
$400,000, with the return of more than $1.4 million to States
and communities.
In the Chicago area, OLI is partnering with FRA on a
trespass prevention education project to see how our Near
Miss--Headphones PSA affects the behavior of the young male
demographic. Illinois Operation Lifesaver also works closely
with Metra commuter rail on education outreach.
Our Find the Blue and White Emergency Notification System
Sign PSA campaign shows drivers what to do if they get stuck on
tracks. This PSA is being distributed nationally through a
digital and broadcast campaign.
Each time a potentially catastrophic incident at a crossing
is prevented, lives are saved, injuries are avoided, and
communities are safer. This is our impact. If Operation
Lifesaver were fortunate enough to receive additional funds
from Federal sources, we could expand the successful Federal-
State grants and develop additional programs and resources for
our State programs.
On behalf of Operation Lifesaver, I am grateful to our
Federal, State, and local government safety partners, as well
as our private contributors for their continued support. We
hope you will learn more about Operation Lifesaver and join us
in our safety efforts by visiting us at OLI.org.
Thank you very much.

Prepared Statement of Rachel Maleh, Executive Director, Operation
Lifesaver, Inc.
Introduction
Chairman Lipinski, Ranking Member Crawford, and Members of the
Subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to testify in today's hearing
to talk about Operation Lifesaver, Inc.'s ongoing work to save lives at
grade crossings and along rights of way.
My name is Rachel Maleh, and I have been Executive Director of this
organization since November of 2018. With a background in nonprofit
management and a passion for working with mission-driven organizations,
I am energized and excited to see this organization grow and succeed.
OLI is the only nationally recognized nonprofit leader of rail
safety education. Our mission is to save lives by empowering the public
to make safer choices near tracks and trains. We do this through a
network of active state programs across the country and through public
education and awareness campaigns. These rail safety awareness
campaigns use innovative marketing and digital communications to
educate people about staying safe near tracks and trains. The state
programs are partners of the national Operation Lifesaver organization.
Our safety partners include federal, state and local government
agencies, highway safety organizations, America's railroads and railway
suppliers. Together, we promote the three E's--Education, Enforcement
and Engineering--to keep people safe around tracks and railway
crossings across the country.
The heart of Operation Lifesaver is its grassroots network of state
program directors and volunteers in 45 states and the District of
Columbia. Our volunteers are out in their communities every day
spreading our lifesaving messages with safety presentations tailored
for a range of audiences. We speak to law enforcement and first
responders, community groups, local businesses, K-12 students and
college students, new drivers, professional truck drivers and school
bus drivers. We educate people about how to safely navigate grade
crossings, and to never use train tracks as a short cut or pathway.
All these outreach efforts are free of charge and given in the
interest of safety. Our passionate volunteers are one of Operation
Lifesaver's greatest strengths. Our volunteers are community leaders,
active and retired train crew members, law enforcement officers and
trucking industry representatives, as well as people who have been
personally touched by track tragedies who want to help keep people safe
in their communities.
History
Operation Lifesaver got its start in 1972 in Idaho as a six-week
public awareness educational campaign to promote highway-rail grade
crossing safety. At the time, there were approximately 12,000 annual
vehicle-train crossing collisions in the United States. The program was
a success and quickly expanded to other states. Within a decade there
were state OL programs around the U.S. The National Office of Operation
Lifesaver, Inc. was established in 1986.
By 2018, the number of crossing collisions had dropped by 82
percent to approximately 2,200. This significant improvement is the
result of a concerted safety partnership among states, the federal
government, law enforcement agencies and railroads that included
crossing closures, federal funding for grade crossing engineering
improvements and enforcement of crossing safety laws. Operation
Lifesaver's consistent education efforts also have contributed to these
safety gains.
The chart below shows trends in railroad grade trespass incidents,
grade crossing incidents, and suicide-related trespass incidents from
FRA.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

The effectiveness of the U.S. Operation Lifesaver program has
spurred other efforts in North America and across the globe. Canada
adopted the Operation Lifesaver program in 1980, and Estonia followed
in 2004. In 2014, the Association of Mexican Railroads signed a
cooperative agreement with OLI to work together on rail safety issues.
South Africa's Rail Safety Regulator also signed a cooperative
agreement with OLI in 2017.
Operation Lifesaver Efforts and Partners
The National Office of Operation Lifesaver, Inc., with four full
time positions including mine, works with the state programs and
develop materials and programs with a consistent message to distribute
to the states. Across the U.S., Operation Lifesaver has 1,024 active
volunteers, and we are adding several hundred trained volunteers each
year.
Operation Lifesaver has been able to sustain our educational
outreach efforts at the state and national levels thanks to the support
of a wide variety of partners. We work closely with public and private
organizations at the federal, state, and local level.
OLI's funding comes from federal partners, private sector
contributors, including Class I railroads and railway suppliers, and
foundation grants. About 64% of our funding is from federal resources,
private partners account for 31%, and foundation grants contribute 5%.
Our primary federal partners are the Federal Railroad
Administration (FRA), Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and
Federal Transit Administration (FTA). FRA has supported Operation
Lifesaver since 1988. Our FRA grants are funded on an annual basis. We
also recently entered into a new five-year cooperative agreement with
FHWA. These federal partnerships are critically important for OLI's
ongoing rail safety education efforts.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ See Appendix 1, pages 9-10 [page nos. correspond to the
statement in its original format and not as it appears here--Ed.]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
One of the most visible results of our partnerships with FRA, FHWA
and FTA are the competitive rail safety grants that OLI awards to state
Operation Lifesaver programs, commuter railroads and rail transit
agencies around the U.S. For example, in 2019 OLI used FRA funding to
award rail safety grants to 13 state programs through a competitive
process. Included were states that rank among the top 15 for grade
crossing and trespass incidents. OLI last year also used FTA funding to
award competitive rail transit safety grants to 10 transit agencies in
eight states. This federal funding truly is making a difference in
communities across the nation.
Private Foundation Grants Extend the Reach of Federal Grants
Our private grant funding from the Posner Foundation of Pittsburgh
allows us to extend the reach of these federally funded projects. OLI
received its first private grant funding in late 2018 from the Posner
Foundation of Pittsburgh for projects in 2019 and again this year.
The Posner Grant enabled OLI in 2019 to award rail safety awareness
campaign funding to five states who had submitted applications for the
FRA competitive state rail safety grants, bringing the total number of
states receiving grants to 18.
Public Awareness Safety Campaigns
Operation Lifesaver, Inc. for decades has worked to create and
distribute rail safety awareness campaigns with the help of our safety
partners. For example, in 2014 we launched the ``See Tracks? Think
Train!'' campaign, partnering with the Association of American
Railroads to develop and distribute public service announcements
(PSAs), graphics and safety tips to communities nationwide. The
campaign continues through our state programs, as well as on the
seetracksthinktrain.org microsite, where drivers and pedestrians can
view the PSAs and download safety tips and graphics to help share
lifesaving information. Our federal partners also helped with that
campaign and continue to assist us with developing new information and
materials that will resonate with today's busy, distracted public.
As I mentioned, one of the most effective and longstanding
partnerships for Operation Lifesaver is our relationship with the
Federal Railroad Administration. For years, FRA grant funding has been
used to offer competitive state rail safety grants to state programs
that allow those programs a broader reach with lifesaving messages.
Examples of 2019 State OL Safety Efforts, Partnerships and FRA Grant
Projects

Missouri Operation Lifesaver was awarded a competitive
FRA grant for a targeted rail safety campaign that included: Radio and
Video PSA distribution statewide, Digital Media ads during Rail Safety
Week, a poster contest promoted through the Missouri State High School
Activities Association and fall sporting events, plus Officer on the
Train Events during Rail Safety Week. In the wake of these efforts,
preliminary Missouri numbers for crossing crashes for 2019 appear to be
down 23% compared to 2018.\\ Fatalities are also down 62% at three and
injuries are also down 7% at 13 in 2019 compared to the same time
period in 2018.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

\2\ See Appendix 2, pages 10-11
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oregon Operation Lifesaver boosted social media posts
during key months to reach people where an increase in incidents
occurred, reaching 73,979 people through social media. Oregon Lifesaver
worked with Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) Rail and placed
Geo-Fencing digital ads around Portland in summer months, in areas
where ODOT saw an increase in trespassing and crossing incidents. The
ad reached 167,717 people in one month. Also, in 2018 Oregon
participated in the new Crossing Action Plan with ODOT, building a
partnership for funding and awareness in the state.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ See Appendix 3, pages 11-12
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

South Carolina Operation Lifesaver partnered with the
South Carolina Transport Police to educate professional truck drivers
about the ENS sign using the ``Find the Blue and White to Save Your
Life'' PSA in social media posts, presentations and materials. High
school students were also targeted. In addition, through an FRA Grant
received to promote ``Find the Blue and White to Save your Life,''
truck drivers were targeted with Geo-Fencing digital and radio PSAs,
yielding millions of impressions and reaching hundreds of thousands.\4\

2019 FTA Competitive Grants Project Examples \5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County's
(METRO) project provided education to the Houston community about rail
transit safety by distributing approved OLI materials, displaying
transit safety messages on portable billboards and promoting rail
safety education on social media.

Caltrain conducted a safety awareness campaign, ``You Are
Not Faster Than A Train,'' with a short rail safety video featuring
MythBusters' Kari Byron, direct outreach, social media campaigns,
brochures, and a podcast.

Metrolink's awareness campaign included geo fencing
display advertising and English and Spanish radio commercials targeted
at males ages 18-39 in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino
and Ventura counties.
Why Operation Lifesaver is still needed
While the number of highway-rail crossing collisions, deaths and
injuries has dropped considerably over the past five decades, it's
still a startling fact that about every three hours in the U.S., a
person or vehicle is hit by a train.
Clearly, too many people don't believe they must ``always expect a
train.'' Too many drivers fail to understand that a train cannot stop
quickly; they don't know that an average freight train takes a mile and
a half to come to a stop.
It's for these reasons, and more, that Operation Lifesaver's rail
safety education mission is still important today, as we start our 48th
year of existence. The information below indicates the extent of the
issue.

Today, more than 50 percent of vehicle/train crashes
occur at public grade crossings that are equipped with active warning
devices.

Impatient drivers, perhaps distracted by mobile devices
and smartphones, too often think they can beat a train at a crossing.

A motorist is almost 20 times more likely to die in a
crash involving a train than in a collision with another motor vehicle.

The impact of a train striking a car or truck is
comparable to a soda can being run over by a car.

Another challenge is the increase in trespass fatalities--people
who either don't realize it's illegal and dangerous to walk on railroad
tracks or are intentionally putting themselves in harm's way. Some of
our recent projects, funded by our federal partners and new private
grants, are targeted to the trespass problem.
What's Working
One example of how Operation Lifesaver's public awareness efforts
are making a difference is Rail Safety Week (RSW), OLI's largest
communications and marketing effort each year. RSW is a week-long
focused campaign stressing the importance of rail safety with the
general public. OLI has used funding from our federal partners to help
us develop Rail Safety Week materials and messaging for public
education; in addition, we encourage state programs applying for
competitive safety grants to concentrate their campaigns during Rail
Safety Week for greater total impact.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

The 2019 observance was the third annual U.S. event and second
joint observance with Operation Lifesaver Canada. ``Operation Clear
Track,'' an enforcement effort held on the Tuesday of RSW, was led by
Amtrak.
This year, Rail Safety Week will take place Monday, September 21
through Sunday, September 27. For the first time, Mexico will join in
the observance of Rail Safety Week this year, making it truly a North
American effort.
Another part of Rail Safety Week is our ``Stop Track Tragedies''
video campaign, which highlights the stories of real people whose lives
have been forever changed by trespass and crossing incidents. These
human stories resonate more than reams of data.
Last year, the Stop Track Tragedies videos included the story of
Ashley Igo. In 1999, Ashley, then just a child, survived a semi-truck
and train collision at a crossing in Bourbonnais, Illinois. Ashley's
mother, another relative, and two friends were among those killed in
that horrific crash, which killed several others and caused injuries to
many more passengers. Ashley survived but lost part of her leg and now
wears a prosthesis. We were so grateful to Ashley for being a part of
our campaign, and for speaking out about the importance of safe driving
at every grade crossing.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

We've seen great results from Rail Safety Week efforts across the
U.S.\6\ Preliminary 2019 Rail Safety Week results show the impact of
Rail Safety Week continues to grow, with increases in the number of
local broadcast news stories, social media engagement, and pageviews of
the OLI website. In 2019, participation in Operation Clear Track from
law enforcement agencies and others rose, with events at more than
1,600 locations in 47 states nationwide. During Operation Clear Track,
safety partners distribute safety tips cards to motorists and
pedestrians. The Operation Clear Track enforcement efforts drive much
of the news coverage during Rail Safety Week.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Innovative Safety Education Programs
Our national office develops innovative safety education programs
that are specifically geared for the audiences for whom a crossing
collision poses the greatest risk. We work with subject matter experts
to produce accurate, engaging products that can save lives.
Our eLearning programs--offering free online, interactive
programs--for Professional Drivers, School Bus Drivers, and First
Responders prepare these drivers for situations they may encounter near
railroad tracks and crossings. Thousands of drivers have been exposed
to these eLearning programs since they started a few years ago.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

For law enforcement personnel, OLI has a special Grade Crossing
Collision Investigation (GCCI) course that teaches law enforcement
officers how to ensure their personal safety, both while responding to
rail collision incidents and throughout their investigation of rail-
related collisions and incidents. A completely revamped version of this
course, now expanded for all first responders and renamed Railroad
Investigation and Safety Course, or RISC, is being rolled out this
year. We have started training the facilitators who will be involved in
presenting this in-person program across the U.S.
A Force Multiplier
We recently did an ROI analysis for Operation Lifesaver's Federal
Railroad Administration grant funding. Here's what we found. Since
2017, OLI awarded a total of 29 FRA Competitive State Grants for a
total of approximately $406,000. Those grant projects had overall
return of morethan $1.4 million to the states and communities, in terms
of campaign value and other metrics.
The federal investment in Operation Lifesaver, Inc. yields benefits
from more than just our state competitive grant programs--our PSA
campaigns, website, and social media activity further extend the reach
for our lifesaving messages. This federal partnership is a key
component of OLI's project activity.
In the Chicago area, OLI is partnering with the FRA on a trespass
prevention education project in Cook County to see how a targeted
campaign with our ``Near Miss--Headphones'' PSA affects the behavior of
a young male demographic.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Our ``Find the Blue and White'' Emergency Notification Sign PSA
campaign has been available nationally for over a year, with a
broadcast, cable and social media placement campaign. The six-month
broadcast and cable results alone for the ENS PSA include more than
13,600 airings confirmed by Nielsen Media Research, with a total
audience of more than 156 million gross impressions, and estimated ad
equivalency topping $3.5 million.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

In 2019, with funds from our federal safety partners, OLI revamped
the oli.org website to be completely mobile-friendly, conform to web
design best practices and improve navigation. The new site launched in
November 2019. The oli.org website had more than 600,000 visitors last
year. New visitors to the site also rose in 2019; mobile users of the
site were up more than 18% from 2018, showing the ROI of the mobile-
friendly redesign.
In social media, total followers for OLI's social channels
(Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest and Twitter) continues to grow. We're
nearing 42,000 total followers across those accounts, with total social
media impressions up 55 percent between 2018 and 2019, to 23.5 million.
Our 2018 annual report \7\ is just out, and it shows that 1.6
million people were reached directly across the U.S. in over 20,000
Operation Lifesaver presentations, training classes and events.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\7\ See Appendix 7, page 13 [page no. corresponds to the statement
in its original format and not as it appears here--Ed.]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are intangible benefits from Operation Lifesaver's efforts
across the U.S., as well. Collisions between trains and vehicles often
result in loss of life or catastrophic injury. These incidents can tie
up crossings for hours, wreaking havoc on traffic in communities and
impeding the flow of commerce. Each time a potentially catastrophic
incident at a crossing is prevented, lives are saved, injuries are
avoided, and communities are safer--this is Operation Lifesaver's
impact. Also, these national results do not include the trickle-down
ROI that occurs at the state and local level thanks to our active and
successful state programs.
Additional Opportunities
If Operation Lifesaver were to be fortunate enough to receive
additional funds from federal sources, we would have the opportunity to
do more of our grassroots work. Our first use of additional funding
would be to expand the successful state grant programs. For example, in
2019 we received 26 applications for FRA competitive state grants. The
funding only allowed us to approve 13 applications. Private Posner
Foundation of Pittsburgh funding provided an additional five, allowing
us to fund 18 out of 26 applications. We would welcome additional
federal grant funds to fund crossing safety and trespass prevention
campaigns and efforts in more states.
It's important to note that these competitive grant programs
leverage local rail safety education funding with federal grant
funding. Operation Lifesaver competitive grant programs from FHWA, FRA
and FTA all require a local dollar match in order to receive federal
funds for safety activities and campaigns, underscoring the shared
responsibility for safety efforts in communities. Our state programs
are managed by dedicated individuals who know best the rail safety
education needs of their states/communities and how best to engage
their local stakeholders to receive match dollars and in-kind services
that amplify the federal investment.
Other increased federal funds would be put to good use developing
additional tools and resources to distribute to our state programs so
that they can make an even bigger impact in their communities. For
example, this year we are using federal grant funds to update OLI's
most-used safety brochures with key safety tips for drivers,
pedestrians, first responders, and others. These materials are
distributed across the U.S. at state and local events. It has been
almost ten years since we had the funding to update these vital
resources, which will also be available on our website. In addition, as
we work to tackle the more difficult problem of pedestrian trespassing,
additional resources would help us reach more people in vulnerable
demographics.
Conclusion
Operation Lifesaver will celebrate 50 years of saving lives in
2022. On behalf of Operation Lifesaver, I thank our federal, state and
local government safety partners, as well as our private contributors,
for your continued support. This small nonprofit has yielded big gains
in reducing crossing incidents, deaths and injuries. Strong support for
our rail safety efforts here also encourages international partnerships
and the sharing of best practices.
The organization's future is solid, and new opportunities are ahead
for expanding partnerships with both the national office and our state
programs. Every day, Operation Lifesaver is saving lives by spreading
our safety message. The more individuals and organizations become part
of our efforts, the stronger and more effective our message becomes. If
you are already part of the OLI family, thank you! If not, we hope you
will learn more, and join our safety effort, at oli.org.

Appendix 2: Missouri Operation Lifesaver Success Story
Tim Hull, Executive Director, MO OL
Preliminary end of the year numbers for crossing crashes in
Missouri for 2019 appear to be down 23% compared to 2018. Fatalities
are also down 62% at three and injuries are also down 7% at 13 in 2019
compared to the same time period in 2018.
In 2018 Missouri experienced 8 fatalities at public rail crossings,
which was a 62% increase for the year compared to 2017.
Missouri Pedestrian/trespass incidents appear to be following the
nationwide trend, as our current numbers indicate an increase compared
to the same time period in 2018. Missouri experienced 17 trespass
incidents resulting in 12 fatalities and four injuries. Missouri
trespass incidents are up one or 5%, and trespass fatalities are
currently up slightly by 25% or an increase of three for 2019. (A
couple of the trespass incidents are still under investigation and
there is a good possibility that they will be reclassified at a suicide
in one case and a homicide in the other as the individual in the last
case died of gunshot wounds and was not struck by a train.) So, we may
be even with 2018 numbers if those are changed.
What helped drive the success?
We conducted 5 Officer on the Train (OOT) events around the state,
resulting in 120 traffic violations focusing primarily in and near our
targets counties. These OOTs are performed with law enforcement
officers in the engine of the train and multiple officers on the ground
to chase violators. Media releases were issued primarily through the MO
State Highway Patrol or railroads for these OOT events. Radio, TV and
newspaper interviews were conducted during most of these events. (Four
of the OOT operations were held during National Rail Safety Week Sept.
22-28, 2019). Seven Grade Crossing Collision Investigation Classes
(GCCI) were given to 140 law enforcement officers primarily in our
target counties. An additional 22 Positive Enforcement Programs, PEPs,
were conducted at various rail crossing locations around the state
primarily in those target counties in which a total of 5,667, people
were contacted with a safety message and in some cases a brochure. (6
of those PEPs were conducted during National Rail Safety Week.)
Missouri Operation Lifesaver conducted a statewide radio ad and
social media program for the months of July through September 2019. The
cost of the project was $45,000.00. Funding was as follows:

OLI/FRA--$20,000.00 (Competitive State Grant)

Hwy Safety Grant--$10,000.00 (State match)

Learfield Communication--$15,000.00 (Donated/in kind
airtime)

The Campaign began July 15 and ran through Missouri Rail Safety
Week September 22-28, 2019 to the end of September and Missouri Farm
Safety Month. It included social media ads on Facebook and Instagram,
and radio PSAs.
Results of Targeting Counties--Decline in the Target County Number of
Crashes, As Well As Statewide Incidents.
Eight counties were targeted in 2019 using crash data from 2017-
2018 and unsafe motorists reports from UP and BNSF Railroads. A total
of 20 crashes with five fatalities and seven injuries occurred in those
8 target counties during the years 2017 and 2018. In those specific
counties the preliminary numbers for crash data in 2019 are 15 crashes,
three fatalities and five injuries. We have experienced a substantial
decrease to date in crossing collisions statewide compared to the same
time period as last year, and trespassing incidents thus far appear to
be slightly higher compared to that same time period, encouraging us to
conduct even more of these enforcement events in 2020 and continue to
target our highest incident locations.
And let's not forget our OLAVs who worked very hard in getting our
safety message out. The number of OL presentations was also up in 2019
compared to 2018 as follows:
In 2018 Missouri OLAVs reported 485 presentations to 10,868
attendees.
In 2019 Missouri OLAVs reported 643 presentations to 9,397
attendees.
Appendix 3: Oregon Operation Lifesaver Success Story
Steven Kreins, Executive Director, OR OL
2019 was a very busy year for Oregon Operation Lifesaver. We
exceeded all our 2019 goals. As of December 26, 2019, there has been
209 presentations and 31 special events in our state reaching 24,735
people. We still have a few events to report by the end of the calendar
year and hope to reach a little over 25,000 people for the year. This
is an increase from 18,779 people in 2018, which means we exceeded our
10% increase for 2019. Currently we sit around 2,400 volunteer hours in
2019 that helped us exceed our goal in Oregon. We continue to recruit
new and active volunteers in our state and added 4 new volunteers to
our program in 2019.
Oregon is lucky to have Special Agent in charge Vince Hoffarth, who
teaches at the Oregon State Police Academy to all new cadets. Vince
Hoffarth who also holds a board position for Oregon Operation Lifesaver
has instructed 6 classes this year to new cadets reaching 240 new
police officers in our state. This is big for Oregon as we try and push
more enforcement from agencies going forward.
In 2019 Oregon increased its social media platform by adding
Twitter and continuing Facebook. Our Facebook has 959 followers with
25% of that being women and 75% being men. Most of our followers are
between 35-65 years old. Oregon added Twitter to our profile in 2018
with a following of 1,098 followers. Oregon will continue to push our
social media platforms in 2020 to reach all age groups. Oregon
Lifesaver boosted ads this year during key months to reach people where
we were seeing an increase in incidents. Oregon boosted multiple ads
costing around the 500-dollar mark reaching 73,979 people through
social media.
Oregon Lifesaver worked with ODOT Rail and a group that does Geo
Fencing to place a Geo Fence ad around Portland. This ad stretched as
far as Woodburn and east of Troutdale. The ad was placed in the summer
where ODOT saw an increase in trespassing and crossing incidents. The
ad cost 2,000.00 dollars for one month and we reached 167,717 people.
In 2018 we participated in the new Crossing Action Plan with ODOT.
We built a partnership in 2019 to receive funding and help increase
awareness around Oregon with advertisement and PSA ads. We hope to
continue our efforts in 2020. Area coordinators, volunteers and state
partners continued to identify locations throughout the state that
would be effective in new partnerships and furthering the mission of
Oregon Operation Lifesaver.
Oregon Lifesaver has started to work with ODOT and Western
University to help push out more information in the new Drivers-Ed
manual scheduled to come out in 2020. We will continue to work with
this group going forward as over 13,000 students go through Drivers-Ed
every year. Oregon made every effort in 2019 to increase our driver
education efforts by increasing our presentations and people reached.
Currently we have participated in 21 driver education presentations
reaching 3,609 people in 2019. We hope to see an increase in this field
with our new partnership with Western University and the Drivers-Ed
program.
Enforcement efforts have been a big part of our mission in 2019 and
will continue in 2020. Union Pacific participated in 6 ``Officer-On-A-
Train'' enforcement events. Multiple city agencies have participated in
these events as well as rail safety week. Oregon Operation Lifesaver
sent out three letters to photographers and two schools who posted
photos on the tracks in Oregon. We have also been in contact with one
PUD electric company and a newspaper who held a photo contest in our
state where railroad trespassing photos won a prize. We will continue
in 2020 to send more letters to media and groups who participate in
this type of behavior.

We partnered with the South Carolina Transport Police to educate
professional truck drivers about the ENS sign using the ``Find the Blue
and White to Save Your Life'' PSA in social media posts, presentations
and support postcards and posters. See the steps below that our STP
took to spread this message to companies with commercial motor vehicle
fleets reaching thousands of truck drivers in multiple ways.
Truck Driver Outreach Results:

Six Regional Sergeants within SC State Transport Police
(STP) were identified and assigned the duty of distribution of ``Find
the Blue and White to Save Your Life'' Presentations, Posters,
Postcards, Key Chains and PSAs to 33 companies with commercial motor
vehicle fleets

STP distributed materials to 20 companies at Michelin
Fleet Safety Solutions Conference asking companies to pledge to
railroad safety in Spartanburg

7 Crossings and Scale Houses highly used by truck drivers
were targeted for material distribution by STP staff

7 Gas Stations and Trucks stops highly used by truck
drivers were targeted for material distribution by STP staff

STP DRIVE to Zero team distributed information, cards and
key chains to students and faculty at Westwood, Greenwood, and
Lexington High Schools

STP Twitter disseminated the ``Find the Blue and White''
PSA and related information as well as sharing Rail Safety Week Daily

https://yearly.report/from/#/oli/2018-annual-report

Mr. Lipinski. Thank you, Ms. Maleh.
I now recognize Mr. O'Shea for 5 minutes.
Mr. O'Shea. Thank you, Chairman Lipinski and ranking
members of the subcommittee. My name is Matthew O'Shea, and I
serve as alderman of Chicago's 19th Ward.
Blocked at-grade rail crossings represent a serious threat
to the safety of my community and congressional action is
needed. The 19th Ward includes 10 at-grade rail crossings along
the Elsdon and Blue Island Lines. It is not uncommon for any of
these crossings to be blocked for extended periods of time.
While historically we have lived with the inconvenience,
our problems were amplified exponentially in 2013 when CSX
Railroad acquired the Elsdon Line. Since then, blocked
crossings have become commonplace, at times lasting for hours.
In 2013, when the Surface Transportation Board granted CSX
the authority to operate on the Elsdon Line, they contemplated
the impact of blocked at-grade crossings on our neighborhood.
In response, CSX agreed to conditions that required them to cut
any train that blocks any crossing for longer than 10 minutes.
In 2015, we petitioned the STB to enforce these conditions
and provided them with several hundred unique letters from
residents regarding blocked crossings. I will share with you
some of those highlights: multiple reports of children climbing
through stopped trains; disruption to personal lives, including
late arrivals at school or daycare; missed medical appointments
or flights; lost wages as a result of blocked crossings.
We even heard from a pair of newlyweds who missed the first
hour of their own wedding reception after being stopped by a
train. A resident who missed saying her final goodbyes to her
grandfather because a stopped train prevented her from getting
to Little Company of Mary Hospital. She arrived 15 minutes too
late.
But most disturbing are the comments from first responders
who could not properly address an emergency or secure adequate
backup because of a blocked at-grade rail crossing. A
firefighter wrote, and I quote, ``Every minute a cardiac arrest
victim goes without CPR means a 10-percent decrease in survival
rate.''
A doctor at Advocate Christ Medical Center described times
she has been stuck by blocked crossings and noted that 15
minutes can determine the success or failure in saving a fetus
in distress.
Four years later, in 2019, now in 2020, a final decision
from the STB is still pending. But CSX has successfully argued
that it is operationally very difficult, if not impossible, to
cut a train in most circumstances. The STB agreed and released
them of that requirement.
Now think about that timeline for a second. In 2013, CSX
tells the STB that in exchange for the right to operate on the
Elsdon Line and substantially increase the volume of traffic in
the area, it will cut any train that is stopped for longer than
10 minutes. Now they don't actually cut the trains. And when
questioned, they argued that effectively doing so is
operationally extremely difficult, near impossible.
Is anyone else wondering why CSX offered to cut the trains
in the first place, or why they obligated themselves to cut
trains if doing so was so difficult? That original operating
order included several other provisions that have not yet been
stricken by the STB, the most important of which is to install
a closed-circuit video system at both Advocate Christ Medical
Center, so staff would know when a crossing was blocked and
could better coordinate with emergency vehicles.
Advocate Christ is the only level 1 trauma center that
serves the Southwest Side of Chicago. It is also the busiest
trauma center in the entire State of Illinois. Here we are in
2020, and yet no system has been installed. The lack of
accountability is troubling.
The conditions imposed by the STB in the original order
authorizing CSX to operate on the Elsdon Line show an
underlying belief that railroads must cause no harm to the
communities in which they operate. Who will step in and respond
when railroads aren't good neighbors? Why hasn't the STB levied
fines or revoked CSX's operating agreement?
Federal regulation is pervasive in the railroad industry,
but it is silent on the issue of at-grade crossings. That must
change. Without action by Congress, this situation, both in my
community and all across our country, will only get worse.
Local communities are not equipped to police these matters;
Congress is.
I traveled today from Chicago here to Washington, DC,
seeking your support. Help me address the problems on the
Elsdon Line by signing on to a letter asking the STB to mandate
a video system at Advocate Christ Medical Center.
Second, enact simple, commonsense regulations, requiring
all trains to clear at-grade crossings in 3 minutes or less,
and establishing a penalty system for any at-grade crossings
blocked for 10 minutes or more.
I appreciate your time. Thank you.
[Mr. O'Shea's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Matthew O'Shea, Alderman, 19th Ward of
Chicago, Chicago City Council
Thank you, Chairman Lipinski and members of the Subcommittee. I am
Matthew O'Shea, and I have had the honor to serve as the Alderman for
Chicago's 19th Ward since 2011. I'll be speaking today about the severe
impact that blocked at-grade crossings have had on my largely
residential community on Chicago's far southwest side.
The current federal framework to regulate railroad operations has
failed to protect our community from wide-ranging and potentially life-
threatening effects directly caused by the manner in which CSX operates
one line in particular, the Elsdon Line, which runs through densely
populated communities in the City of Chicago and surrounding
municipalities.
Railroads are entirely capable of mitigating the effects of their
operations on the communities where they operate, but will not do so
voluntarily--our experience is, unfortunately, ample proof of that.
Stronger measures are clearly necessary to ensure that railroads are
not a threat to their neighbors. Because of the broad reach of federal
law in the rail industry, only Congress can impose those necessary
measures. I will include some simple but potentially effective
proposals at the end of this statement.
I.  Description of 19th Ward
A.  Chicago's 19th Ward is comprised of the neighborhoods of
Beverly, Mount Greenwood, and Morgan Park.
B.  Our total population is over 50,000, a good-sized small city in
itself, and is \2/3\ white, a quarter African-American, five percent
Hispanic, and about one percent Asian-American. We are a tight-knit
community of predominantly single-family homes built in the early to
mid-20th Century, with local businesses along 95th Street, 103rd
Street, 111th Street, Western Avenue, Kedzie Avenue and Pulaski Road.
C.  Several rail lines run through or border our Ward, including
CSX's Blue Island Subdivision and the Elsdon Line, which run north-
south through our Ward. I will be speaking today about the impact of
the Elsdon Line, which runs through the heart of our community,
parallel to Sacramento Avenue.
II.  Impacts of CSX Operations 2013-2016
A.  CSX was authorized to operate on the Elsdon Line in 2012 when
it received approval from the Surface Transportation Board, or STB,
after an extensive public comment process. Because the STB recognized
that the communities surrounding the Elsdon Line are densely populated
and the line has many at-grade crossings, including five in the 19th
Ward, it imposed a number of conditions on the railroad to try to
reduce the impacts of its planned increased operations. These
conditions may have constituted a well-meaning attempt to reduce harm,
but the community saw an immediate, dramatic and harmful impact once
CSX started running on the Elsdon Line.
1.  Virtually all of my comments reflect material that is already
in the public record in the STB's docket, Finance Docket Number 35522.
2.  The line existed but had been little-used previously, and CSX
indicated that it expected traffic on the Elsdon Line to increase from
3-4 trains per day to over 20.
3.  CSX promised to abide by a number of conditions as part of
its operating approval, and noted that it expected to clear at-grade
crossings in three minutes or less.
4.  Here are some of the extremely detailed and specific
conditions CSX voluntarily accepted in order to have permission to
operate on the Elsdon Line. These conditions are listed in the STB's
February 8, 2013 Decision \1\ granting CSX permission to operate:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ CSX Transportation, Inc.--Acquisition of Operating Easement--
Grand Trunk Western R.R. Co., STB Docket No. 35522 (Service Date Feb.
8, 2013).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
a)  Cut any train that blocked an at-grade crossing for more
than 10 minutes. CSX cut trains on only a handful of the hundreds of
occasions on which this occurred, and the STB eventually removed the
requirement at CSX's request because it was effectively useless. Our
railroads should be held to basic standards of good faith, which CSX's
consistent failure to cut trains completely negated. If CSX found that
it was just too hard to comply with the condition, that is a
significant indication that it is unable to operate effectively on the
line.
b)  Cooperate with school and park districts to identify at-
grade crossings where additional pedestrian warning devices may be
warranted, and provide informational materials concerning railroad
safety to elementary, middle and high schools within 0.5 miles of the
Elsdon Line.
c)  Notify Emergency Service Dispatching Centers for
communities along the affected segments of all crossings blocked by
trains that are stopped and may be unable to move for a significant
period of time.
d)  Work with affected communities to minimize emergency
vehicle delay by maintaining facilities for emergency communication
with local Emergency Response Centers through a dedicated toll-free
telephone number.
e)  To further assist with the timely response of emergency
service providers for the Advocate Christ Medical Center and the Little
Company of Mary Hospital, CSX shall consult with all appropriate
agencies and hospitals to install a closed-circuit television system
(CCTV) with video cameras (or another comparable system or acceptable
option) so that the movement of trains can be predicted at the 95th
Street highway/rail at-grade crossing.
5.  This last point is extremely important. Advocate Christ
Medical Center, just across the border in Oak Lawn, lies just to the
west of the Elsdon Line, and the Little Company of Mary Hospital in
Evergreen Park, just to the east of the line, are the primary health
care facilities serving the 19th Ward. In fact, Advocate Christ serves
the entire South Side of Chicago as a Level 1 Trauma Center and
describes itself as the busiest Level 1 Trauma Center in Illinois. One
of the first indications that all was not right on the Elsdon Line
beginning in 2013 was the emergence of reports that emergency response
vehicles were being blocked by slow or stopped trains, or by
malfunctioning gates. When severely injured patients cannot get to the
hospital, lives are literally at risk.
B.  By late 2015, local Aldermen and state representatives were
hearing every day from constituents with complaints about blocked at-
grade crossings. Together with the Village of Evergreen Park, the City
of Chicago petitioned the STB to make CSX abide by the conditions it
had agreed to. We presented detailed evidence compiled over the course
of CSX's operations on the Elsdon Line to prove that the railroad was
consistently failing to comply with the conditions in its operating
license.
C.  Community letters: I will shortly share with you various
comments from the community about the impact of blocked at-grade
crossings. As you can imagine, in a dense urban area it does not take
long for significant traffic backups to form, so that even if motorists
want to seek a way around a blocked at-grade crossing, they can't.
However, pedestrian safety is perhaps an even more urgent concern, as
I'll describe. On two occasions, in 2016 and 2018, my office solicited
letters for the record of the STB proceeding and got well over 200
unique responses. Here are the most pressing themes I heard from my
community:
1.  Multiple instances of schoolchildren walking to school and
climbing through a stopped train--as related by a number of commenters.
I hope I do not need to highlight how incredibly dangerous this is.
2.  Multiple accounts of parents unable to get their kids to or
from school or daycare, missed medical appointments, missed flights,
and residents being docked pay because they were late to work. One pair
of newlyweds missed the first hour of their own wedding reception.
3.  Most poignantly, one commenter could not reach the Little
Company of Mary Hospital when her grandfather was dying and missed
saying her goodbyes to him by 15 minutes because of a train blocking an
at-grade crossing.
4.  Most alarmingly from a public safety perspective, there are
multiple accounts from physicians, police officers and fire/rescue/EMT
personnel describing instances when they could not respond to an
emergency or could not secure adequate backup because of a train
blocking an at-grade crossing. As one career fire fighter explained,
``every minute a cardiac arrest victim goes without CPR means a 10%
decrease in survival rate. 10 minutes in those cases means zero chance
to save a life.'' A doctor at Advocate Christ noted that 15 minutes can
determine success or failure in saving a fetus in distress.
III.  Current conditions
A.  Conditions have improved since we began our regulatory effort
with the STB in 2016, but the problem is not completely solved: we
still experience several blocked at-grade crossings each month. In
addition, the STB has taken the very unusual position of holding off on
specific action,\2\ leaving the community in a wait-and-see stance.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ CSX Transportation, Inc.--Acquisition of Operating Easement--
Grand Trunk Western R.R. Co., STB Docket No. 35522 (Service Date Dec.
10, 2018).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.  I note that rail traffic across the country has been decreasing
in the time that CSX has operated the Elsdon Line, and that alone may
account for any decrease in blocked at-grade crossings. We cannot be at
the mercy of the commodity markets to know if our community will remain
safe.
IV.  Federal Regulation has failed to protect the 19th Ward from the
effects of CSX's operations:
A.  The bottom line here is that the federal government has largely
failed us. CSX is essentially unregulated from our standpoint. When
acquiring the line, the railroad had to make promises to the STB, the
most substantial of which were cutting the trains and installing closed
circuit TVs to hospitals.
B.  I emphasize that the conditions the STB imposed indicate a
clear recognition that railroads must be responsible to the communities
in which they operate, and that, rather than acting with impunity,
railroads must not be permitted to cause harm to the public, as has
happened in the 19th Ward and surrounding communities.
C.  Several years later we brought to the STB that CSX didn't do
these things--there is no follow up or mechanism to ensure they are
doing what they say. Advocate Christ Hospital to this day doesn't have
the TV equipment (we assume Little Company of Mary also doesn't but
they did not respond to our inquiry in time for this hearing).
D.  But here's the biggest question--why doesn't anyone from the
STB confirm whether CSX is abiding by its promises? The STB is the
federal agency responsible for setting conditions on railroads,
granting them permission to operate, and revoking that permission when
the railroad fails to live up to its promises. Here, the STB initially
imposed very specific requirements on the railroad in order to prevent
the very situation we are living with today.
E.  Why didn't STB fine CSX or impose other penalties when the
agency learned CSX was out of compliance with its operating conditions
on the Elsdon Line? Why do we allow this huge company to just tell us
they did something and take their word for it? How can local
communities rely on the promises of the railroads or the enforcement
powers of the federal government if nobody will do anything--even when
there have been repeated, consistent, and demonstrated violations? THIS
is why action by Congress is necessary.
V.  Now I'll focus on how this Subcommittee and the Congress as a whole
can help. Existing federal regulation does not adequately
protect communities from the effects of blocked at-grade
crossings and malfunctioning crossing gates.
A.  Federal regulation is pervasive in the railroad industry except
when it comes to at-grade crossings.
B.  The current regulatory approach, which treats at-grade
crossings primarily as a road safety issue regulated by individual
states, is ineffective.
VI.  Without action by Congress, the situation is only likely to get
worse.
A.  The Federal government recognizes that at-grade crossings are a
significant safety concern:
1.  In May 2019, in response to concerns from members of
Congress, the Governmental Accounting Office issued a report urging
Congress to direct the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) to address
the significant impacts of ever-longer freight trains, which today are
frequently 2 miles, and in some cases 3 miles, long.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ U.S. Gov't Accountability Office, GAO-19-443, Rail Safety:
Freight Trains are Getting Longer, and Additional Information is Needed
to Assess Their Impact (2019), at 1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
a)  This report specifically recommended that FRA engage with
railroads, state and local governments, to (a) identify community-
specific impacts of train operations, including longer trains, where
streets and highways cross railroad rights-of-way and (b) develop
potential solutions to reduce those impacts.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\4\ Id. at 28.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  In December 2019, the FRA set up a web portal where members
of the public and law enforcement can report blocked at-grade
crossings: https://www.fra.dot.gov/blockedcrossings/.
a)  In announcing the effort, FRA pointed out that ``there are
no federal laws or regulations pertaining to blocked crossings.''
b)  Creation of the website is an indication that FRA
recognizes that at-grade crossing safety is a significant issue for
communities.
3.  I emphasize that the 19th Ward and Evergreen Park have been
successful in securing improvements in CSX's performance on the Elsdon
Line only because of the specific conditions placed on the railroad by
the STB. Communities should not have the burden to protect themselves
on a case- by-case basis to make sure railroads do not have a seriously
harmful impact. Where railroad operations already exist, there is no
opportunity to force railroads to operate without harm to the
surrounding community.
VII.  As the representative of a heavily-impacted community, I propose
today some straightforward measures Congress can enact that
will simply and effectively improve at-grade crossing safety
without burdening railroad operations:
A.  Require moving trains to clear at-grade crossings in three
minutes or less.
B.  If a train blocks an at-grade crossing for 10 minutes or more--
whether the train is stopped or in motion--impose fines for every
minute a blockage persists at each crossing.
C.  These straightforward performance-focused measures give
railroads full discretion and flexibility to take whatever measures
they require to achieve compliance.

It's that simple.
I thank the Subcommittee for your time today and would be happy to
answer any questions.

Mr. Lipinski. Thank you, Alderman O'Shea.
I will now recognize Mr. Morris for 5 minutes.
Mr. Morris. Mr. Chairman, members of the subcommittee, good
morning and thank you. My name is Jason Morris. I lead the
Safety and Environmental Department at Norfolk Southern
Corporation, and I appreciate the opportunity to provide the
subcommittee with NS's perspective on the importance of grade
crossing safety and addressing community concerns.
Our industry has been around a long time. NS's earliest
predecessor began operations in 1830. While our industry
expanded through most of the 19th century, the rail system in
the U.S. was fully built out in about 1916 when railroad route-
miles began to shrink.
Since that time, the communities we serve have continued to
grow up around us. Population increases around rail corridors,
combined with explosive growth in route-miles and vehicular
traffic, have created a network of grade crossings that present
challenges.
There are over 200,000 grade crossings in our country, and
collisions at these crossings, along with trespasser incidents
that are often nearby, account for over 90 percent of rail-
related fatalities. Although crossing accidents per million
train-miles have declined by more than 75 percent over the last
40 years, and the accident rate adjusted for both train-miles
and vehicle-miles traveled has actually improved 17 percent
since 2007, we should not become complacent. Behind these
statistics are human beings, and we are committed to continuing
a push to zero incidents.
We also recognize that as we conduct our operations through
grade crossings, those operations can have community impacts,
especially in higher growth communities and those where land-
use planning has not accounted for the presence of rail
corridors. Grade crossing elimination and consolidation
projects are the surest means of avoiding crossing accidents
and occupied crossings.
Finally, trespassing on railroad property is also of great
concern. Enforcement and education are key to reducing the rate
of trespasser deaths and injuries. Addressing these issues will
take all levels of Government, industry, labor, and
nongovernmental organizations. I would like to give you a few
examples of initiatives that NS has undertaken in these areas
with partners.
Last year, we began utilizing Waze technology and its
unique advertising platform to test a novel approach to
increasing crossing safety awareness. We were able to target
audiences with crossing awareness messages where they need them
most--in their vehicles. We were also able to avoid
distractions by guaranteeing that these notifications would
only go to stopped vehicles.
Since the project commenced, the technology has reached
more than 3 million drivers. More importantly, there have been
no collisions in the targeted locations.
We also have been enthusiastic partners with the Indiana
DOT's Local Trax Program. This program provided $125 million
for grant opportunities to Indiana localities interested in
pursuing high-priority rail safety projects. Local Trax has
encouraged partnership among the governments, private business,
and railroads, to increase safety, improve mobility, and
enhance quality of life.
NS and local communities were successful in identifying
more than 20 crossings that could benefit from separation
projects and are moving toward completing construction by the
end of 2024 and this is a great example of industry and
Government working together.
As for trespassing, NS police warned and removed about
12,000 trespassers from our tracks and property last year.
While enforcement efforts are essential, NS plays an active
role in promoting rail safety in our communities through
education.
Through the Trespasser Abatement Program, or TAP, NS police
hold events across our system to educate people about the
dangers of trespassing. In addition to TAP, NS police will
teach a course in 2020 for local law enforcement officers that
focuses on safety and techniques for investigating collisions
involving trains and vehicles.
Finally, we will continue to provide safety training to
first responders through our Operation Awareness and Response
Program, or OAR. OAR safety training will conduct an 18-stop
tour across our system in 2020.
Congress can be of great help as we work toward further
improvements in grade crossing and trespasser safety and
minimizing the impact of avoidable grade crossing occupations.
I have set forth several recommendations in my written
testimony regarding the importance of section 130 program
funding levels and sources, the use of technology, and the
essential role public education plays, including the work of
Operation Lifesaver.
NS is committed to operating the safest, most customer-
focused, and successful transportation company in the world,
and that includes tracking towards zero accidents and
incidents. We will continue to work cooperatively with all
stakeholders to achieve these aims and to ensure that North
American railroads remain the envy of the world.
Thank you.
[Mr. Morris' prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Jason M. Morris, Assistant Vice President, Safety
and Environmental, Norfolk Southern Corporation
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee:
I appreciate the opportunity to provide the Subcommittee with
Norfolk Southern's perspective on the importance of improving grade
crossing safety and addressing community concerns. We think these
issues can be addressed most effectively in partnership with federal,
state, and local government, industry, labor, and non-governmental
organizations. Collisions at grade crossings, along with incidents
involving trespassers on railroad rights of way, are critical safety
issues. They account for well over 90 percent of rail-related
fatalities. Although these incidents usually arise from factors that
are outside of railroad control, Norfolk Southern and other railroads
are committed to working with other stakeholders to reduce their
frequency.
Norfolk Southern believes that industry and government should
continue to work together to improve grade crossing safety and to
minimize avoidable occupations of crossings. To that end, we would like
to offer several policy recommendations to this Subcommittee:

First, funding for the federal Section 130 program, which
provides funds to eliminate hazards at highway-rail grade crossings,
should be maintained to at least current levels ($245 million in fiscal
year 2020) or increased.

Second, the Section 130 program should continue to
receive dedicated formula funding out of the Highway Safety Improvement
Program.

Third, Section 130 incentive payments for grade crossing
closures should be increased from the current cap of $7,500 to
$100,000.

Fourth, federal policy should incentivize states to
bundle grade crossing projects into a single grant application under
applicable programs, such as BUILD, INFRA, or CRISI.

Fifth, federal policy should require or incentivize the
accelerated deployment of navigational warnings (through means such as
smart phone applications) for motorists approaching grade crossings.

Sixth, federal policy should require future fleets of
automated vehicles to provide grade crossing warnings and/or prevent
driving over grade crossings when a train is approaching.

Seventh, Congress should authorize at least $3 million
per year for Operation Lifesaver through FHWA, FRA, and FTA.

Finally, Congress should encourage FMCSA to evaluate the
effectiveness of its grade crossing safety training in driver education
programs administered by the agency for commercial drivers, and,
federal policy, through NHTSA, should encourage states to incorporate
grade crossing safety training into their driver education programs.
Background
Norfolk Southern is a leading North American transportation
provider. Its Norfolk Southern Railway Company subsidiary operates
approximately 19,500 route miles in 22 states and the District of
Columbia, serves every major container port in the eastern United
States, and provides efficient connections to other rail carriers.
Norfolk Southern is a major transporter of industrial products,
including chemicals, agriculture, and metals and construction
materials. In addition, the railroad operates the most extensive
intermodal network in the East and is a principal carrier of coal,
automobiles, and automotive parts.
Norfolk Southern's predecessors were at the forefront of the
railroad industry's development. The South Carolina Canal and Railroad
was chartered in 1827 and placed its first locomotive into service in
1830. Soon other companies built rail lines to connect markets in the
eastern United States, and within 40 years railroads had crossed the
North American continent.
As the railroad industry expanded, the communities we serve grew up
around us. With increasing population and the advent of the automobile,
states and localities embarked on extensive street and road-building
programs, an effort the federal government joined early in the 20th
Century. By 1916, railroad system mileage in the United States had
peaked at about 254,000 route-miles, declining to approximately 138,000
route-miles today. But as the footprint of the railroad system began to
shrink, the automobile revolution was just getting started. There were
about 2.8 million miles of public roads in 1916, and that number had
grown to 4.2 million miles by 2018. Automotive traffic volume increased
even more dramatically over that 102-year period. There were 25.8
billion vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in 1916 compared to 3.2 trillion
in 2018, a 124-fold increase. Meanwhile, the number of trains operating
over the rail network declined. Combined passenger and Class I freight
train-miles stood at 1.2 billion in 1929, the earliest year for which
data is available. By 2018, that total had been reduced to around 591
million, or cut by almost half.
The growth in population and vehicular traffic in proximity to the
rail system, combined with local land use planning that rarely accounts
for the presence of rail corridors through communities, has made
interactions between trains and vehicles at grade crossings a
challenge. According to the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA),
there are over 130,000 public grade crossings in the United States
today, with another nearly 80,000 private crossings. By law,
automobiles are required to yield to trains and other on-track
equipment at each of these grade crossings to prevent accidents. Trains
are almost always unable to stop for vehicles that occupy crossings, so
driver behavior is the critical factor in grade crossing safety. In
fact, a U.S. Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General
report attributed 94 percent of grade crossing accidents to risky
driver behavior or poor judgment.
In 1975, the earliest year for which the FRA has data, there were
more than 12,000 grade crossing accidents in which nearly 1,000 people
lost their lives. Since then, the number of highway-rail grade crossing
accidents has dropped more than 80% to approximately 2,200 accidents
per year, involving 250 fatalities. The FRA maintains a statistic of
highway-rail grade crossing accidents per million train miles to
express how many highway-rail grade crossing accidents occur per
million miles that trains operate. By that measure, the accident rate
has declined more than 75% since the early 1980s.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

While long and mid-term progress have been impressive--a more than
35% reduction in highway-rail grade crossing accidents since 2000--the
rate of grade crossing accidents has been relatively flat since 2007.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

While some may view this recent performance as unimpressive, we
must keep in mind that it took place over a period in which VMT
increased by approximately 200 billion miles (from approximately 3
trillion miles in 2007 to 3.2 trillion miles in 2018), an increase of
nearly 7%. Only using train miles to normalize grade crossing accident
statistics omits the major role of vehicular traffic volume on grade
crossing accident rates. By introducing VMT into the statistical
evaluation and accounting for both train and vehicular activity, we get
a better sense of the rate of grade crossing accidents. When we compare
grade crossing accident numbers in this manner, we actually see a 17%
improvement during this most recent period. It is important to note
that this improvement has occurred in a period during which hand-held
electronic devices (and their attendant driver distraction issues) have
become commonplace, suggesting that the impact of grade crossing safety
efforts is actually understated.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

I want to emphasize that in any discussion of statistical trends we
should not forget that behind these numbers are human beings. Grade
crossing accidents have a lasting impact, not only to the occupants of
the vehicles but also to the train crews who sometimes witness the last
moments of a fellow human being's life. Despite the progress that has
been made in reducing grade crossing accidents, the rail industry is
not satisfied. At Norfolk Southern, we are engaged in a variety of
innovative and proactive efforts utilizing the timeless ``3 Es'' of
grade crossing safety (Engineering, Education and Enforcement) in
partnership with government and others as we work toward the goal of
zero accidents.
The Section 130 Program and Other Forms of Governmental Support are
Critical to Continued Progress in Grade Crossing Safety and Minimizing
Community Impacts.
Grade Crossing Consolidation and Grade Separation Projects
Removing redundant and unnecessary crossings is a critical factor
in improving safety. Combining consolidation efforts with grade
separation projects eliminates the interaction of trains and vehicles
at remaining crossings and can permanently address local concerns with
trains occupying crossings when demands on the roadways are high (such
as during rush hour or when emergency services vehicles need to
traverse railroad tracks).
Grade separation projects are expensive, and the federal Section
130 program is a cornerstone of many grade crossing elimination efforts
with states and localities. In light of its importance to grade
crossing safety and the prevention of occupied crossings, funding for
the Section 130 program should be increased or at least remain at
currently authorized levels ($245 million in fiscal year 2020). In
addition, the dependability of funding sources remains essential to
facilitating the ongoing planning efforts that are important to long-
term project development. To that end, the Section 130 program should
continue to receive dedicated formula funding out of the Highway Safety
Improvement Program.
The rail industry will continue to do its part. The railroads
themselves spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year on grade
crossing improvements and maintenance. And several railroads, including
Norfolk Southern, have been active partners in the CREATE program, a
first of its kind project that funds infrastructure programs to address
community impacts in the Chicago area, including separations or
improvements at 47 different grade crossings.
Not only should the Section 130 program be preserved, we think
adjusting the crossing closure incentive cap from $7,500 to $100,000
would make it even more effective. The hundreds of meetings Norfolk
Southern has had with localities over the last several years have
revealed the continued importance of incentive payments to closing
grade crossings. Although all involved parties can appreciate the
importance of grade crossing safety, crossing closures have real costs
that need to be addressed. Increasing the current Section 130 incentive
payment cap of $7,500 would allow for the benefits of these projects to
be more evenly spread across communities that need the additional
assistance and allow for partnerships to take place that might not
otherwise be possible due to a lack of resources.
Incentivizing Partnerships such as the Indiana Local Trax program
Norfolk Southern operates approximately 1,440 miles of track in
Indiana, transporting finished vehicles, agricultural products, and
construction materials throughout the Hoosier State. In serving our
customers, our railroad operates over 2,670 public and private grade
crossings. In April 2018, the Indiana Department of Transportation
announced $125 million in available funds through the agency's ``Local
Trax'' Rail Overpass program, which provides a one-time grant
opportunity to Indiana cities, towns, and counties interested in
pursuing high-priority railroad safety projects such as grade
separations, crossing closures, and other safety enhancements at
railroad intersections with local roads. The criteria for evaluating
projects include: project viability, financial match, hazard index at
the crossing, average daily automobile traffic, freight train traffic,
number of crossing closures, and community population.
At its core, the impact of the innovative Local Trax program has
been to encourage partnership among the State, local governments,
private businesses, and railroads to increase safety, improve mobility,
and enhance the quality of life for Hoosiers. As Indiana is
consistently ranked in the top 5 states for collisions between trains
and cars, Norfolk Southern is pleased to be a partner in the Local Trax
program and strongly supports its mission to improve safety for
Hoosiers throughout the State. Norfolk Southern and local communities
have identified more than 20 crossings that could benefit from
separation projects, with a goal of completing construction by the end
of 2024.
Innovative programs like Local Trax help fuel continued improvement
in grade crossing safety and serve as templates for similar programs in
other states. Even without a Local Trax-type program, states and
communities can benefit from a coordinated approach to grouping
projects to maximize impact. To further encourage this type of
thoughtful planning, federal policy should incentivize states to bundle
grade crossing projects into a single grant application under
applicable programs, such as BUILD, INFRA, or CRISI. A lack of public
transportation planning at the corridor level, focused on eliminating
train/vehicle interaction, is a significant hurdle to grade separation
bundling coming together. Planning could be encouraged with an
increased Section 130 allotment so that communities can adequately
prepare corridor programs of multiple grade separations in advance of
grant opportunities.
Beyond Crossing Consolidation and Grade Separation
Norfolk Southern realizes that the immediate elimination of every
grade crossing is not practical or possible. Therefore, our efforts
extend into other areas to improve highway rail grade crossing safety
and reduce avoidable occupied crossing issues.
Norfolk Southern maintains a robust vegetation management program
to clear our right of way of potential obstructions and ensure
compliance with applicable laws and regulations. This program is an
important part of Norfolk Southern's efforts to remove potential sight
obstructions at highway-rail grade crossings and to ensure that train
crews can see railway signals. The program includes mowing, brush
cutting, tree removal, and selective herbicide application by qualified
and licensed professionals within the railroad's rights of way with
careful consideration of the environment.
Norfolk Southern is also involved in numerous efforts with local
communities and with customers to minimize the impact of operations on
local roadway traffic by investing in innovative projects. For example,
in Leighton, AL, we are involved in a safety corridor project that
includes crossing profile improvements, the installation and upgrade of
active warning devices, and a grade crossing closure. With a
combination of willpower and creativity, the railroad and the community
have come together to achieve a lasting solution.
Finally, we have undertaken operating changes that have safely
increased both the fluidity of our network and average train speed.
While these changes have been made to improve efficiency and service,
the Government Accountability Office noted in a 2016 report that train
speed is a relevant factor in the amount of time a train occupies a
crossing. Norfolk Southern's average train speed has increased from
19.1 miles per hour in 2018 to 22.3 miles per hour in 2019 (a 17%
improvement). These operating changes have had the additional benefit
of reducing terminal dwell and creating additional capacity on our
network, which further reduces community impacts at grade crossings.
Education and Technology are Key to Grade Crossing Safety.
Leveraging WAZE Technology

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

In 2019, Norfolk Southern began using WAZE technology to test a
novel approach to increasing grade crossing safety awareness. By
utilizing WAZE's unique advertising platform, Norfolk Southern was able
to target audiences in key locations to receive crossing awareness
messages while in the very place they often need it most--their
vehicles. By using a geo-fence around specially selected locations,
Norfolk Southern was able to target messages to WAZE users to receive
safety notifications in the vicinity of these areas and increase
awareness even on trips where they may not drive across crossings. The
notifications (as pictured above) include a cross buck graphic and a
grade crossing safety message, along with a link to a website with more
railroad safety information. By placing limitations on the messaging,
we were also able to guarantee that the notifications would only be
delivered once the user's vehicle is stopped to prevent any
distractions.
Thus far, the pilot project targeted 44 grade crossings in the
following areas where 135 incidents have occurred in the past:

Seven crossings in the Southwest Birmingham, Alabama area

Nine crossings in the Gary, Indiana area

Four crossings in the Atlanta/DeKalb County, Georgia area

Seven crossings in the Toledo, Ohio area

Five crossings in the Allegheny County, Pennsylvania area

Twelve crossings in the East Louisville, Kentucky area

Since the project commenced, the technology has reached more than 3
million drivers. More importantly, there have been no collisions at any
of the crossings in the targeted locations.
The initial phase of the project ran through the end of 2019. In
2020, the goal is to expand the program locations, include enhanced
WAZE content, and link it to a more targeted safety message that will
be housed on the Norfolk Southern www.pulling-together.com website.
The Norfolk Southern WAZE initiative has just scratched the surface
of the potential for developing the safety benefits of navigational
guidance, automated vehicle operations and other technology. Federal
policy can and should continue to support the accelerated deployment of
navigational warnings (through means such as smart phone applications)
for motorists approaching grade crossings. Furthermore, as we move into
a future with automated vehicles, federal policy should require that
such technologies include the capability to provide grade crossing
warnings and prevent drivers from entering over grade crossings when
trains are approaching. This capability should also be independent of
any railroad systems, such as Positive Train Control, which are not
designed to communicate with automobiles.
Expanding Operating Awareness and Response Training
In addition, Norfolk Southern is expanding our use of the Operation
Awareness and Response (OAR) Safety Training to include grade crossing
safety material in the programs that it provides. This effort will help
to bridge the connections with first responders by providing
information and training resources and to educate the public about the
safe movement of hazardous materials by rail. In 2019, the OAR program
trained 2,428 first responders across the Norfolk Southern network
using a rolling learning lab that helps communities prepare for and
safely respond to potential rail incidents. In 2020, the program kicks
off an 18-stop tour across our system. The 2020 schedule and additional
information on the program is available at http://www.joinnsoar.com.
Operation Lifesaver is Key to Educational Efforts.
Norfolk Southern and our other railroad partners strongly advocate
for continued Federal support for Operation Lifesaver. This federal
support has been key to the program's success as demonstrated by the
recent launch of a new ``Near Miss'' public service announcement
targeting distracted pedestrians that was made possible by funding from
the FRA as well as the generosity of organizations like the Posner
Foundation of Pittsburgh.
While the new campaign focuses attention on the danger of
distractions for pedestrians, distracted driving remains a significant
threat when it comes to highway rail crossing safety. Organizations
like Operation Lifesaver will remain important partners in the efforts
to educate motorists about the dangers of distraction when driving near
railroad tracks and to spread the important message of grade crossing
safety in our schools and communities. To ensure the important work of
this organization continues, Congress should authorize at least $3
million per year for Operation Lifesaver through FHWA, FRA, and FTA.
Other Opportunities Exist For Community Education and Enforcement
Walking on railroad tracks is dangerous and illegal. In 2019,
Norfolk Southern police warned and ejected 11,883 individuals for
trespassing on tracks and other railroad property. Norfolk Southern
police also arrested 566 individuals for trespassing. While enforcement
efforts are essential, Norfolk Southern's Police Department plays an
active role in promoting rail safety in our communities through
education. Through the department's Trespasser Abatement Program, or
TAP, NS police hold a series of events in communities across our system
to educate people about the dangers of walking on or near railroad
tracks.
In 2019, Norfolk Southern police held six of the two-day TAPs in
locations selected based on the previous year's trespassing activity
and pedestrian injuries or fatalities on railroad property. The 2019
events focused on the Gastonia, NC; Hamilton, OH; Johnson City, TN;
Sandusky, OH; Greenville, SC; and Louisville, KY areas. The events
included meeting with local law enforcement, talking with community
members, patrolling the tracks, and handing out antitrespassing
brochures.
In addition to TAP, Norfolk Southern police will teach a course in
2020 for local law enforcement officers that focuses on safety and
techniques for investigating collisions involving trains and motor
vehicles at highway-rail grade crossings.
As I mentioned in my introductory remarks, there is a human
dimension to grade crossing and trespasser incidents that cannot be
ignored, and that includes the impact to train crews involved in
accidents. Norfolk Southern and other railroads have Critical Incident
Stress Plans to ensure crewmembers have access to counseling and other
assistance in the aftermath of a trespasser or highway-rail grade
crossing accident. Those plans are on file with labor organizations,
and their efforts to communicate the availability of this assistance to
their members is vitally important. But the best course of action is to
continue working to prevent these accidents from ever occurring. As we
work to address grade crossing safety, we should remember that
trespasser prevention is a closely linked topic, and the education and
awareness aimed at trespassers can often have an impact on improving
driver behavior in the vicinity of crossings too.
With respect to addressing occupied crossings and other grade
crossing safety matters at individual crossings, education efforts will
continue to emphasize that every crossing has a blue emergency
notification sign posted with a 24/7 emergency phone number and an
identification number unique to that crossing so callers can
immediately communicate issues at crossings with the responsible
railroad. Getting real-time information allows railroads to coordinate
with communities to identify workable short- and long-term solutions to
mitigate crossing impacts. In some instances that coordination allows
railroads to be able to provide real-time information about a current
occupied crossing and an estimated time for when the issue may be
resolved.
While driver inattention, distraction, and failure to understand
and/or follow laws regarding highway rail grade crossings are a
problem, the failure of professional drivers in these areas is
particularly disturbing. More than 660 of the 1830 highway-rail grade
crossing accidents in the FRA database for the first ten months of 2019
(over 35%) involve trucks, trucks and trailers, vans or buses. A
sizeable portion of these accidents likely involve professional drivers
over which the federal government exercises enhanced control through
the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA). At a minimum,
FMCSA should evaluate whether currently provided grade crossing safety
training in driver education programs for commercial drivers is
effective. Furthermore, NHTSA should encourage states to incorporate
grade crossing safety training in their driver education programs for
all drivers, and apply any lessons learned from FMCSA's experience.
Norfolk Southern is committed to operating the safest, most
customer-focused and successful transportation company in the world. We
will continue to work cooperatively with federal, state, and local
governments to achieve these aims and to ensure that North American
railroads remain the envy of the world. We appreciate this opportunity
to testify and look forward to working with the subcommittee to
developing meaningful solutions to reach zero grade crossing accidents
and incidents.

Mr. Lipinski. Thank you, Mr. Morris.
We will now move on to questions. I will begin by
recognizing the chair of the full committee, Mr. DeFazio, for 5
minutes.
Mr. DeFazio. I thank the chair for holding this important
hearing as we work towards surface reauthorization, which will
include a robust rail title.
Mr. Alexy, last June we had the Administrator, Mr. Batory,
before the subcommittee, and I asked, ``Should train length be
limited?'' He didn't exactly address the question. There was no
direct response. In fact, later he indicated he didn't think
there was much problem with 3-mile-long trains with a one-
person crew.
But he did later say that the FRA should not become
involved with blocked crossings because such authority is
currently with the States and municipalities. Well, clearly,
because of a series of State court decisions and preemption,
they can't do anything. So that is kind of a nonanswer.
But then, apparently in recognition there might be some
sort of a problem, he did later write and say that there should
be some action on this issue and urge the freight railroads,
and then you reinforced that in December. What steps have been
taken by freight rail since that time?
Mr. Alexy. Thank you for the question. Just a
clarification, regarding train length?
Mr. DeFazio. Well, it is train length, which leads to
blocked crossings.
Mr. Alexy. So we haven't taken any specific steps other
than our enforcement efforts that we do. We--you know, when we
do our--when we go out and we do audits of the train operations
to ensure that--a number of things. One, that the crew is
properly trained and certified and they understand the
territory over which they are traveling, and that the equipment
is safe. So it is an ongoing----
Mr. DeFazio. Right. But the issue is, and you heard
eloquently from Alderman O'Shea and others who raised concerns,
that because of pressure from Wall Street, we are moving to
destroying the freight industry with Precision Scheduled
Railroading, which may improve stockholder profitability but
has a whole lot of other problems.
So the question is, it seems like after that hearing,
ultimately Mr. Batory wrote to the railroads, and then you
later reinforced that. And my question is: has there been any
action taken by the railroads? Have they even communicated back
with you saying, ``Yeah, we get it. There is a problem, and we
are going to work on this''?
Mr. Alexy. So we did reach out. You are correct, and I----
Mr. DeFazio. Have they responded?
Mr. Alexy. We did get responses to say that we are----
Mr. DeFazio. Meaningful responses?
Mr. Alexy. They were. You know, they acknowledged the
problem, and they are taking a variety of steps.
Mr. DeFazio. OK. Please, we would like to see their written
responses.
Mr. Alexy. OK.
Mr. DeFazio. Would you provide those?
Mr. Alexy. Yes.
Mr. DeFazio. That would be great. Is FRA confident that if
you have a 3-mile-long train that the end-of-train device's
distributed power units and communications work over--we have
heard repeated anecdotal testimony that particularly in
challenged terrain or tunnels there is no communication between
the front and back of the train, 3 miles long.
Are you confident that there are no issues regarding 3-
mile-long trains that raise safety issues, braking or
communication or anything else?
Mr. Alexy. I think that that is something that the
railroads need to take into consideration when they do train
makeup. They have to understand the territory over which that
train will be traveling. So if there are going to be challenges
with the territory on communications, they need to adjust train
length accordingly. So there are operational and terrain issues
that they need to take into account.
Mr. DeFazio. So if they were running a 3-mile-long train
through mountainous terrain where we could prove or we would
know that the inadequate radio systems they have--not
satellite-based--couldn't communicate, would that be a safety
violation that would be fineable?
Mr. Alexy. That would be a problem if we identified that
there was a loss of communications over the allowed time in the
Federal regulations, yes.
Mr. DeFazio. OK. Thanks.
And, Alderman O'Shea, very quickly, my understanding is STB
imposed restrictions to allow the use of that route and those
things have just been not enforced. Is that correct?
Mr. O'Shea. Yes. The main thing is a closed-circuit
television feed to our two local hospitals--Little Company of
Mary Hospital, which is one-half mile east of Elsdon Line, and
Advocate Christ Medical Center, again, as I mentioned, the only
trauma center on the Southwest Side of Chicago.
Mr. DeFazio. And do you have any legal recourse with it? I
mean----
Mr. O'Shea. No, sir.
Mr. DeFazio. OK. None. OK. I just wanted to let you know my
mother's name was Dorothy Margaret O'Shea. Maybe we are distant
relatives. Anyway, thanks. Thanks very much for being here.
Mr. O'Shea. Thank you, sir.
Mr. Lipinski. The Chair will now recognize Ranking Member
Crawford for 5 minutes.
Mr. Crawford. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Morris, I have a question for you. We have heard a lot
of testimony this morning about the impacts, grade crossing
issues, safety issues, certainly blocked crossings, and so on,
as applies to urban environments. I have some questions about
how this impacts rural communities.
Certainly, we are affected by that, too, and one of the
other challenges we face in rural communities, like the
district that I represent, is we don't have the resources, the
funding, to actually address those issues.
What are some ways you might suggest that railroads, State
and Federal Governments, and Congress, in fact, can help ensure
that rural communities are able to address that issue?
Mr. Morris. Well, thank you for your question, Congressman.
I think that is a great question. Obviously, high-density
areas, there are going to be community impacts, but those
community impacts can also occur in rural areas.
There are some great opportunities and examples where we
have had some success. One, a Leighton, Alabama, project where
we were able to work with the Alabama Department of
Transportation on a project that--and, really, what it was--
what were able to do is take more of a corridor, larger area
approach, and get changes in crossing configuration, including
the installation of active warning devices at some public
passive crossings, modifications for flashers to flashing
lights and gates at another public crossing in the area,
closures, and putting in a siting extension that not only
increased network capacity but allowed us an area for a train
to stage where it would not impact any public grade crossings.
I think when we look to projects like that, when you can
take an area--and this goes to one of the recommendations made
in the written testimony--that the work of this committee to
continue to advocate for Federal policy to incentivize States
to bundle projects, grade crossing projects into a single grant
application, and some of the other written testimony of people
on here about clarifying who is eligible for those, I think
those are steps that when we look at BUILD, INFRA, and CRISI,
can allow you to start to, we will say, create a force
multiplier because particularly in rural areas the solution to
one community's problem may be able to spread out and hit
several other communities I think as we improve our ability to
say, ``Hey, this could be a larger issue,'' and the solution
may involve more than just, you know, one small community.
Mr. Crawford. Thank you. I yield back.
Mr. Lipinski. I now recognize myself for 5 minutes, and I
will begin with talking about the blocked crossings, and
Alderman O'Shea gave some compelling examples of the impact.
I want to ask, Mr. Vercruysse, what do you--can you expand
on why you think a Federal blocked crossing law would be
effective? And how would--what would you recommend in terms of
that law? And what would the impact be on the railroads with
this?
Mr. Vercruysse. Currently, we have had, you know, a number
of examples where we have been able to work with railroads
successfully to change operations, as Mr. Morris said, and try
and alleviate concerns. But it is not under a direct process or
something that would give the ground rules for that discussion,
and sometimes we have seen where the concern then ends up on a
different section of the line.
So especially for change in operation locations, I believe
that the use of a Federal law to identify how this is supposed
to be investigated, whether it is by FRA inspectors, State-
certified inspectors, or others, and how we communicate and
coordinate with the railroads, should be defined.
For locations where we have continuous blockage and we
haven't been able to come up with a successful solution, then a
penalty structure similar to what we have seen in other State
statutes for time where we get over the 10 minutes and above.
For historically heavy locations like we see on the South
Side of Chicago, our areas of Decatur, sections of Springfield,
and then the Illinois portion of the St. Louis district, I
would believe we should have safety plans in place, and then we
should always monitor to see if changes have created more
severity.
So under a Federal legislation package, maybe it is trying
to compile all of these different safety plans, get a good
understanding of the problem locations and what is in place, if
a larger train does break down. Again, we have had success
stories with trying to manage those issues. We have examples of
emergency plans in place in and around the Midway Airport of
Chicago, and those just need to be reviewed and continued
vigilance in them.
I hope that answers the question. If you have followup--
thank you.
Mr. Lipinski. Thank you. I want to move on to something
that I think there will be agreement upon, except for the
question of where the additional money is going to come from.
But grade separations--Mr. Christoffels, it is very impressive
to me--I have been to the Alameda Corridor, have not gone
through the East Corridor there, but this was, you know, as you
said, State and local money. And you mentioned how much Federal
money--the percentage of Federal money has gone down for grade
separation.
How much would you like to see going into the section 130
for grade separations? How would this have an impact on what
you are able to do in other locations in the country?
Mr. Christoffels. I think I can give you a monetary
example. As you know, that section 130 may be $200 to $300
million a year. For us, let's just say most recently, for
example, we have upgraded a crossing with pedestrian safety
gates. There are a lot of areas in the Nation that are now
doing that and using section 130 money to initiate that work.
Five crossings upgraded to quadrant gates and pedestrian
gates. It is going to cost us $24 million, and that is just
five crossings located in the city of Pomona in southern
California. You multiply that across all of the crossings
across the United States that could use similar improvements
and you realize how far that section 130 money actually takes
us, which is not very far at all.
As I stated earlier, the demand so far exceeds the funding
availability that we have out there, and there is only so much
that local agencies can contribute to those types of
improvements. There is only so much that local residents are
willing to tax themselves because it is a tradeoff, obviously,
for other things that they would get taxed for. And, you know,
as I stated earlier, much of this mitigation revolves around
interstate commerce, national goods movement, and I think it is
beholden upon the Federal Government to increase the amount of
funds that go into that section 130 program to address this
issue.
Mr. Lipinski. Thank you, and I will not abuse my role as
chair and go on another question, because my time is up now. So
I will now recognize Mr. Babin for 5 minutes.
Dr. Babin. Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank
you, witnesses, for being here. We appreciate it.
Continuing to improve safety at our highway-rail grade
crossings is of vital and life-saving significance. I hope in
response to this hearing we reaffirm our shared commitment on
the State, local and Federal levels to ensure that trains move
safely and efficiently, and that we work to minimize conflicts
in the communities in which they operate.
Given that U.S. freight shipments are estimated to go only
up in numbers, it is imperative that we continue to invest
resources, innovation and partnership into this space, as seen
in dedicated section 130 program funding over the years.
And, Mr. Morris, I'd like to ask you what sort of
technological advances is Norfolk Southern, or other railway
companies that you can speak on behalf of, embracing to enhance
safety and efficiency at our railroad crossings?
Mr. Morris. Well, we've already talked about our Waze
initiative as one, and I--first off, I'll say thank you for the
question. I think technology is going to be a big part of our
advancement. So that is one area that we have seen, with driver
behavior being such a huge component of grade crossing safety,
particularly when you look at the numbers associated with those
accidents, with 36 percent of the accidents of people, you
know, not stopping. Those types of numbers--any way that we
have to reach people is going to be very helpful with
addressing that next level. So that is one technology that we
have taken.
Other technologies, I know that we continue to work with
the FRA and others on putting in remote grade crossing
monitoring as one option that will give us better visibility
over what is happening at the grade crossing and the ability to
run analysis.
So there are several technological advances that we
continue to push, both on the education side and the
engineering side.
Dr. Babin. OK. And can you share any examples of
partnerships between technology companies and the railroad
industry that strive to help first responders and emergency
service vehicles to find alternate routes in real-time in order
to avoid delays that could threaten the lives of individuals
under their care? As our urban areas grow and roads become more
congested, these delays at crossings become even more acute.
Mr. Morris. Well, again, I think Waze is a start with a
partnership with a technology company. In terms of our first
responders, the FRA, there is already a regulation for
emergency notification signs that are in place. So, and that is
something that it is important, I think, for all drivers to
know, is that when you get to a crossing, there is a blue sign
at the crossing that has a toll-free number and identification
for that specific crossing. And what they may not see is that
feeds into a network operations center that we have.
Over the last year or so, Norfolk Southern centralized our
dispatching operations in Atlanta. So now with a network
operations center that's centered in Atlanta, we have all of
our dispatching operations, so when that call comes in to the
police communications center, you're able to get a real person
who can then plug that in and work with the network operations
center--they are all housed in the same building--with
recognizing the network impact of a lot of these things.
They have access to the information from the movement of
trains across our network to look for alternatives and
hopefully give an idea of potential estimates on how long that
may last, and other alternatives. But you are--it really comes
down to the technology enabling people to better respond, in
answer to the question.
Dr. Babin. And all good to know. So what can Congress, and
specifically this committee, do to help railroad industries to
fight trespassing and suicides as well?
Mr. Morris. Well, another great question. Trespassing is,
of course, a big concern, and I think you have hit on one of
the, I won't say hidden facts, but I don't know that we really
understand the true scope of the suicide issue with
trespassing, because it is likely rather underreported.
So the FRA has already--I know their work with Volpe, Dr.
Gabree has come in, and worked with not only industry but
Operation Lifesaver and others to help us better understand as
we work to address trespassing and some of these other issues
of safety to make sure we understand the impact that may have
on suicide and that we are not doing anything to increase the
problem.
So I think education not just for us but for the
communities is a big deal and a big help. I would say--and as
we put in the written statement--Operation Lifesaver is a
crucial ally to the railroads and to Government in how we work
some of these issues. So the recommendation about increasing
their funding, I think that is something where you can put in a
little and get a lot.
Dr. Babin. Thank you so very much. And my time has expired
so I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Lipinski. The Chair will now recognize Mr. Malinowski
for 5 minutes.
Mr. Malinowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to build on
some of the questions that Chairman DeFazio began with, and I
want to start with you, Mr. Alexy.
Would you acknowledge--and let me just make this very
basic--would you acknowledge that there is a relationship
between the length of a train and how long people are going to
be waiting at a railroad crossing?
Mr. Alexy. Unfortunately, we don't have any data to support
that. We know that the blocked crossings happen, but the
information that comes with any blocked crossing reports is----
Mr. Malinowski. I'm sorry, I'm a little confused. This
seems to be like first-grade arithmetic here. The longer the
train, the longer people are going to be waiting for that train
to clear a crossing. Is that not correct?
Mr. Alexy. That--as far as if that train is moving, yes, it
will take longer for that train to clear a crossing.
Mr. Malinowski. Thank you. And this would include first
responders who may be stuck waiting 3, 5, 10 minutes,
depending, again, on the length of the train. Is that not
correct?
Mr. Alexy. That is correct.
Mr. Malinowski. And the longer the train, if it has to stop
for whatever reason, the greater the chance that it will be
blocking a crossing, especially in a populated area where there
are more crossings.
Mr. Alexy. That is correct.
Mr. Malinowski. And yet it is the position of the FRA that
decisions about the lengths of trains should be left entirely
to the industry. Is that still your position, that you hope
that they take safety into account but that there should be no
regulations here on a national level?
Mr. Alexy. Yes, I believe that the railroads need to
identify their--you know, through their understanding of their
operations, make those decisions.
Mr. Malinowski. And you believe that the railroads, that
the freight railway industry will make those decisions with
safety as their primary consideration, even given the strong
economic incentives that they face to build longer and longer
trains?
Mr. Alexy. I believe that----
Mr. Malinowski. You trust them to do that?
Mr. Alexy. Yes, I believe that there are new rulemakings
coming out for risk reduction and systems safety, and the
railroads are going to be required to look at the risk
associated with the train lengths. So they are----
Mr. Malinowski. They will be required to look at the risk,
but they get to make the decision however they want. As long as
they have told you they have looked at the risk, you will be
satisfied. Is that what you are saying?
Mr. Alexy. They are going to have to adjust their
operations to address that risk that has been identified.
Mr. Malinowski. And what about crew size? We are seeing
pressure on the industry to cut crew size in some cases to one
crewmember per train. Imagine a 3-mile-long train with one
crewmember. I had an exchange with Mr. Batory on this issue. I
asked him if such a train were stopped because of an accident,
how long would it take the single crewmember to walk from the
front to the back of the train, and he memorably replied to me,
well, maybe a couple of hours, but it depends on whether he is
a good walker or not. Got to say that didn't build my
confidence.
Don't you--we heard from Mr. O'Shea about the importance of
cutting trains under those circumstances. Don't you think
having a second crewmember might be helpful in terms of very
rapidly cutting a train so that first responders and others can
get through?
Mr. Alexy. That--that is a good question. The--when you
look at--not necessarily. I would say that the time it takes to
cut a train is considerable, and given the data that we have on
the time that crossings are blocked, you would not--you may
even exacerbate the problem by sending someone back there and
do all the things they have to to secure the train that you are
cutting away from.
So it could create more problems in the long run.
Mr. Malinowski. That makes very little sense to me. It
would seem that having more than one crew person would make it
easier to perform those kinds of functions.
Mr. Morris, if I could ask you, we saw an industry white
paper recently that stated that one of the reasons blocked
crossings occur is when trains are being held to change
operating crews in order to prevent hours-of-service
violations. And I was curious, with the implementation of
Precision Scheduled Railroading, in which railroad schedulers'
schedules are much more precise, how can it be that operating
crews would be scheduled to time out just as they arrive at a
crossing? Wouldn't you be able to avoid that?
Mr. Morris. And that is a great question, Congressman. I
think one answer is that Norfolk Southern has about 24,000
grade crossings just ourselves. So that is an average of more
than one crossing per mile. So the sheer number of crossings
presents a little bit of a challenge, and that is another great
point that you made in terms of the scheduled railroading. We
hear a lot kind of about downsides; I would think that is one
improvement of knowing where people are supposed to be, when
they need to be there, what they're going to do. That is why it
would be helpful as we get more information to look at the
baseline impacts.
Mr. Malinowski. Thank you, I yield back.
Mr. Lipinski. The Chair will now recognize Mr. LaMalfa for
5 minutes.
Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, panelists,
for being here today. I am going to direct my questions to Mr.
Morris and Mr. Alexy mostly here, so I--you know, we all, I
suppose, in a way struggle with the at-grade crossings and some
of the challenges that they provide, but also the flexibility
they allow. So, you know, what I hear about in--so in northern
California areas, is that especially private crossings, at-
grade crossings, that railroads like to perhaps close them down
so they don't have the headache of a safety issue or whatever.
And I think that the more we close down at-grade crossings,
whether they're private crossings that go into a processing
plant or a family farm or just a home or whatever, it makes it
harder on somebody for not having those availability. And if
you were to close more at-grade crossings just in town, that
means you now have to go a different route just to get over. I
don't think there is enough money in the world to build split
crossings to accommodate everything.
So, you know, I know there is a tension here in figuring
that out. But, Mr. Morris, what do you see as the best
strategy, I think, to accommodate the need for them but also
achieve a higher safety factor?
And then, what is it on the education side? Do we just need
smarter people that know how to use railroad crossings and take
the normal warnings of looking both directions and things like
that? I mean, as I look at these, and we've had the issues,
again, in my district, some of them have no-cross arms and all
the other mechanisms, and those are probably a gazillion
dollars to put in. So is there a way to put a simpler--just
maybe a simple red light that would be activated at a private
crossing or small crossing without the high expense?
What can we do to--in order to keep more at-grade crossings
in rural areas, not have them eliminated for convenience or for
less lawsuits or whatever, but still achieve a safety factor
that would be maybe more acceptable than what this committee
has talked about today?
Mr. Morris. That's another great question, Congressman. I--
one of the recommendations that we have made, and we will
address it--kind of engineering and education. From an
education standpoint, one of the recommendations that we made
is that this committee and others should really encourage the
Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the FMCSA, to
evaluate their current driver education programs for commercial
drivers to see, you know, how effective they are.
And the second part of that recommendation would be to then
take the lessons learned from, you know, their evaluation and
move that over to encourage the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration to encourage States to incorporate more grade
crossing safety training in their driver education programs. I
mean, simple things of stop, look, listen. The meaning of
crossbuck signs to make sure people understand it.
I know when I'm driving with my children, it is kind of--
that is one thing that you would do, is just point out to them
what the proper behavior is.
Mr. LaMalfa. I am sorry, I am limited on time here. So is
there a push by railroads to close more and more at-grade
crossings, or do they try to maintain? Because, again, in rural
areas, the more you close, the farther they have to go to get
around them. When you have a train blocking a crossing, and in
my town, it's like, OK, you just turn around and you go back
up--sometimes it is a dirt road, but you go up a mile and then
you find a way to cross. I mean, you kind of have to know that
that is part of commerce too.
So, again, what is the balance on closing them and dealing
with stopped trains in rural areas?
Mr. Morris. Well, sir, the safest grade crossing is a
closed grade crossing. It's to limit the interaction. What we
try to do, and in keeping with the recommendation that the
closure incentive be increased from $7,500 to $100,000, was
really a reflection of the work that we try to do. When we go
in a community, we are trying to give answers and options on--
so it is not just close a crossing; it is maybe there are--it
is a redundant crossing, and by a little bit of roadway work,
we can close that crossing and route traffic to another
crossing, then create one crossing that won't be occupied
unnecessarily.
So it is a match, and it is a whole lot easier for us to go
in and say, take our $100,000, and for that to be turned into
$200,000. There is a lot larger impact than that $100,000 that
we give just going up to $107,500. So that is linked to that
increasing that contribution.
Mr. LaMalfa. Yes, OK. Well, 5 minutes flies by here, but
just in a lot of cases closing crossings is an unacceptable
option to and would be really detrimental to rural areas and
rural processing plants and things like that. So I just--I
don't want to see an overreaction because, you know, people
can't figure it out.
So thank you, I yield back.
Mr. Carson [presiding]. Mrs. Napolitano.
Mrs. Napolitano. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Christoffels,
the public agencies needing cooperation of private freight
railroads, what are the chances of working with the private
railroads when trying to construct a grade separation and
discuss the bureaucratic problems, delays that end up costing
the taxpayer and associated problems?
Mr. Christoffels. Thank you for the question. Obviously, we
have had almost 20 years working with railroads on trying to
improve their crossings. And yes, sometimes getting their
attention on a taxpayer-funded project, to get them to respond
in a timely manner, has been challenging. We are not
necessarily their highest priority. Obviously, moving freight
is their number one goal. And we are considered at many times
an inconvenience to them as we try to move forward on these
grade separation projects.
We have had several instances where we have had major delay
claims from our contractors because the railroad couldn't
respond in a timely manner to some of our construction
projects, costing perhaps millions of dollars at times.
I would also like to talk a little bit about their
contribution. Right now, the railroads, by Federal statute, are
required to contribute 5 percent to a typical grade separation
project. Just so you know, in the State of California that is
10 percent if there are no Federal funds. We have deliberately
defederalized projects in order to increase the railroad's
contribution in some of these projects.
But what is misunderstood about that statute is the
railroad can still charge us for their work on the project, for
example, if they have a flagman or they have a rail crew that
will be part of the construction activity. The net
contribution, for example, on our $1.8 billion program has been
less than 2 percent by the private sector, and in many cases it
is actually a negative because by the time I paid them for
their crew activity or other services they provided in
conjunction with the building of these projects, and then I
look at what they were required to contribute, we have actually
participated more in funding them than they have in us in these
projects. And I think that is something that this subcommittee
and Congress in general should take a look at. We are
mitigating impacts by the private sector. They are for-profit
businesses, and we need to take a hard look at times at what
kind of contribution we should get from these entities in
mitigating the impacts to our local communities.
Mrs. Napolitano. How long has it been since this--the 5
percent?
Mr. Christoffels. Pardon me?
Mrs. Napolitano. How long have the railroads----
Mr. Christoffels. The 5 percent has been in statute for a
long time, and it has not increased.
Mrs. Napolitano. We will be working to improve the section
130 program. What role does FRA and the Federal Government play
in regulating grade crossings in their related projects? And
can policy or Federal regulations be improved for addressing
grade crossings' safety and related projects, and what are the
changes for improvement that you recommend?
Mr. Christoffels. Well, I think a lot of my fellow
panelists have spoken about what might they have done on the
FRA to improve crossing safety. Our experience has been
relatively positive. We do have some quiet zones which we have
worked very closely with FRA on in implementing them for the
communities once these improvements are put in place.
But, you know, one of the big issues for us as well is the
blocked crossings. There was the discussion earlier about a 3-
mile train. You can imagine in a community like ours, that's
six crossings that would be simultaneously obstructed by a 3-
mile train. And what you get and what you have to understand is
that in addition to crew changes, they're looking for passing
sidings, looking for a clearance track, and when their passing
tracks were designed for trains that were only one-half mile in
length, the rest of that train has to sit somewhere, and where
it sits, of course, is on active crossings.
And so as the train length and train volume increases, we
see more and more of our crossings getting blocked as they're
waiting for that passing opportunity on their overcrowded
system. And even technology won't correct that. So I just
wanted to share that with you that we've seen that, and I think
FRA needs to take a hard look as train length is increasing,
what that will mean on especially in an urbanized environment
where you have very close proximity of your crossings. There
are no opportunities for a motorist to veer off onto a
different street to get by this particular train.
Mrs. Napolitano. Thank you, Mr. Christoffels.
Mr. Alexy, in December 2019, last year, the FRA pointed out
that there are no Federal laws or regulations pertaining to
blocked passage. Why is that?
Mr. Alexy. I can't speak to why there is not a regulation.
There is a regulation about if the unnecessary closure of a
crossing with the signals being activated, so there is that. If
there are switching operations that are causing the signal to--
or the grade crossing to close and unnecessarily block that
crossing. But I can't speak to as to why there is not a
regulation about occupying a crossing.
Mrs. Napolitano. Would you agree that it's time for a
change?
Mr. Alexy. I think that is something that we should
certainly look into. I think it's a difficult thing to
regulate. I think there are a variety of issues that need to be
taken into account. There are regulations that the railroads
already have to adhere to, and prohibiting the blockage of a
crossing may then contradict compliance with those other
regulations, and also this is a potentially difficult
regulation to enforce.
Mrs. Napolitano. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I will submit
questions for the record.
Mr. Carson. Mr. Balderson.
Mr. Balderson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, panel,
for being here.
Mr. Alexy, for the first question, the FRA recently awarded
funding to four law enforcement agencies to address railroad
trespassing enforcement. Your findings show a significant
reduction in trespassing incidents in these four local
jurisdictions. How do you think these funds helped reduce
railroad trespassing and does the FRA plan to expand this
program so more law enforcement agencies can crack down on
trespassing incidents and improve safety?
Mr. Alexy. So thank you for that question. Yes, we have
seen the benefit of having these law enforcement liaisons that
work with law enforcement and to train them, to spend time out
there educating the public, working with judges for the
prosecution of violations under--to make the local law
enforcement understand how important it is that they do enforce
the local trespassing rules.
So yes, it has been very, very helpful, and we will expand
it as we are currently doing that. We have a grant that is out
and we are looking at the applications that are coming in. So
we hope to expand this to as great an extent as we can.
Mr. Balderson. All right. Thank you very much.
Mr. Morris, thank you for being here this morning, and I
know that you have discussed this a little bit this morning,
but I just want to get into it a little bit deeper because we
are dealing with Ohio, and that is my home State. But in your
testimony you discussed Norfolk Southern's partnership with the
Waze navigation app. I see from your testimony that Toledo,
Ohio, is one of the pilot projects targeted. While I don't
represent Toledo, I am interested in how we can expand this
technology across the Buckeye State.
Can you discuss how this program has been successful and
does Norfolk Southern have plans to expand it to other parts of
its network?
Mr. Morris. Yes, sir. Happy to discuss it. Our pilot
project really started in March of 2019, and the idea was to
utilize the advertising aspect, the targeted advertising aspect
of Waze. So Toledo was one of the areas. There were seven
crossings that we wanted to target. And what we do is set up a
geofence around the area that we would like to target. When a
motorist uses the app and they are inside of that geofence, you
get an advertisement that pops up, an awareness message from
the railroad, and that allows us to reach not only those that
may go over the crossing but those that are generally in that
area.
It only pops up when the vehicles stop. So we can kind of
sidestep any issue or thoughts about distraction. We are
planning to continue the campaign because we found great
success in those areas.
The idea is to kind of take that total market saturation,
expand it not just in the number of locations that we're
targeting, but also taking the message and potentially, I guess
you would say, specializing the message for the area or for
what we are finding in that specific area, and then linking in
on the back end for those who want to save it for later or
click through, you know, more indepth messaging about Norfolk
Southern, about grade crossing and trespassing awareness, and
really link that in to our overall grade crossing awareness
campaign. And that would match with the efforts of our
operation awareness and response train.
As we go around to communities, we have added a grade
crossing safety component to that to go along with the
education that we provide for first responders for hazmat and
accident response and those issues.
Mr. Balderson. OK. Thank you very much for your answer, and
Mr. Chairman, I yield back my remaining time.
Mr. Carson. Gentleman yields back. Thank you.
Mr. Payne.
Mr. Payne. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Alexy, I wish--you
know, we are kind of talking in hypotheticals pretty much for
this discussion. But I wish I was still speaking in a
hypothetical, but, you know, a frequent cause of fatalities at
grade crossings is a driver trying to make it across a railroad
crossing before an oncoming train arrives. Sadly, there were
two fatalities just last month in New Jersey when a train hit a
car in a railroad crossing. It is unclear if the driver was
trying to cross while the train was coming, oncoming, or if
there were other circumstances.
However, I believe the FRA should be giving States all
necessary resources to enhance grade crossing safety to
minimize fatalities.
Can you elaborate on what assistance the FRA is offering to
help States prevent deaths for motorists entering grade
crossings in the path of oncoming trains?
Mr. Alexy. Well, we have grade crossing inspectors across
the entire country. And we work closely with communities. You
know, we go out and we make sure, one, that everything is
functioning as it is supposed to at a crossing. And we do a lot
of outreach. But as far as what we're giving to States in
particular, as far as the Office of Safety, which is my office,
I am not familiar with anything in particular other than what
we do as far as our enforcement and outreach efforts.
Mr. Payne. So the only resources are in outreach, and is
that correct?
Mr. Alexy. I think there is probably more. There are
additional resources in our grant program that if localities
want to apply for CRISI grants or those types of grants, that
they certainly can.
So FRA in general does.
Mr. Payne. And those are readily made available? Do
communities know of these grants?
Mr. Alexy. Yes, they are publicly--they are announced and
they are out there.
Mr. Payne. OK. All right. Mr. Morris, a key component of
grade crossing safety is ensuring that grade crossings are not
blocked by oncoming trains for extended periods of time. What
is Norfolk Southern doing to reduce the risk of blocked grade
crossings and to improve grade crossing safety overall?
Mr. Morris. Another very good question, sir, and I can
understand the interest of everybody, and that is why we
appreciate being a part of this hearing. I think one of the
things that we continue to stress is just the partnership with
the communities that are out there.
With the emergency notification system coming in, we get--
you know, when we get a report, it is routing that through to
the appropriate people to understand what is happening and
understand why, and then evaluating to see if there are
repeated instances. So I think there is a difference in
handling on a case-by-case basis, a one-off versus something
that appears to be happening repeatedly are going to be handled
differently in evaluating, hey, what is--what is the proper
course of action here?
And as we have already indicated, sometimes it is an
engineering answer; sometimes it is an education answer about
where we can stage our trains; sometimes it is an education
answer with the community about specifically what is happening.
But really the feedback loop is the most important thing of
understanding, you know, hey, we understand it is an issue and
we are trying to get to the bottom of what is going on.
Mr. Payne. OK. Mr. Chair, I will yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. Carson. The gentleman yields back.
Mr. Pence.
Mr. Pence. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Indiana has over 3,800
miles of Class I railroad tracks, the majority operated by CSX
and Norfolk Southern Corporation. As the crossroads of America,
our rail industry is one of the busiest in the Nation, holding
true to our nickname as the crossroads of America, moving over
328 million tons of freight annually.
According to the 2018 Indiana State Freight Plan, our State
ranks ninth in the U.S. for railroad miles, yet that same year
we ranked sixth in the Nation for railroad crossings. As Mr.
Morris says in his written testimony, we are now number 5.
Safety is the major concern. The city of Rushville, in my
district, has a population of 6,000 people. When a freight
train stops at one of their main crossings, it splits the town
in half. Ambulances and firefighters could be rerouted,
threatening lives in case of emergency. Mr. O'Shea, as you
noted, 10 minutes could mean zero chance to save a life, as it
does in your community where my grandfather and grandmother
lived for many years.
In Muncie, Indiana, the Tillotson crossing splits a local
neighborhood from West View Elementary School, and you are not
going to believe this but maybe it can--I have received calls
from constituents and local officials in Muncie who have
witnessed children climbing under and around the train to get
to school. I am sure we can all agree that that is a major
safety concern.
Mr. Morris, we are grateful that Norfolk Southern vowed to
work with the Muncie, Indiana, transit system to address this
specific problem.
In addition, I am pleased that in Rushville, CSX joined a
task force with local officials to reduce stoppages and the
impact on their community. These are both great examples of
industry and Government working together to improve grade
crossing safety and minimizing avoidable stoppages.
Mr. Morris, I appreciate that you highlighted Indiana's
Local Trax Rail Overpass program, a public-private partnership
grant program created by Governor Holcomb in 2017 to enhance
railroad intersections with local roads.
Regardless of these ongoing efforts, my office--and I know
my colleague and fellow Hoosier, Representative Carson, our
offices are inundated with calls about problems that our
constituents encounter in rural communities.
Mr. Morris, in your testimony you agree there is more to be
done, stating the rail industry is not satisfied either. With
population size among the grant eligibility criteria, small
towns like Rushville will likely never qualify for Local Trax
or section 130 funding, like L.A. or Chicago.
Mr. Morris, do you see an opportunity for industry and
Government to develop a strategy like an operating procedure or
a set of standards to mitigate the impact on rural communities
that will not be awarded competitive grants because of their
size?
Mr. Morris. Thank you. Yes, sir, I do. I mentioned we have
about 24,000 grade crossings on Norfolk Southern. The fact that
I recognize Tillotson should, I think, tell you everything
about it. And that is a perfect example of we mentioned
engineering as one solution, education, and this is a great
example of education both inward and outward.
That was the situation where we were actually able to kind
of take that feedback, look at the operation, get a sense of
what was creating the issues, and by adjusting the locations of
pickups and set-outs of customer freight on two trains
operating in the area, adjusting some of the timing of some of
our more irregular local trains that were operating on less of
a scheduled time, we think that we have addressed that issue.
But I think that is a perfect example of where it goes to,
you know, some of these issues, really, they start to get very
complicated because it can create a cascading effect if you are
trying to fix it by pulling on the wrong lever. And that was a
perfect example of getting kind of the safety people, our
operating folks together and saying, hey, what gives? And you
should see that decrease. But perfect example of education
works both ways.
Mr. Pence. Thank you all for being here. Mr. Chairman, I
yield back.
Mr. Lipinski [presiding]. The Chair will now recognize Ms.
Norton for 5 minutes.
Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate this
hearing. Well, I have an interest in railroads and trespassing,
and the statistics that show that people are often killed by
walking the railroads. This is a kind of romantic notion of
walking on the railroad tracks. And I have some statistics, and
there is also the notion, of course, of taking a shortcut
across the railroad tracks. And so I am trying to find out what
we are doing about that. And I noted some data that surprised
me. Up to 500, 400, between 400 and 500 casualties, or I'm
sorry, fatalities, perhaps many more injuries than we know,
because only the casualties, I believe, are reported.
Now, I appreciate that the FRA has looked at the
statistics, done a lot of research and come up with some
notions like educating the public. I am more interested in one
of their ideas about law enforcement and policing and fines. I
recognize that would take some work, but when you have that
amount of--that number of fatalities, it seems to me it is
worth the work.
Now, I do note the interest therefore in warning signs and
medians and signage generally. Are there--I suppose this
question could go to Mr. Vercruysse, Mr. Christoffels, or
Alderman O'Shea, or all of you, are there any--what work is
being done that you know of and are there grade crossing
projects that may be ineligible for the Federal funding 130
program that you believe should be eligible under that program
to bring funding to it as a safety matter?
Mr. Vercruysse. Thank you very much. I am happy to answer
the question and address trespassing more from the State
funding perspective and what we are doing, and maybe that could
serve as guidance to--at the Federal level and what we have
been discussing with the FRA. In 2001, our State statutes were
changed so that we could fund pedestrian bridges, overpasses,
underpasses, and that was in direct response to a location
where we had blocked crossings and kids going through trains.
Ultimately, the first bridge project that we did construct
was at a location where a middle school was separated from a
whole community and the children have to walk 1\1/2\ to 2 miles
along an unimproved area. The seventh grader, she was killed at
this location and from there we started building bridges.
And that is when we started getting involved in what was
really trespassing mitigation. More recently in the last--I
would say in the last 6 months, we have been looking at our
State statutes on how we can address trespassing mitigation
especially with the findings by the FRA that 75 percent of the
incidents happen within 1,000 feet of a crossing. How do we
expand that definition of the crossing, or at least whatever we
are working on--trying to take care of two factors?
So as part of our State statute in review of what we are
trying to do is to allow us to help fund those projects which
might be fencing. It may be more bridges that we have done in
the past. We know how to do those things. I think the bigger
challenge is how do we make it for law enforcement so on their
normal patrols and their normal day-to-day operations that we
integrate it? How do we use technology whether it is radar
systems or other detection modes for trespassers going off of
the crossing, and then provide that information to law
enforcement in a usable way?
We have worked with programs before, actually one that was
funded federally, the PEERS Program, the Public Education and
Enforcement Research Study, and I believe some of these
programs after that have been just, you know, part
continuation. Those did show a benefit but that involved--
overtime, that involved trying to, you know, make sure you have
those resources always available. So our question is using
technology today, what can we get to the police departments and
how can they address it in a more immediate fashion? Thank you.
Ms. Norton. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I think this
is a matter that has received too little attention from the
Congress, for these fatalities demand our attention. Thank you
very much.
Mr. Lipinski. Thank you. Now, the Chair will now recognize
Mr. Bost for 5 minutes.
Mr. Bost. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Just so you know, I served
as a professional firefighter, as a union firefighter for many
years, and I was trained at one of the best schools in the
Nation, the Illinois Firefighters Academy. It is second best in
the Nation only to New York. Now, part of that training and let
me tell you--look at me. It was a long time ago.
The training dealing with hazmat spills whether it was
train or whether it was other transport, and/or dealing with
fires on those types of situations was a pretty intense
training. And then--and I'm not joking about this. This is
actually some of the training. Then we had what was known as
the ``cop'' test.
We would come with the firetruck, OK? You hit one-eighth
mile off. You get your binoculars out and if you think you'd
had a hazmat spill, if the cops were down, don't go in. That
really was part of it back then. Now, things have changed since
then on how training goes, but that being said we are trained
on a lot of things. And just recently we had a train derailment
right in my district and there was a fire, and fortunately no
lives were lost.
And no property was destroyed except for the damage to the
train that occurred there. That being said, Mr. Morris, how are
you working--because I was in a fire department that we had
professional training because we were paid by the city. The
city could afford that. We could afford to be sent to the best
training. How are you working with rural area first responders
on trying to make sure that they are trained to the level they
are that can assist to be the responders they need to be?
Mr. Morris. It is a very important issue and Norfolk
Southern's approach has been to as much as possible take the
training to the departments. And that is the Operation
Awareness and Response training that I mentioned, and the stops
across our system. We have an 18-stop tour scheduled for 2020.
This is something we have done for years. We pick areas
across the system. We let people know that we are coming and
then that training is provided free of charge to first
responders to let them know what they need to know when it
comes to dealing with hazmat, and to let them know resources
that are out there.
The industry has put a lot in developing technology
resources, like the AskRail app that is out there from the
railroad industry and available for our first responders to
where you can actually log in, and at the click of a button get
a better understanding of what is in the consist. And not only
that but it routes you out to some of the emergency response
guidelines, such as your clear distances and evacuation or
isolation distances to let you know more about that particular
commodity and the dangers associated.
Beyond that, we fund scholarships. Again, on the industry
level to our SERTC Program out in Pueblo, Colorado, that is run
in collaboration with TTCI to give an even more indepth
training where people leave that training HAZWOPER certified.
So I think the industry would agree that it is very important
for our first responders to have at least some familiarity with
the different commodities that we're moving and how to
appropriately respond in an incident.
Mr. Bost. I am glad you mentioned the app and I am glad
technology is being dropped in there because whenever I was
firefighting and I was responding you had a book in the glove
compartment. And then you had to go with a number, and the
description and find it. And it had all that information, but
today, the technology a firefighter can en route, hopefully, be
able to get the information.
So the other question I have here and I have just got a
short period of time, but so when you say you notify the
communities, you just go down your existing rail and say OK,
this is a community that hasn't been trained yet. Boom. That is
when we are going to--and then you reach out to the local law
enforcement and/or first responders, or how is that done?
Mr. Morris. We have hazmat officers located around our
system and hazmat officers and environmental operations
officers that, you know, really a lot of them are former first
responders, and they have partnerships and relationships with
the communities. It is on our web--it is also a link to it from
our website.
I don't think it is on the actual Norfolk Southern. It is a
separate website that you can get to from there that will allow
you to get the information. And I believe it is joinnsoar.com.
And that is in the written testimony as well. So people can go
to that and get more information about where those events are
and when they are coming.
Mr. Bost. All right. Thank you very much. With that, Mr.
Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Lipinski. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Carson for 5
minutes.
Mr. Carson. Thank you, Chair. Mr. Morris, in your testimony
you ask for increased Federal funding for the section 130
program. How has your organization invested in improving grade
crossing safety and how does fiscal year 2020 projected
spending compare to previous years?
Mr. Morris. Another very important topic which is section
130. I think it is at $245 million for 2020 and our
recommendation that it be maintained at that if not increased
as we move into the future. It is important to realize that we
are not just asking for this money and not investing in
anything ourselves. The railroad industry spent hundreds of
millions of dollars a year on our infrastructure maintenance as
it directly connected to grade crossings.
Norfolk Southern, itself, spends $30 to $40 million a year
maintaining warning devices and we are reimbursed under $2
million for that work. So it is an ongoing effort. I think when
we look to section 130, what we are looking at for those
projects are projects that can have an outsized influence.
You know, these larger grade separation projects where we
think we can solve a lot of issues in collaboration with
localities and others to really have a larger impact. So that
money is not for little things. The, you know, $245 million or
more that goes into that, I think you can see from the other
witnesses there is an outsized impact of what goes into that.
Mr. Carson. Thank you, sir. Mr. Vercruysse, your testimony
states that four-quadrant gates should be the goal of efforts
to install, renew and significantly change crossing. What
safety benefits do four-quad gates offer railroads and
communities? And do barriers exist to installing these gates?
Mr. Vercruysse. Thank you, very much. Four-quadrant gates,
we have 178 locations in the State of Illinois and primarily we
have an accident figure, where approximately 25 percent of
people go around the gates. The four-quadrant gates will seal
off the entire crossing so that that person or motorist cannot
go around the gates.
And we have gone farther in use of vehicle detection in the
crossing and along our corridor from Chicago to St. Louis.
Those vehicle loops also have additional services. So this
vehicle detection will actually communicate back to the train
if we have an obstruction, say a farm vehicle, a truck or some
other implement on the crossing.
So there we can provide safety in terms of avoiding
derailments. Our passenger trains, those passengers on the
train did not go around the gate. We need to find a way to
address all of their concerns. But four-quadrant gates to us
provide the best available technology that solves about--we see
25 percent of the accidents. And if we were not to look at
that, we have not looked at all of our engineering solutions.
And as such we found a great benefit in accident reduction
through that area.
Mr. Carson. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Chair. I yield back.
Mr. Lipinski. Thank you, Mr. Carson. I now yield 5 minutes
to Mr. Davis.
Mr. Davis. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I appreciate the
opportunity. I apologize I missed opening testimony and some of
the other questions. So I am going to keep my questions to more
of a local-level issue and Mr. Vercruysse, good to see you
again. Thank you for being here. I have heard from one of my
good friends, Mayor Chris Koos of Normal. Normal, Illinois, for
those of you who have not been there. It is issues regarding
rail blockings.
I understand his office has been in close communications
with the rail company which really is key to addressing these
local-level concerns. And as we draft the next surface
transportation bill, what can we as legislators provide you in
Illinois to make sure our State is the safest in the country
when it comes to rail crossings?
Mr. Vercruysse. Thank you very much and good to see you
too. With the rail crossings, I think in terms of blocked
crossings we would like to see a plan in place as far as when
operation changes occur, how are these to be addressed. If
there is a continuous need to address the blocked crossings,
then are we looking to infrastructure plans and how do we fund
those plans?
How do we get all of the parties together and formulate
what is a coordinated effort before it happens? That would be a
primary goal. After that, expanding past the normal area, loss
of shunt issues and trying to go to the next development of
Positive Train Control, right now we still have track circuits
that were derived from the late 1800s.
So that is the underlying technology that is used, and then
obviously through our great use of computing power we have been
able to augment that, but we still are relying on track
circuits. So under a new Federal legislative initiative, I
think it would be nice to see help and have Positive Train
Control addressing the grade crossings.
Mr. Davis. OK. Well, I appreciate your viewpoint on that
and you mention the short shunt issue and the impact on rail
safety. I know this is also an issue that has been raised in
connection with Amtrak's Illini route and how it may have
affected their on-time performance. The Illini route services
my constituents in Champaign-Urbana, and can you speak to your
efforts with the railways IDOT and Amtrak to address this issue
so that our commuter trains arrive safely, but also on time?
Mr. Vercruysse. Yeah. Thank you. There has been a great
effort in the last 2 years with the railroads, all of the major
parties. Yesterday I was at a meeting of the loss of shunt
committee which had pretty much the ``who's who'' of railroad
signaling and warning devices present to help address the
concerns.
And as a result there have been modifications to warning
systems, settings. There have been software modifications but
yet there are the speed restrictions that you have discussed
that ultimately affect or impact what the commuter time may
take. But at this point we are working towards the next product
which is something that has been utilized in Europe for quite
some time and is to help assist that track circuit that I
discussed with the old signal technology.
We just signed an agreement to help fund that portion. In
addition, the railroads have expended a great deal of
resources. Amtrak is working towards a solution as is the
Illinois Department of Transportation. So this project, we
anticipate, will be 1 year to 2 years, but ultimately, we still
believe the direction would be to move to that next level of
radio-based or wireless detection.
Mr. Davis. So the implementation of PTC technology as we
see it nationwide probably isn't going to affect the issue that
you think we may be having on the Illini route?
Mr. Vercruysse. Correct. It does not address the at-grade
crossings and my understanding it doesn't solve the loss of
shunt concern.
Mr. Davis. OK. Well, I look forward to continuing to work
with you and the commission, and also our partners in the rail
industry, Amtrak and IDOT too, to move forward on both of these
issues. Thank you for your time, and thank you to all of the
witnesses.
I yield back, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Lipinski. Thank you, the Chair now recognizes Mr.
Garcia for 5 minutes.
Mr. Garcia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and to all of the
witnesses who came this morning, I apologize I couldn't be here
for all of your statements. I had a bill up in a neighboring
committee. But I am glad to see not one but two witnesses from
Illinois here. Thank you, Alderman O'Shea and Administrator
Vercruysse. And of course it makes sense that we have great
representation from the Chicago area at today's hearing.
Chicago is America's transportation hub with over 7,400
miles of railroad tracks and thousands of rail crossings. We
are quite familiar with rail and all of the positive and
negatives that come with it. Safety, of course, must be our top
priority. So I am glad we are focused on that today. One area
of safety I think we often overlook, however, is the long-term
dangers of communities in close proximity or immediate
adjacency to heavily industrialized areas or major rail
infrastructure.
More often than that it is working-class communities and
communities of color that run along railroad tracks. These are
areas that need more infrastructure investment right where I
live. In the district I represent we have trains and tracks
running right through our neighborhoods by our schools. It is
part of life.
You hear the trains rumble through at all hours of the day
and night, and of course we are all too familiar with blocked
crossings. What we don't talk about enough are the
environmental justice implications of blocked crossings. Those
of us who don't live near railroad tracks may not see this but
I see it all the time in my district.
A few weeks ago, the Chicago rep from CSX, Tom Livingston,
gave me a tour of CREATE, a landmark public-private partnership
to clear up congestion in Chicago. And my key takeaway is when
we invest and bring Government and the public sector together,
we can provide real solutions. But there is still so much more
we can do.
On the Northwest Side we get backups along Belmont between
Pulaski and Kedzie Avenue. And the Southwest Side by my home we
have got issues like the ones we see on Pulaski and 33rd
Street. When blocked trains back up traffic, it is not just a
nuisance or congestion. It is a health and safety issue as
well. Idling trucks from the local freight and logistics
operation lead to heavy tractor-trailers idling right outside
of schools and right through neighborhoods.
There are plumes of smoke at times and the constant smell
of thick, diesel fumes. There are kids that walk all along
these congested truck routes. My question is what happens to
the families and the kids for whom this is their everyday? This
is simply the air they breathe day in and day out. What about
their safety?
So, Mr. Christoffels, in your testimony you shared a lot
about the success of the Alameda Corridor Project. Can you talk
about the added air quality and environmental benefit you have
achieved by successfully completing grade separation projects?
Mr. Christoffels. Yes, thank you for the question. I stated
earlier in my testimony the crossings that we have eliminated
through grade separation has reduced approximately 2,000
vehicle-hours of delay per day. So that's--again, that's 2,000
vehicles sitting there, idling in these neighborhoods that you
were just alluding to.
That is pollution that these residents and children are not
being subjected to. The same thing also--in providing these
crossings we are moving the freight through their communities
as opposed to allowing those trains to sit, and stall and idle,
which is also improving the air quality for those residents
living in the area.
And of course there is beyond just the environmental; it is
a safety issue. We now have the ability to get students to
their classrooms via these underpasses where they will not be
subjected to standing at a crossing, and being in close
proximity to the rail engines as they are traveling through
their communities.
Mr. Garcia. Thank you, and do you believe that more Federal
funding for these grade separation projects and a dedicated
funding stream would help?
Mr. Christoffels. Absolutely. Yes.
Mr. Garcia. Excellent. Now, I want to turn to Alderman
O'Shea and maybe, perhaps if time allows, back to Mr.
Christoffels. Can you speak to some of the same concerns about
blocked crossings and the resulting air quality issues that can
arise from idling trucks and diverted traffic, because in
Chicago the first person they call is the local alderman, as
you know too well, Alderman O'Shea? And do you believe that the
Federal Government could provide a more dedicated funding
stream to build grade separated crossings?
Mr. O'Shea. Thank you for the question. Something I didn't
talk about in my testimony but also is a problem in communities
throughout the country, and I have certainly seen it, when
trains are stopped, maybe not necessarily blocking a crossing,
but stopped because the motor facility or the yard they are
headed to is crowded, they will sit in my community for hours
at a time with the locomotive running.
And that is a tremendous amount of pollution that the
residents in that area will see. And like your neighborhood
that you represent, the neighborhood I represent, I remember
when the Surface Transportation Board came out. They couldn't
believe the proximity from the residential homes to the rail
lines.
I mean, literally in my community there are homes 60 feet
from the rail line. And when you have 5,000-foot-long trains
with a locomotive running, idling for, in some cases, hours at
a time, that is a tremendous amount of pollution being released
in the air which is really bad for a community.
So although my--the problems I have seen in my community
are a little different, that most certainly is a real problem.
We have got to keep these trains moving. I think any community
would understand that we need freight rail traffic. This is
commerce, but we need the trains to move. And when they stop,
whether it is blocking a crossing which is dangerous to both
pedestrians, but also dangerous and problematic, and quality of
life issues for motorists and community residents, stopped
trains that are idling is also a very serious issue as far as
it pertains to pollution.
So I would welcome any thoughts, any ideas to try to
resolve some of these issues as it affects my neighborhood on
the Southwest Side of Chicago.
Mr. Garcia. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman for
your indulgence. I yield back.
Mr. Lipinski. Thank you, Mr. Garcia. The Chair now
recognizes Ms. Wilson for 5 minutes.
Ms. Wilson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Preventing grade
crossing collisions and fatalities is a major challenge in
Florida where passenger and freight railroad tracks stretch
across the State. I have watched several troubling videos of
vehicles narrowly escaping Brightline trains in my district.
While these incidents did not result in fatalities or
injuries, so many others have. FRA data and those reports
indicate that since 2017, at least 40 Brightline collisions
have resulted in fatalities. It is absolutely incredible and we
have never experienced anything like this before in the
railroad industry.
Given this deadly increase, I urge FRA to review these
incidents and issue recommendations. I encouraged Brightline to
attend this hearing. They declined but said they would include
a statement for the record, because we need to find new
effective solutions to this problem because whatever everyone
has been doing up to this point is simply not working.
I have a few questions. Mr. Alexy, the rail line in
Florida, itself, has been around for years as part of the
Florida East Coast Railway. But Brightline began operating in
2017 and has dramatically expanded service. In the past, slower
freight trains used the line, but Brightline now runs up to 20
trains per day operating at an average speed of 80 miles per
hour.
Since Brightline launched 2 years ago, on average more than
one person a month has been killed on the tracks in a car, on a
bike or on foot. An analysis by the Associated Press found that
this was the worst death rate per mile of any of the Nation's
railroads. And as of today more than 40 lives have been lost.
How is the FRA working with Brightline and local authorities to
reduce incidents and fatalities?
Mr. Alexy. Thank you. Thank you for the question. We are
well aware of the issues down there and it is important to us.
We have been working with Brightline from the beginning, from
the inception of the project, and to ensure that their
operations one, are in compliance.
We have also worked with them for outreach reasons to reach
out to others--to the communities along that route to
understand the differences in the operations that you point
out, that these are much faster trains. And the time that they
catch up with you is much shorter. So there is less time, but
the important thing is to get people to--whatever we can do to
get them to stop trespassing.
That is an important element of this and that outreach is
vital, and important to that. We also have--again, I have
spoken about it before about the grants that are available to
do any type of grade crossing upgrades or improvements and the
like, and also trespass prevention as well for local
communities.
Ms. Wilson. Have you given any safety recommendations to
Brightline itself and have they been implemented,
recommendations that the company can do to stop some of these
deaths?
Mr. Alexy. Well, we have stressed the importance of
outreach and working with the communities----
Ms. Wilson. We have done outreach. We have done outreach.
We have--in fact, I taped a commercial myself to--for the
community and for people to understand the difference in the
speed of the trains. But that has not worked.
Mr. Alexy. We have--you know what? I will say that we have
done a lot of enforcement. We have been down there making sure
that one, their gates and lights, and their crossing equipment
is working right, and their operations are all in compliance.
And generally their compliance record is very good. And we
continue to keep a very close eye on them.
Ms. Wilson. Have you spoken with them at all about having
law enforcement or private security companies stationed at the
crossings when the trains are scheduled to come along the
tracks?
Mr. Alexy. I have not. I can check on that to find out if
we have had those conversations. I know the president of
Brightline was up meeting with our Deputy Administrator to talk
about different strategies they have implemented. I will have
to go back and doublecheck that to find out if that
conversation happened, but--and we can submit that.
Ms. Wilson. Ms. Maleh, thank you and your colleagues at
Operation Lifesaver for your work to promote rails safely and
save lives in Florida, and across this Nation. Can you
highlight Operation Lifesaver's work to reduce Brightline
related fatalities and the potential impact on increased
Federal funding? How would that help those efforts?
Ms. Maleh. Thank you very much for the question. We
recently participated in a safety blitz in Florida with
Brightline with our State coordinator there. And my colleague
Chantez Bailey who is here with me in the room did multiple
press conferences. They also ran a mobile van throughout the
State where the tracks run to share the importance of when you
see tracks, think train.
It is really the outreach and the education. I think a lot
of people don't realize how fast the train is moving. It is an
optical illusion or they are distracted and they don't stop, or
they are used to driving around a gate because trains never
come. It has moved slowly. So we are trying to change human
behavior which is a daily, as well as an hourly, project that
we undertake through our education efforts.
But we are also reaching back younger, to the younger ages,
to students in schools to work with school administrators to
get the word out through their school assemblies. We are
working with driver's education programs so that they learn the
signs, as my colleague to my left talked about, so that drivers
know what the signs mean and how to yield or stop at a
crossing.
So we do a multitude of trainings and education, and
outreach throughout the State of Florida as well as the other
States in the country. One of the things that is really--that
we are noticing is the selfies and photographers taking
pictures on the tracks.
So one of the outreaches that we did with Brightline was
educating photographers, amateur photographers and the
teenagers not to take photos on the tracks. So they had this
mobile selfie booth with rail safety messages near the
crossings as part of events so that they were part of a
community outreach festival.
Ms. Wilson. I yield back.
Mr. Lipinski. Thank you. We have been going for over 2
hours now. So at the risk of prolonging this, I want to see if
any of the witnesses had any short comment they want to add at
this time? All right. Thank you. And everyone else thanks you
too, probably. I want to thank all of you for your testimony
today.
The discussion has been very informative and helpful. You
know this is an issue where we need to figure out where we are
going to draw lines because no one--as I said in my opening
statement, our freight rail network is the envy of the world
and helps our country be--all of our businesses be more
efficient.
There are issues though that arise because of the vast
network of freight railroads and we need to figure out the
right place to make sure that communities are protected from
the negatives that do come from that. So I think all of the
testimony today has been very helpful as we move forward with
writing the reauthorization bill.
And we will continue to have discussions with all of you
and relevant stakeholders as we move forward in the next month
or two. So with that I want to ask unanimous consent that the
record of today's hearing remain open until such time as our
witnesses have provided answers to any questions that may be
submitted to them in writing.
And I ask unanimous consent that the record remain open for
15 days for any additional comments and information submitted
by Members or witnesses to be included in the record of today's
hearing. Without objection so ordered, and if no other Members
have anything to add, the subcommittee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 12:19 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

Submissions for the Record

----------

Prepared Statement of Hon. Peter A. DeFazio, a Representative in
Congress from the State of Oregon, and Chairman, Committee on
Transportation and Infrastructure
Thank you, Chairman Lipinski and Ranking Member Crawford, for
calling today's hearing to look at issues surrounding grade crossing
safety.
The last time this Committee held a hearing to examine grade
crossing issues was 15 years ago. A lot has changed since then. We all
now have cell phones, which is the number one contributor to distracted
driving. We rely on apps like Google Maps and Waze to find shortcuts to
help us get to our destinations faster. The Class I railroads have
implemented Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR), which includes
operating longer trains, closing yards, and demanding signalmen cover
more and more territory in order to cut labor expenses. All these
changes have an impact on safety at public grade crossings.
States and localities have tried to address some of the grade
crossing issues they face but have a hard time keeping up--often with
little financial support from the Federal Government or railroads.
While the railroads advocate for closing more grade crossings, these
projects often aren't realistic solutions in densely populated
communities that have been built around rail lines.
Grade crossing separation projects can increase capacity and free-
flowing movement for both trains and vehicles, while reducing vehicle-
train conflict and increasing safety. However, we'll hear from
witnesses today just how expensive these projects can be. With only
$245 million available nationwide this year for projects through the
Section 130 Railway-Highway Grade Crossing Program, many states
struggle to cover the costs of multi-million dollar projects. As a
result, we plan to provide more funding opportunities for these larger
grade crossing safety projects through rail safety grants in the Rail
Title of the Surface Reauthorization bill.
Another issue compounding the problems at grade crossings is the
growing length of freight trains. Though railroads don't make train
length publicly available, two Class I railroads provided information
to the Government Accountability Office that showed train length has
increased by 25 percent in just the last 10 years. I am very concerned
by this trend and suspect that train length will continue to grow with
the Class I railroads' implementation of Precision Scheduled
Railroading.
While increasing train lengths to over 3 miles long might provide a
cost-savings to the railroads, it has major impacts on the communities
these trains traverse, sometimes bisecting entire communities and
bringing traffic to a halt for hours or even days! And without sidings
long enough to hold such long trains, trains idle on tracks while
waiting to enter a yard, sometimes blocking crossings and creating
traffic jams.
We have heard from numerous state and local officials that long
trains and trains stopped on crossings have prolonged response times
for emergency responders and forced them to find alternative routes.
Thirty-five states and Washington, D.C. have laws in place allowing
them to issue a civil fine to a railroad when it blocks a crossing for
an extended amount of time. But in the last decade, the railroads have
challenged many of these state laws in court on the grounds that they
are pre-empted by federal law. However, there are no federal
regulations pertaining to trains blocking public grade crossing.
To make matters worse, FRA Administrator Ronald Batory told this
Committee last June that solutions to these problems should be
addressed at the local level leaving little incentive for railroads to
take community concerns seriously. States continue to try to address
persistent blocked crossings by working with railroad representatives,
but problems persist, and I continue to hear complaints from
constituents.
Today's panel includes witnesses with varied first-hand experiences
in dealing with grade crossings issues. I look forward to hearing their
suggestions on improving grade crossing safety, reducing blocked
crossings, and how best to engage railroads, local communities, and the
Federal Government in being cooperative partners on grade crossing
issues.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Sam Graves, a Representative in Congress
from the State of Missouri, and Ranking Member, Committee on
Transportation and Infrastructure
I want to thank Chairman Lipinski for holding this hearing, and I
want to thank our witnesses for attending.
Today's hearing is a good opportunity to evaluate the work being
done to improve railroad grade crossing safety, including the critical
issues of railroad trespassing and suicides, as well as problems with
blocked grade crossings.
Railroad safety is a top priority for the rail industry, for our
states and communities, and for this Committee. Preventing injuries and
fatalities on our nation's railroad tracks, including through
initiatives that address suicides, is crucial to the future of our rail
system.
Finding practical and cost-effective solutions to improve grade
crossing safety, such as through equipment upgrades, grade visibility
improvements, and closing or eliminating crossings, serve to not only
to save lives, but also eliminate traffic and gridlock in our
communities.
The rail industry and local communities have focused in on
addressing grade crossing issues. Efforts have been made to track and
prevent railroad trespassing and suicides through the use of various
technologies and expanded public education.
The FRA has recently highlighted the issue of blocked grade
crossings. It has taken steps to better understand this problem through
stakeholder outreach and improving tracking efforts, and through
soliciting public input on individual blocked crossing incidents.
I look forward to hearing about the FRA's current work to improve
grade crossings, and future plans to continue this work.
I also look forward to hearing from railroad stakeholders on the
challenges they face with grade crossing issues, including efforts to
enhance safety and save lives, and potential solutions to these
concerns.
The various federal grant programs directed at improving grade
crossings have provided assistance with crossing upgrades. The Section
130 program, which is funded by the federal government and administered
by the states, directly addresses hazards at rail crossings.
We should continue to evaluate these grant programs to ensure the
money is accessible and is being used effectively.
Thank you again to our witnesses, and I look forward to our
discussion.

Statement of Jerry C. Boles, President, Brotherhood of Railroad
Signalmen, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Peter A. DeFazio
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and honorable members of
the Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee. My name
is Jerry Boles, President of the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen
(BRS). The BRS is primarily responsible for performing the
installation, maintenance, repair, and testing of safety critical
highway-rail grade crossing warning systems. On behalf of more than
9,600 BRS members and railroad workers across the country who serve
this nation's transportation needs, I want to express my appreciation
to the Subcommittee for holding this hearing on current issues
regarding highway grade crossings including blocked grade crossings,
the improvement of grade crossing safety, and the concerns that many
communities have regarding highway grade crossings. It is imperative to
understand that the issues reflected in my testimony affects not only
the general public, but also our members, and the general safety of the
railroad.
Much of this testimony delves into life-saving and safety critical
work on highway grade crossing warning systems, which the Subcommittee
should be familiar with. While the general subjects of my testimony are
of a somewhat different nature than that under consideration by the
Subcommittee today, they are pertinent to reach the goal of zero
accidents, injuries, and/or fatalities.
As railroading has evolved, safety has always been the highest
priority for the BRS and we have worked diligently towards achieving
it. A prime example of the BRS working towards necessary safety
improvements came in the early 1990's with the implementation of life
saving and critical highway grade crossing regulations that are in
place today. These regulations addressed serious gaps in highway grade
crossing warning system safety and improved the safety of the general
public and railroad workers, as well as protected and safeguarded
railroad property. In fact, before these regulations were implemented,
there were not federal requirements to document problems and issues
that occurred at highway grade crossings, nor were there measures to
prevent them.
A brief explanation of some of the key improvements that came with
the implementation of these regulations is proper. One of the key
improvements came under 49 CFR Part 234--Subpart D--234.225, which
established parameters on a highway grade crossing warning system's
minimum warning time. 49 CFR Part 234--Subpart D--234.225 reads as
follows (in part):

``A highway-rail grade crossing warning system shall be
maintained to activate in accordance with the design of the
warning system, but in no event shall it provide less than 20
seconds warning time for the normal operation of through trains
before the grade crossing is occupied by rail traffic.''

The aforementioned regulation established that, at minimum, there
must be at least 20 seconds of actual warning time before a train
occupies the street that the railroad crosses. Conversely, 49 CFR Part
234--Subpart A--234.5 defined what occurs if that crossing warning
system does not provide the minimum warning time of 20 seconds. 49 CFR
Part 234--Subpart A--234.5 reads as follows (in part):

Activation failure means the failure of an active highway-rail
grade crossing warning system to indicate the approach of a
train at least 20 seconds prior to the train's arrival at the
crossing, or to indicate the presence of a train occupying the
crossing, unless the crossing is provided with an alternative
means of active warning to highway users of approaching trains.
(This failure indicates to the motorist that it is safe to
proceed across the railroad tracks when, in fact, it is not
safe to do so.) A grade crossing signal system does not
indicate the approach of a train within the meaning of this
paragraph if--more than 50% of the flashing lights (not gate
arm lights) on any approach lane to the crossing are not
functioning as intended, or in the case of an approach lane for
which two or more pairs of flashing lights are provided, there
is not at least one flashing light pair operating as intended.
Back lights on the far side of the crossing are not considered
in making these determinations.''

Before these regulations were in place, there was not a requirement
establishing a minimum warning time nor were there any reporting
requirements for an activation failure. Simply put, the railroads may
have desired to provide sufficient warning time; however, there was not
a regulation requiring it, nor were there any consequences if there was
not sufficient warning time. Also, there were not any requirements to
report a situation where there was not sufficient warning time.
When the minimum warning time requirement was established for
highway grade crossing warning systems, it prompted 49 CFR Part 234--
Subpart D--234.257. This regulation established the timelines for on-
site testing and visual inspections, reading as follows (in part):

``(a) Each highway-rail crossing warning system shall be tested
to determine that it functions as intended when it is placed in
service. Thereafter, it shall be tested at least once each
month and whenever modified or disarranged.

(b) Warning bells or other stationary audible warning devices
shall be tested when installed to determine that they function
as intended. Thereafter, they shall be tested at least once
each month and whenever modified or disarranged.''

Establishing that a highway grade crossing warning system can only
be considered safe with at least 20 seconds of warning time, a
regulation requiring that highway grade crossing warning systems need
to be tested and inspected every 30 days was implemented to ensure that
all components are functioning as intended. While this is a very
rudimentary explanation, the aforementioned regulations are examples of
how regulations help address and alleviate safety and problems before
they occur.
It must be noted the regulations cited above are a small sampling
of the many life-saving and critical highway grade crossing test and
inspection requirements in place that define exactly what must be done
by signal workers in order to ensure highway grade crossing warning
systems are functioning properly. The additional regulatory
requirements were established and have proven time and time again to
provide for the safest and most reliable highway grade crossing warning
systems in the railroad industry. A more detailed explanation regarding
the current regulations in place for highway grade crossing warning
systems can be provided, should the Subcommittee desire.
Since the implementation of the highway grade crossing warning
system regulations, accidents, and incidents have decreased
significantly. Concurrently, highway grade crossing warning systems
have seen vast and significant technological changes resulting in
dramatic advancements. As with any technological advance, safety of the
general public and of the workers tasked to install and maintain these
systems should be the driving force behind implementing them. However,
while technology is a valuable tool and can help increase safety at
highway grade crossings, it in no way trumps or replaces the proven
test and inspection system currently mandated.
Carriers are installing the most technologically advanced crossing
warning systems available and, in some cases, are attempting to use
those systems to argue for deregulation of time-proven tests and
inspections at highway grade crossings. Further exacerbating this
problem are the many waiver applications Administrator Batory's Federal
Railroad Administration are granting. Simply put, the more waiver
applications that are granted, the less that on-site testing and
inspections will occur. This puts the public, rail workers, and
Carriers' property at a much higher risk. Additionally, under the
inflexible Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR) business model many
railroads employ, eliminating regulations will result in larger and
unrealistic territory size. This will no doubt result in more equipment
failures, including highway grade crossing warning systems, increasing
the potential for tragic incidents and consequences.
I am certain that the main reason there are so few tragic failures
that result from equipment malfunction on highway grade crossing
warning systems is due to the fact that signal workers are on-site
doing required, regular testing and inspections. What Congress,
regulatory agencies, and the general public may not realize is there
are many times that failures of the highway grade crossing warning
system, and the potentially tragic consequences that may occur, never
actually happen because of the regulatory mandate for on-site testing
and inspections.
Further, while some would try to convince us that technology can
somehow replace the regulations currently in place, this would actually
be a step back and would no doubt result in more accidents and
incidents. Moreover, individuals not familiar with the day to day
testing and inspection requirements would have us believe that
technology is somehow responsible for the good track record in highway
grade crossing safety, rather than current testing and inspection
requirements, which is simply not true. Make no mistake, technology
does not make highway grade crossing warning systems safe; life- saving
testing, inspection requirements, and the workers tasked with
performing them make crossings safe.
Our economy is reliant upon the many trains that ship our goods
across our country. Shipping by rail is one of the safest, most
efficient, and environmentally-friendly transportation options
available, and it is incumbent upon all of us to find ways to minimize
the likelihood of another accident at any railroad grade crossing. The
BRS has consistently fought to improve safety for our members and the
public through measures such as highway grade crossing warning system
regulations, roadway worker rules, and the Rail Safety Improvement Act
of 2008. These are just some of the innovations we are proud to have
advocated for and accomplished. However, we realize that the work of
keeping our nations rail network safe never ends and we will continue
to work with Labor, the FRA, the National Transportation Safety Board
(NTSB), Railroads, and Congress to ensure safety for the general
public, rail workers, and railroad property.

Letter of February 13, 2020, from Ann Begeman, Chairman, Surface
Transportation Board, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Daniel Lipinski
February 13, 2020.
Hon. Daniel Lipinski,
Chairman,
Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials, U.S.
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
Dear Chairman Lipinski,
I am writing in response to certain witness testimony given last
week during your Subcommittee's hearing entitled, ``Tracking Toward
Zero: Improving Grade Crossing Safety and Addressing Community
Concerns.'' Specifically, Alderman Matthew O'Shea commented on the
impacts of blocked crossings in his ward as a result of rail operations
by CSX Transportation Inc. (CSXT) on the Elsdon Line in the Chicago
area. The purpose of this letter is to address issues raised by
Alderman O'Shea with respect to the Surface Transportation Board (STB
or Board) and its work concerning the Elsdon Line.
In 2013, the Board approved CSXT's application to acquire an
operating easement over the Grand Trunk Western Railway Company's
Elsdon Line. See CSX Transp., Inc.--Acquis. of Operating Easement--
Grand Trunk W. R.R., FD 35522 (STB served Feb. 8, 2013). That approval
was made subject to conditions, including voluntary mitigation measures
proposed by CSXT and mandatory mitigation measures developed by the
Board's Office of Environmental Analysis (OEA), to help mitigate
anticipated effects of the transaction with respect to, among other
things, traffic and grade crossing delay, emergency response,
pedestrian and bicycle safety, and rail safety. The Board also imposed
monitoring and enforcement conditions requiring CSXT to report
quarterly (for three years) on the progress of, implementation of, and
compliance with, the mitigation measures.
The Board recognized that the Village of Evergreen Park and other
communities experienced frustrating and difficult challenges when CSXT
commenced operations on the Elsdon Line. That is why the Board remained
actively engaged after the transaction's approval. In addition to the
Board-monitored mitigation, Board members met with CSXT officials to
discuss operational concerns on the line. Board members and staff also
traveled to Evergreen Park in 2014 and 2015 to visit with officials and
tour the most impacted areas first-hand. And, Board staff communicated
regularly with State Representative Kelly Burke, Mayor James Sexton,
and CSXT representatives to address community concerns regarding rail
operations.
These efforts continued until the Board formally reopened the
proceeding on June 22, 2016, stating that CSXT had been allowed more
than enough time to address the many problems that had arisen on the
line since the application was approved. The Board ordered CSXT to
comply with the representation it made in its application (that it
would not route a train onto the Elsdon Line unless the line was clear)
or show cause why it is unable to do so. Additionally, the Board
ordered CSXT to report monthly on a number of issues, including gate
malfunctions and crossing blockages exceeding 10 minutes. The Board
twice extended CSXT's monthly reporting requirements, with the final
monthly report being filed July 16, 2018. In a decision served July 27,
2018, the Board noted that, while CSXT's monthly reports indicated that
CSXT had reduced the number of false activations on the line, issues
remained regarding the number and duration of blocked crossings. The
Board ordered CSXT to establish and provide to the Board a plan
detailing additional actions CSXT would take to improve fluidity and
reduce the number and duration of blocked crossings on the line. CSXT
submitted its response in August 2018.
Please be assured that the Board has maintained an active role,
both formally and informally, in overseeing CSXT's implementation of
the transaction and the required mitigation measures and has continued
its informal oversight. Last May, the Board sent a letter to CSXT
President and CEO James Foote requesting an update on operations over
the Elsdon Line, specifically asking about the line's fluidity and
specific actions CSXT had taken during 2019 to enhance train movement
and bolster community engagement. In response, Mr. Foote reported
continued favorable performance trends including a 35% reduction in the
number of blocked crossings and a 23% reduction in the total duration
of those blockages. CSXT further reported that 97% of trains traversed
a grade crossing in 10 minutes or less. Moreover, I request an update
on operations on the Elsdon Line each time I meet with CSXT officials.
Attached please find a status update regarding the three mitigation
provisions raised in the Alderman's testimony. I'd be happy to answer
any questions you may have regarding these matters. The Board's
decisions, parties' filings, and CSXT monthly reports related to these
matters may be found on the Board's website under Docket No. FD 35522.
Additionally, the Board's May 2019 letter to Mr. Foote is available on
Board's website under Non-Docketed Public Correspondence.
Thank you for the opportunity to provide information regarding some
of the Board's many actions concerning the Elsdon Line. Please do not
hesitate to contact me or Lucille Marvin, Director of the Office of
Public Assistance, Governmental Affairs, and Compliance, if you or your
staff have any questions or would like further information.
Sincerely,
Ann Begeman,
Chairman.

Alderman O'Shea's testimony included allegations concerning three
specific mitigation measures imposed by the Board in its 2013 decision
approving the transaction. The three mitigation measures are stated
below, along with the status of their implementation:
Mandatory Mitigation Measure 2 (MM 2). MM 2 required CSXT to
consult with all appropriate agencies and hospitals to install a
closed-circuit television system with video cameras so that the
movement of trains could be predicted at the 95th Street highway/rail
at-grade crossing. CSXT was to fund, install, and maintain all
necessary equipment. This was to be done in order to further assist
with the timely response of emergency service providers for Advocate
Christ Medical Center and the Little Company of Mary Hospital.

In its December 31, 2013 quarterly monitoring report,
CSXT informed the Board that installation and operation of the closed-
circuit camera was completed. Evergreen Park controls the camera. The
Board has not been received any complaints or comments regarding this
mitigation measure or its status of completeness.

Voluntary Mitigation Measure 37 (VM 37). VM 37 required CSXT to
notify Emergency Services Dispatching Centers for communities along the
affected segments of all crossings blocked by trains that are stopped
and may be unable to move for a significant amount of time. CSXT was
required to work with affected communities to minimize emergency
vehicle delay by maintaining facilities for emergency communication
with local Emergency Response Centers through a dedicated toll-free
number.

In its May 31, 2016 quarterly monitoring report, CSXT
informed the Board that it had installed a dedicated toll-free number
on all road crossings and CSXT's Public Safety Coordination Center was
notifying its Command Center of blocked crossings.

Voluntary Mitigation Measure 6 (VM 6): VM 6 required CSXT to
operate under U.S. Operating Rule No. 526 (Public Crossings), which
provides that a public crossing must not be blocked longer than 10
minutes, unless the blockage cannot be avoided. VM 6 also required that
the train be promptly cut to clear the blocked crossing if the blockage
was likely to exceed this time frame.

On July 27, 2017, the Board granted CSXT's unopposed
request to revise VM 6 because, based on CSXT's monthly reports, the
voluntary mitigation measure proposed by CSXT--that it would cut a
train if that train would block a crossing for more than 10 minutes--
had proven infeasible (causing longer delays) in many circumstances.
Accordingly, VM 6 was revised to read as follows: ``CSXT shall take
appropriate actions to clear a public crossing or crossings blocked by
a stopped train as quickly as possible, including by cutting the train
where it appears that cutting the train would be the fastest way to
clear the crossing and, if possible, rail cars, engines, and rail
equipment may not stand closer than 200 feet from a highway/rail at-
grade crossing when there is an adjacent track.''

Letter of February 11, 2020, from John Patelli, Head of Regulatory and
Federal Affairs/Associate General Counsel, CSX Transportation,
Submitted for the Record by Hon. Daniel Lipinski
February 11, 2020.
Hon. Daniel Lipinski,
Chairman,
Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Washington, DC.
Dear Chairman Lipinski,
CSX is submitting this letter and request it be included in the
hearing record in response to certain testimony at the Subcommittee on
Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials' February 5, 2020 hearing:
Tracking Toward Zero: Improving Grade Crossing Safety and Addressing
Community Concerns. Specifically, certain testimony presented by a
Chicago alderman at that hearing contained significant misstatements
about CSX's operations on the Elsdon Line in the Chicago area and the
Surface Transportation Board's (``STB's'') monitoring of those
operations. These misstatements included inaccurate allegations that
grade crossing blockages on the Elsdon Line remain a significant
problem; that CSX had not complied with an STB condition requiring
construction of a closed circuit television monitoring system; and that
the STB should not have concluded formal monitoring in June 2018.
The facts show that the Elsdon Line is a tremendous success story
for what can be achieved by railroads, communities and government
striving towards a common goal. When CSX acquired operating rights on
the Elsdon Line in 2013, the track and signals on the Line were not in
the condition required for consistent and reliable operations, and we
experienced equipment failures and operational problems that led to an
unexpectedly high number of blocked grade crossings, including in the
communities of Evergreen Park and the 19th Ward. But the story did not
end there. We responded to the community's and the STB's concerns by
taking multiple significant actions to improve our performance and
reduce the impact of rail operations in the communities through which
the Line runs. We made $31 million in capital investments in the Line,
including major investments to replace signals equipment, improve
fluidity, and alleviate chokepoints. We also took a hard look at our
operating procedures to find ways to reduce blocked crossings,
including improved communications with connecting railroads. We also
committed to extensive engagement with the community, meeting regularly
with community leaders to address issues and ensuring that the public
had clear ways to express and resolve their concerns. Our capital
investments, operational changes, and improved community outreach are
detailed in our STB filings.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ See, e.g., Response to July 27, 2018 Decision, CSX Transp.,
Inc.--Acquisition of Operating Easement--Grand Trunk W. R.R., STB
Docket No. 35522 (filed Aug. 23, 2018)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
These efforts resulted in substantial reductions in blocked
crossings on the Elsdon Line. In 2018, CSX showed that the Elsdon's
fluidity level (as measured by average train speed) was on par or
better than any other CSX Chicago corridor.\2\ Indeed CSX's performance
on the Line has only improved since the STB discontinued monthly
reporting. For example, during the entire month of January 2020, only
two CSXT trains were forced to stop in the portions of the Line running
through Evergreen Park and the 19th Ward (which are the portions of the
Line that were the focus of grade crossing concerns expressed to the
STB). Every other train traversed these communities without stopping
once. During the fourth quarter of 2019 and the partial first quarter
of 2020, 95% of trains passing through Evergreen Park and the 19th Ward
cleared grade crossings in less than 10 minutes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ See id. at 32-35.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moreover, the alderman's claim that CSX is not complying with a
condition that the STB placed on the transaction is simply wrong. The
alderman testified that CSX had disregarded the STB's requirement that
CSX install a closed circuit television system to monitor the 95th
Street at-grade crossing to assist with the timely responses of
emergency service providers to the Advocate Christ Medical Center and
the Little Company of Mary Hospital. He specifically said that ``no
system has been installed,'' and suggested that the STB had failed to
take any action to enforce this condition. This is not true. In 2013,
CSX completed installation of a closed-circuit TV monitoring system
after consultation with the Village of Evergreen Park, Advocate Christ
Medical Center and the Little Company of Mary Hospital. Based on that
consultation, cameras were installed on the roof of the Evergreen Park
municipal facility, which provides a good vantage point to view the
95th Street grade crossing, and monitoring equipment was provided to
Evergreen Park. CSX paid for all installation, equipment, and training
costs. It was agreed by all parties that Evergreen Park would maintain
control of the camera and the monitoring system; because hospitals do
not dispatch ambulances, they saw no need to themselves monitor the
video feed.
CSX reported to the STB in 2013 that the closed circuit TV was
installed.\3\ The alderman should have been well aware of this fact,
since it was discussed at a technical hearing before the STB on October
21, 2016 that he attended and in multiple pleadings with which he was
served.\4\ Before the alderman's testimony last week, CSXT's compliance
with this requirement has never been contested by the alderman, the
Village of Evergreen Park, or any other party.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mitigation Measures at 6, CSX Transp., Inc.--Acquisition of Operating
Easement--Grand Trunk W. R.R., STB Docket No. 35522 (filed Dec. 31,
2013) (``Installation and operating of the closed circuit camera[a] is

STB Docket No. 35522 (filed May 30, 2017) (same).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Finally, it was ill-informed to suggest the STB should not have
discontinued formal monitoring of the Line back in June of 2018. On the
contrary, the STB responded to the community's concerns by requiring
monthly reporting on blocked crossings for two years (July 2016 through
June 2018). The STB only discontinued that monitoring after CSX
presented a detailed report explaining the actions it had taken to
reduce grade crossing blockages on the Elsdon, the actions it planned
to take in the future, and how CSX's fluidity on the Elsdon compared to
other lines in Chicago. No party contested that evidence.
Similarly, the complaint about the STB's decision to amend the
condition indicating that any trains blocking a crossing for more than
ten minutes must be cut ignores the STB's sound basis for that
amendment. In most circumstances, the operation to cut and reassemble a
train would take an hour or more, and make grade crossing delays worse,
not better. As a result, the STB made a well-supported decision to
amend this condition into a requirement that CSXT ``take appropriate
actions to clear a public crossing or crossings blocked by a stopped
train as quickly as possible, including by cutting the train where it
appears that cutting the train would be the fastest way to clear the
crossing.'' \5\ No party opposed this request.

We hope that this correction to the record is useful to the
Subcommittee's work. CSXT remains committed to providing excellent,
fluid service over the Elsdon Line and being actively engaged with all
the communities through which we operate. Please let us know if we can
provide further information or do anything else to assist you or the
Subcommittee. We look forward to continuing to work with you on these
important issues in the district and around the nation.

Letter of February 19, 2020, from Hon. Jim Cooper, a Representative in
Congress from the State of Tennessee, Submitted for the Record by Hon.
Daniel Lipinski
February 19, 2020.
Chairman Lipinski and Ranking Member Crawford,
I appreciate the opportunity to submit documents for the record on
behalf of my constituents who are elected leaders in Nashville. Their
statements demonstrate the impact of blocked grade crossings on our
community.
Middle Tennesseans are far too familiar with the inconvenience and
safety concerns that blocked rail crossings pose to Nashville--from
blocked roads during rush hour to emergency response vehicles being
routinely rerouted. It's frustrating and dangerous.
CSX's former CEO famously believed that their freight always came
before Nashville commuters or commuters anywhere. I strongly disagree.
That kind of thinking gives freight rail a bad name. Respecting rush
hour, and the needs of commuters, should be the normal course of
behavior for railroads.
There must be ways to force railroads to work with U.S. taxpayers
to help everyone get their work done on time. Freight railroad
companies should be able to turn a profit and move Middle Tennessee's
goods without an entire community grinding to a halt.
If the Federal Railroad Administration won't take action to
regulate blocked crossings, Congress needs to step in and allow cities
and states to govern the issue themselves. Who knows the area better
than our locally-elected officials?
I am thankful to you for holding this hearing and calling attention
to a problem that has persisted far too long. In the meantime, I am
going to keep trying to find a way to stop this abuse and I look
forward to continue working with the Subcommittee.
Sincerely,
Jim Cooper,
Member of Congress.

Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Washington, DC.
Hon.  Rick Crawford,
Ranking Member,
Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Washington, DC.
Dear Chairman Lipinski and Ranking Member Crawford,
Every four hours in America, either a person or a vehicle is hit by
a train--and many of these crashes occur at-grade crossings. As Mayor
of a city with 142 public at-grade crossings, many of which are in dire
need of improvement, I'm writing to urge you both to strongly consider
increasing infrastructure investments to help improve the condition of
railroad crossings throughout Nashville and the State of Tennessee.
Nashville's SMSA population has exponentially grown to over 1.9
million residents in recent years. Last year alone, we broke visitor
records with 16,000,000 tourists from throughout the United States and
around the world. Accordingly, our community's infrastructure requires
a considerable amount of maintenance to protect in order to protect the
safety of all our residents and visitors alike.
I strongly encourage you and the other esteemed members of the
House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to consider the
safety and well-being of Nashvillians, as well as the economic
contributions and burdens of municipalities like ours, when carefully
deliberating the benefits of increased at-grade railroad crossing
investments.
Sincerely,
John Cooper,
Mayor, Metropolitan
Government of Nashville
and Davidson County.

Dear Sirs,
Thank you for the opportunity to give input to the Subcommittee on
Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials. In addition to being a
member of Metro Council, I also represent Metro Nashville-Davidson
County as a board member of the Nashville & Eastern Rail Authority and
have enjoyed my service there. As Nashville and Middle Tennessee's
growth continues to skyrocket, the number of commuters on our roads
has, of course, increased as well and ``rush hour'' has become a multi-
hour challenging commute. Traffic jams can occur much more quickly due
to the high volume of automobiles and those negative effects are
compounded when long freight trains cross major arteries during those
times.
My constituents have reported to me on many occasions about their
experiences when a train is crossing the highway during morning and
afternoon rush hour. Three such examples of areas receiving numerous
reports are:

The crossing over U.S. Highway 70 / State Route 24 at
Lebanon Pike where it becomes Hermitage Avenue.

The crossing near Elm Hill Pike at Arlington Avenue. Elm
Hill Pike is parallel to Lebanon Pike as well as Interstate 40 and all
are used to commute into and out of downtown Nashville. Although Elm
Hill Pike is not a U.S. Highway or State Route, it is a four-lane road
with the same auto capacity as the Lebanon Pike crossing.

The crossings over 2nd Avenue, 4th Avenue, and Chestnut
Avenue.

This not only affects automobile commuters, it has also affected
WeGo, our public transit system. The CSX crossing on Nolensville Pike
is one such location where a WeGo bus is stuck fairly regularly.
Thank you again and I stand ready to assist with this issue however
I can be of service.
Best Regards,
Jeff Syracuse,
Metro Council Member,

American Public Transportation Association, Submitted for the Record by
Hon. Daniel Lipinski
Introduction
Chairman Lipinski, Ranking Member Crawford, and Members of the
Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials, on
behalf of the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) and its
1,500 public- and private-sector member organizations, thank you for
the opportunity to submit testimony for the record on ``Tracking Toward
Zero: Improving Grade Crossing Safety and Addressing Community
Concerns.''
My name is Paul Skoutelas, and I am the President and Chief
Executive Officer (CEO) of APTA, an international association
representing a $71 billion industry that employs 430,000 people and
supports millions of private-sector jobs. We are the only association
in North America that represents all modes of public transportation--
bus, paratransit, light rail, commuter rail, subways, waterborne
services, and high-performance intercity passenger rail.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ APTA members include public transportation systems; planning,
design, construction, and finance firms; product and service providers;
academic institutions; state transit associations; and state
departments of transportation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Public transportation not only spurs economic growth, but reduces
congestion, improves air quality, saves time and money, and advances an
equitable and better quality of life for our communities.
Commuter Rail
Nearly 40 years ago, Congress enacted the Northeast Rail Services
Act of 1981 (P.L. 97-35) to salvage commuter rail operations from
Conrail and created six commuter rail authorities.\2\ The state of
commuter rail at that time suffered from low and declining ridership
and equipment long beyond its useful life. These agencies and the many
others across the nation that existed then or have started anew have
transformed commuter rail into an essential, reliable, growing, safe,
and affordable mobility option carrying hundreds of millions of
travelers each year.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ The six commuter rail authorities are the: Metropolitan
Transportation Authority; Connecticut Department of Transportation;
Maryland Department of Transportation; Southeastern Pennsylvania
Transportation Authority (SEPTA); New Jersey Transit Corporation; and
Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Today, commuter rail is a $9.9 billion industry, creating and
supporting more than 200,000 public- and private-sector jobs. Moreover,
the overwhelming majority (63 percent) of this funding flows to the
private sector.
32 Commuter Rail Agencies
Today, there are 32 agencies operating commuter railroads.\3\
Commuter rail services are higher-speed, higher capacity trains with
less frequent stops. They are traditionally used to connect people from
suburban areas to city centers. In the last decade, nine new commuter
rail systems \4\ have begun operation, with the latest--TexRail in Fort
Worth, Texas--starting up last year.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ A list of commuter railroad agencies can be found in Appendix
A. APTA's list includes all commuter and hybrid rail agencies that
receive funding from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and
report data to the National Transit Database.
\4\ The nine new systems are Portland, OR (Westside Express, 2009);
Minneapolis, MN (Northstar, 2009); Austin, TX (Capital MetroRail,
2010); Denton, TX (A Train, 2011); Orlando, FL (SunRail, 2014); Denver,
CO (A Line, 2016); Marin County, CA (SMART, 2017); Antioch, CA (eBART,
2018); and Fort Worth, TX (TEXRail, 2019).

Safety is a Core Value
For commuter rail operators and the entire public transportation
industry, safety is a core value--a non-negotiable operating principle
and promise to our riders. The men and women responsible for managing
and operating public transportation systems are fully committed to the
safety of their systems, passengers, employees, and the general public.
As a result of this overriding and sustained commitment to safety,
public transportation is the safest form of surface transportation.
Every year, 32 commuter railroads across America safely carry
passengers on more than 500 million trips. And, traveling by commuter
and intercity passenger rail is 18 times safer than traveling by car.
Highway-Rail Grade-Crossing Safety and Trespassing Issues
Highway-rail grade-crossing safety and trespassing remain
significant issues for commuter rail. Over the last five years (2014-
2018), 96 percent of commuter railroad fatalities were attributable to
highway-rail grade-crossing or trespassing. Commuter rail systems
operate on approximately 3,447 publicly accessible grade crossings.

Grade-Crossing Safety
Our commuter railroads have been working hard to mitigate these
grade-crossing incidents, often involving unlawful entry to the
railroad's right of way. These incidents cost lives, cause serious
injuries and property losses, and result in delays to the traveling
public. To address highway-rail grade-crossing hazards, commuter rail
agencies are using myriad treatments and technologies, including
creating pedestrian crossings, constructing corridor fencing,
installing delineators, and placing cameras at crossings and in
railcars. Engineered solutions are very expensive to construct.
According to a recent Government Accountability Office (GAO) report,\5\
2016 Department of Transportation data show that separating a grade
crossing from traffic can cost between $5 million and $40 million,
while installing four quadrant gates to grade crossings with flashing
lights can cost between $250,000 to $500,000.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\5\ See GAO, Grade Crossing Safety; DOT Should Evaluate Whether
Program Provides States Flexibility to Address Ongoing Challenges (GAO-
19-80) (November 2018), at 24.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Private-sector mapping technology is also critical to combating
this significant safety issue. For example, the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority's Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) and Metro-North
have partnered with Waze to integrate a railroad crossing warning into
its GPS application. The application warns drivers that they are
approaching a grade crossing and not to turn onto the tracks. LIRR and
Metro-North automated a feed to ensure the hazard alerts are always
maintained in the Waze application. In conjunction with the Waze
implementation, LIRR installed delineators and road markings at its
more than 290,000 grade crossings. As a result, LIRR experienced an
immediate and remarkable reduction in events significantly enhancing
its safety and operations. SEPTA also partners with Waze and provides
the company with a table of its grade-crossing locations. Using this
table, Waze updates the information daily for six months. After the
six-month period is up, SEPTA re-sends Waze the grade-crossing file.
APTA is encouraged by these individual partnerships with technology
companies and welcomes other map navigation developers to work with our
industry to add automatic notifications of railroad grade crossings to
their maps. There are too many senseless incidents and deaths because
cars do not stop at grade crossings or bypass the gates. Navigation
developers have created powerful tools for helping us find our way and
drive more safely. With their support, we can provide an important tool
to warn drivers and prevent needless accidents and deaths.
Education is key and many commuter rail agencies have participated
in specific campaigns to reduce highway-rail grade-crossing incidents.
It will take a collective effort to reduce these grade-crossing
incidents. Although we are grateful for Congress' continued funding of
grade-crossing measures under the railway-highway crossings set-aside
(23 U.S.C. 130), more needs to be done.
APTA urges Congress to authorize a total of $1.5 billion over six
years ($225 million per year) under the CRISI program to provide grants
to commuter rail and operators in high-ridership corridors for highway-
rail grade-crossing safety initiatives.
Trespassing on Railroad Properties
Commuter railroads are also addressing the long-standing, critical
issue of trespassing on railroad tracks. APTA's most recent analysis of
commuter rail data over the last five years indicate that trespassing
remains a major contributing factor to railroad fatalities--nearly 70
percent of rail-related fatalities were as a result of trespassing.
Causal factors for trespassing-related fatalities include suicide,
direct-route crossing, and general distraction.\6\ Trespassing issues
are complex. Our commuter railroads have partnered with their local
communities, mental health care providers, law enforcement, and
national organizations to launch educational campaigns about the
dangers of trespassing and to develop ways to mitigate these incidents.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\6\ Federal Railroad Administration, Report to Congress: National
Strategy to Prevent Trespassing on Railroad Property (October 2018), at
11.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
For example, in 2016, Metro-North launched a rail education and
community outreach program designed to reduce grade-crossing incidents.
Its safety outreach program, Together Railroads And Communities Keeping
Safe (TRACKS), was developed in response to a 2015 grade-crossing
incident in which six people were killed. One focus of the TRACKS
program is to educate the younger members of the Metro-North community
with presentations specifically targeted to children using a character
called Metro-Man. Since its launch, TRACKS has reached nearly 345,000
people in the Metro-North service area and Metro-North reports a
decrease in trespasser strikes of 14 percent in 2019.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\7\ LIRR launched its TRACKS program in 1988 as a result of the
deaths of nine teenagers whose van was hit by a train after driving
around activated crossing gates. In partnership with the MTA Police
Department, the program reaches over 100,000 participants annually.
Training is provided to audiences from preschool through adults in
schools, community settings, and businesses.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
APTA and its commuter rail members will continue to be leading
advocates to improve railroad and public safety. We urge Congress to do
its part by providing the funding that is needed to assist commuter
rail in making these important safety investments. In addition, we urge
Congress to ensure that the rail statutes and regulations, which are
often very prescriptive, do not prevent railroads from introducing new
technologies to make our railroads safer.
Surface Transportation Authorization Recommendations
On October 12, 2019, APTA's Board of Directors unanimously approved
APTA Recommendations on Surface Transportation Law, reflecting the
consensus views and priorities of APTA's diverse membership, including
commuter rail.
APTA strongly urges the Committee to invest $145 billion over six
years in public transportation and fund critical projects that will
repair, maintain, and improve our public transit systems (including
commuter rail) today and in the future. Our proposal, which includes
$112 billion for Urbanized Area Formula, State of Good Repair, and CIG
grants, would address the entire state-of-good-repair backlog and fund
all CIG projects in the pipeline in the next six years.
Together with this increased funding, APTA recommends that the
Committee conduct a zero-based review of the CIG program to assess all
statutory, regulatory, and other administrative requirements. We have
previously testified that the bureaucratic maze that project sponsors,
including commuter railroads, must adhere to is costly and burdensome.
Finally, APTA calls on the Committee to create a Passenger Rail
Trust Fund funded in part with new, long-term, dedicated revenues to
significantly increase passenger rail investment to $32 billion over
six years. This investment would include $7.1 billion for CRISI grants.
More investment is needed to ensure that commuter rail agencies can
pay for important safety initiatives, including mitigating grade-
crossing incidents and funding the operation and maintenance costs of
positive train control (PTC). APTA urges the Committee to expand the
eligibility of the CRISI grant program to commuter rail to provide
specific funding for:

Passenger Rail-Highway Grade Crossing Grants ($250
million per year; $1.5 billion over six years); and

Operations and maintenance of PTC ($160 million per year;
$1 billion over six years).

We urge Congress to provide the necessary, dedicated funding to
ensure safe, reliable, and efficient commuter rail systems.
Conclusion
On behalf of APTA, thank you for giving us the opportunity to
submit testimony for the record on ``Tracking Toward Zero: Improving
Grade Crossing Safety and Addressing Community Concerns''. We look
forward to working with the Committee on Transportation and
Infrastructure as it writes the next Surface Transportation
Authorization Act. It is imperative that we make meaningful investments
in commuter rail to enable these critical services to continue to
remain safe, grow, serve our communities, and contribute to the
national economy.

Letter of February 20, 2020, from Mike O'Malley, President, Railway
Supply Institute, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Daniel Lipinski
February 20, 2020.
Hon. Daniel Lipinski,
Chairman,
House Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials,
Washington, DC.
Hon. Rick Crawford,
Ranking Member,
House Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials,
Washington, DC.
Dear Chairman Lipinski and Ranking Member Crawford,
On behalf of the members of the Railway Supply Institute (RSI),
thank you for this opportunity to submit this statement for the record
in response to the February 5, 2020 hearing ``Tracking Toward Zero:
Improving Grade Crossing Safety and Addressing Community Concerns.''
RSI is a trade association representing more than 200 companies
involved in the manufacture of products and services in the freight
car, tank car, locomotive, maintenance-of-way, communications and
signaling, and passenger rail industries. America's railway suppliers
represent a $74 billion/year industry supporting more than 125,000
American workers.
Rail suppliers serve as a critical component to the railroad
industry, and our economic impact on the communities in which we
manufacture our products is vitally important. From rail cars and
tracks to signals and switches, the railway supply industry has been a
vital and dynamic part of the U.S. economy for over 200 years. Railway
suppliers play an essential role in supporting the rail system here in
the U.S. and have done so since the origin of U.S. railroads in the
early 1800's. In 2017, the North American railroad system comprised
more than 1.6 million railcars powered by more than 38,000 locomotives
over more than 140,000 miles of rail. Nearly every piece of this
intricate puzzle was shaped and put into place by railroad suppliers
for their railroad customers. Today, the rail industry is leading the
transportation world in technological advancements and has embraced
digitization and the Internet of Things (IoT). Such technology has
generated significant improvements in operational safety and network
efficiency and much of it was developed and driven by the railway
supply community.
Increased investment in our rail and public transportation systems
will vastly improve the safety, efficiency and productivity of moving
goods and people across the United States. Greater public investments,
coupled with policies that incentivize private investments, could
relieve major bottlenecks and chokepoints and increase track, tunnel,
bridge and station capacity across the passenger and freight rail
system. Such enhanced investments will also encourage greater use of
rail in moving both people and goods, thus reducing harmful emissions
and growing congestion on our nation's roadways. These investments also
will help directly support and sustain the more than 125,000 jobs tied
to the rail supply industry, including high-value manufacturing jobs
spread across all parts of the country.
RSI encourages Congress to support rail safety by continuing to
provide funds for the elimination of hazards at railway-highway
crossings. The Section 130 Railway Highway Crossing Program has helped
railroads, suppliers, and our state partners deliver a significant
decrease in fatalities at railway-highway grade crossings. From 1987
through 2018, fatalities at these crossings have decreased by 58
percent. RSI strongly supports the Section 130 program and makes the
following recommendations to further strengthen it:
A.  Increase federal match for Section 130 program to 100% federal
share, like many other highway safety programs.
B.  Incentive Payments: States and railroads currently may make
incentive payments of up to $7,500 for the permanent closure of
railway-highway grade crossings. Although there are funds set aside to
help incentivize communities to close grade crossings, the $7,500 limit
is often not enough to convince officials to support closing as these
projects are substantially more expensive. Congress should increase the
limit on incentive payments from $7,500 to $100,000 for the closing of
a railway-highway grade crossing.
C.  Modernize Eligible Activity: There is confusion among the
states as to whether Section 130 funds can be used for the replacement
of functionally obsolete warning devices. It is imperative to make
clear that these funds can be used for their replacement because these
devices are critical to the safe and efficient operation of railway-
highway grade crossings.
D.  In Section 130(f)(3) of S. 2302, the Senate Environment &
Public Works Committee approved bill, the measure directs GAO to
perform a study of the effectiveness of the Section 130 program. RSI
recommends adding an additional requirement that the railroad and rail
supply industry be consulted as party of this study.

RSI also supports continued funding for Operation Lifesaver (OLI),
a nonprofit public safety education and awareness organization
dedicated to reducing collisions, fatalities and injuries at railway
highway crossings and trespassing on or near railroad tracks. OLI plays
a critical role in rail safety and is funded by a combination of
federal and private funding. With a nationwide network of volunteers,
OLI provides free safety presentations and creates education programs
and public awareness campaigns to reach audiences of all ages. In 2017,
the organization reached 2.1 million people directly via 21,226 safety
presentations, 245 training sessions and 1,821 special events conducted
by state programs nationwide in 2017. In addition, 333 CDL drivers and
1,912 school bus drivers were exposed to OLI's online eLearning safety
programs during the year. Section 1418, Consolidation of Programs, of
FAST Act authorizes not less than $3.5 million from Highway Safety
Improvement Program for fiscal years 20162020 distributed among four
activities: Operation Lifesaver, Work Zone and Guardrail Safety
Training, the National Work Zone Safety Information Clearinghouse, and
the Public Road Safety Clearinghouse. RSI recommends continuing or
expanding federal investments in OLI given its demonstrated track
record in enhancing safety awareness nationwide.
Finally, as Congress considers the reauthorization of the FAST Act,
this subcommittee can help ensure public investments achieve better
reliability and resiliency by recognizing and incentivizing digital
infrastructure applications as part of eligible public investments to
provide increased reliability, efficiency, and lengthen the life of
rail assets. These applications should advance rail and transit
automation for both commuter and intercity passenger rail, and
intermodal applications including seaport-rail network connections
where appropriate. Today's rolling stock manufacturers and rail
technology suppliers offer Internet of Things (IoT) platforms to
virtually monitor, analyze and predict rail operations for smarter,
safer and more reliable systems. By incentivizing the increased
deployment of the ``Internet of Trains,'' commuter and intercity
passenger rail operators can bring their operations into the digital
era. Public benefits include reduced unplanned downtime, improved
operational efficiency, better business planning, improved performance,
as well as energy savings. Digitalizing rail operations that receive
federal funds is the single best way to maximize the use of public
funds granted to localities and take advantage of technologies that
have already been widely deployed by America's privately-owned
railroads.
In closing, RSI continues to seek dedicated investment in
infrastructure, balanced economic regulation, and the promotion of
domestic manufacturing to drive American innovation. We are encouraged
by the interest shown by Congress to bring America's transportation
systems into the 21st century. We look forward to working with this
Subcommittee as we continue to look for ways to innovate, enhance and
promote investment in rail infrastructure and our national freight and
passenger rail system.
Thank you for the opportunity to share our views.
Sincerely,
Mike O'Malley,
President.

Statement of Ian Jefferies, President and Chief Executive Officer,
Association of American Railroads, Submitted for the Record by Hon.
Eric A. ``Rick'' Crawford
Introduction
On behalf of the members of the Association of American Railroads
(AAR), thank you for the opportunity to submit this statement for the
record. AAR members include the seven U.S. Class I freight railroads;
scores of U.S. short line and regional freight railroads; Amtrak and
several major U.S. commuter railroads; and dozens of suppliers and
others associated with the rail industry.
Railroads are well aware that blocked grade crossings can lead to
friction with impacted communities. Railroads try to be good neighbors
at all times and seek to minimize negative community impacts in all
aspects of their operations. However, as communities near rail lines
and rail facilities expand; as motor vehicle traffic increases and new
roads are built; and as rail traffic patterns change, new challenges
related to grade crossings continuously arise.
Railroads don't want a stopped train any more than the broader
community does--it's in the best interest of railroads to keep trains
moving safely and efficiently and to minimize conflicts with the
communities in which they operate. Because of the complexity of rail
operations and the sometimes-competing demands of other stakeholders
(for example, rail customers versus residents living near those
customers), finding effective solutions to the challenges often takes
significant time and effort, but railroads are committed to working
cooperatively with local officials and other stakeholders to address
these challenges as effectively as possible.
Why Do Grade Crossing Blockages Occur?
A highway-rail grade crossing is where a railway and roadway
intersect at the same level. There are nearly 210,000 public grade
crossings (that is, where a rail line intersects with a road) in the
United States. Meanwhile, total motor vehicle miles driven in the
United States continue to rise, reaching a record 3.24 trillion in
2018,\1\ thanks in part to the fact that the U.S. population sets a new
record every day. And demand for moving things by rail won't go away:
the Federal Highway Administration forecasts that total U.S. freight
shipments will rise from an estimated 17.8 billion tons in 2017 to 24.1
billion tons in 2040, a 35 percent increase.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Federal Highway Administration, Highway Statistics 2018, Table
VM-1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In aggregate, these and related factors mean that interactions
between railroads and the public, and potential conflicts, are a fact
of life and have to be actively managed.
There's no simple answer to the question ``what causes blocked
crossings?'' because there are so many actual and potential causes.
Some blockages result from what are basically random acts over which
railroads have little or no control--e.g., weather events or an ``act
of God'' like a sudden rockslide in an inopportune area; an accident at
a neighboring grade crossing that halts nearby trains; vandalism of
rail signals or tracks; the presence of trespassers on rail tracks;
emergency response activity in an area that requires trains to stop;
and so on. It is impossible to plan in advance for these kinds of
eventualities, but when they occur, railroads work very hard to return
to normal operations and eliminate negative impacts on nearby
communities.
Other blockages are the result of actions or factors that are
associated with rail operating practices in one way or another--e.g.,
temporary blockages as railcars are dropped off or picked up at a rail
customer facility that's located near a grade crossing, or congestion
on the tracks ahead or in a nearby rail yard; \2\ a track signal
malfunction; equipment breakdowns or lack of preparedness at rail
customer facilities that make timely rail movements impossible; a
defective freight car or segment of track that necessitates slow speeds
or an emergency halt in train movements; or mandatory safety tests or
crew changes required by government regulation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ In many cases, blockages occur at crossings near customer
facilities or rail facilities that were originally built in isolated
areas but, because of community expansion, now find themselves adjacent
to roadways or developed areas.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In these and similar cases, railroads don't want blockages any more
than anyone else and already are incentivized to work diligently to
prevent them from occurring.
Ways Railroads Are Working to Reduce Grade Crossing Blockages
The reasons why blockages occur are varied, which is why railroads
use a variety of ways to try to reduce their prevalence.
One important way is to gather useful intelligence. Railroads work
with local officials, their own operating personnel, their customers,
and others to identify where and why blockages are occurring and to
develop counterstrategies to avoid foreseeable future problems.
Today, every public grade crossing has a 24/7 emergency phone
number and an identification number that callers can use to communicate
crossing-related issues with the owning railroad. Railroads use this
caller information, information from their operating teams, and
information gathered from other sources to help identify workable
short- and long-term solutions to blocked crossings.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

In addition, some railroads are partnering with technology
companies to develop dynamic signs that let motorists and first
responders know when a train is occupying a crossing so they can choose
a different route in advance. ``Estimated Wait Time'' signs are already
in use in some locations.
Information gathering and subsequent investigations sometimes
reveal that site-specific adjustments to operating practices are
feasible. For example, in cases where blockages are caused by trains
entering or exiting a customer facility, it is sometimes possible to
modify the time these activities take place to minimize blockages. Or,
in cases where trains stop to enable crew changes, it may be possible
to switch the crew change to locations with less potential conflict
with the public.
Changes to rail operating practices are not always feasible,
though. Rail customers, and the broader economy, depend on a rail
industry that is as safe, efficient, and cost effective as possible.
Railroads must be able to always take the big picture into account when
determining the best way to operate their networks, with the
understanding that railroads should always act in good faith in their
interactions with public officials and with the communities in which
they operate.
In some cases, railroads address grade crossing blockages through
new investments. For example, infrastructure investments such as
lengthening rail sidings or building new sidings to accommodate current
train lengths are undertaken to help prevent grade crossing blockages.
Blocked crossings can be eliminated if the crossing is closed or if
the crossing is grade separated by building either an underpass or an
overpass. When considered objectively, thousands of existing grade
crossings serve no significant transportation mobility or access
purpose. Many of these crossings remain open only because small but
vocal local opposition transforms what should be an objective
transportation safety and mobility decision into an emotional political
confrontation. Make no mistake, railroads are not saying that crossings
that experience blockages should simply be closed. Rather, when
evaluating how to minimize problems associated with any aspect of rail
operations, including blocked crossings, it's best to consider all
potential solutions. In some cases, closing a particular crossing might
be the best answer.
Likewise, even though grade separations can cost millions of
dollars for a single crossing, there are cases where they could be the
best answer to the problem of blocked crossings in locations with very
high train and/or motorist traffic.
I respectfully suggest that Congress could take steps to help
mitigate grade crossing blockages and other community impacts as part
of the FAST Act reauthorization. For example, in addition to at least
maintaining--or, better yet, increasing--dedicated funding for the
federal Section 130 program (which provides funds to eliminate hazards
at highway-rail grade crossings), Section 130 incentive payments for
grade crossing closures could be increased from the current cap of
$7,500 to $100,000. In addition, FAST reauthorization could enable or
incentivize states to bundle grade crossing projects into a single
grant application under applicable discretionary grant programs, such
as BUILD, INFRA or CRISI. Railroads also respectfully urge policymakers
to increase funding for these important discretionary grant
programs.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ Railroads respectfully suggest that, as part of the FAST Act
reauthorization, Congress consider other grade crossing-related policy
changes that would make crossings safer. For example, policymakers
should expand flexibility in the use of Section 130 funds by
eliminating the existing arbitrary 50 percent cap on spending for
hazard elimination projects, and by allowing Section 130 funds to be
used to replace functionally obsolete warning devices at crossings.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
As I noted in testimony to this committee on December 5, 2019,
recent years have been the safest in rail history, but creating an even
safer rail network requires a modernized approach to federal
regulations that allows railroads to innovate with new technologies and
processes. Unfortunately, the regulatory approach to rail safety today
is largely prescriptive and does not readily allow for the
incorporation of new technologies that would improve safety and
performance. Consequently, innovation is impeded because existing
designs, technology, and ways of thinking are largely ``locked in'' by
existing command-and-control regulations. A shift to a performance-
based approach--under which railroads would have discretion to test new
ways to improve safety, though they would still be subject to Federal
Railroad Administration (FRA) oversight--would mean rail safety would
be enhanced more effectively than is possible today.
There would be other additional benefits, though, of shifting from
a command-and-control to a performance-based safety regulatory regime.
One probable additional benefit would be fewer blocked crossings.
That's because some blocked crossings occur because railroads must
adhere to various FRA regulations before train movements can take
place. For example, today, FRA regulations require manual brake
inspections at intervals determined by mileage. However, technology
exists that can better measure actual braking performance. One example:
wheel temperature detectors that use infrared sensors to measure the
surface temperature of wheels passing the detectors. Using well-
developed algorithms, these temperature measurements determine whether
brakes on a railcar are working properly. ``Cold'' wheels could
indicate ineffective or inoperative brakes, while unusually ``hot''
wheels could indicate brakes that are sticking. The detectors measure
performance objectively, quantifiably, and independently of conditions
that can impair a visual inspection by a human (such as weather,
lighting, fatigue, inexperience, or error).
A modification of FRA regulations to allow more widespread use of
wheel temperature detectors in place of some manual brake tests
required by mileage would enhance safety, but it would have the
ancillary benefit of reducing the number of blocked crossings caused by
the inability to move trains until the manual brake tests are
performed.
This is just one example of the many cases where unnecessary and
outdated regulatory requirements negatively impact rail operations and
have negative spillover effects on the wider community. The public
would be better served by a regulatory system that looked forward
instead of backward and that encouraged innovation and the development
of new technologies that would make railroads safer and less prone to
negative community impacts.
Conclusion
To sum up, railroads are always seeking to minimize negative
impacts from their operations. Negative impacts are not good for the
communities in which railroads operate, and most of the time they
aren't good for railroads either. Railroads work closely with their own
operational teams, community leaders, government partners, first
responders, and the public to manage and mitigate blocked crossings
across the nation's rail network.

Letter:  Regarding Federal Funding for safety around railroad crossings
and right of ways

Dear Ranking Member Crawford,
My name is Chris Arvas and I serve as the State Coordinator of
Idaho Operation Lifesaver, Inc. I am writing you and The Subcommittee
on Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials on behalf of our
organization regarding Federal funding for Rail Crossing safety.
I am writing regarding the testimony presented to the House
Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials on
February 5, 2020 by Ms. Rachel Maleh from Operation Lifesaver Inc. and
by Jason Morris of the Norfolk Southern Corporation.
We agree with many of the points made during the testimony of Ms.
Maleh and Mr. Jason Morris. We rely upon and need the funding and
support of our many railroad crossing safety partners including the
FRA, FHWA and FTA. To lose any of this funding and support would be a
severe blow to our program and Rail Crossing Safety efforts. Currently,
Operation Lifesaver Inc. has determined that unless the state programs
sign a partnership agreement with them, we are not eligible for any
federal funds.
Idaho Operation Lifesaver along with a few other states have
declined to sign a partnership agreement which would essentially
subordinate our program to the wishes of Operation Lifesaver Inc. and
would eliminate our ownership of the name Idaho Operation Lifesaver
Inc. We ask that a funding formula of the allocated funds be designated
for state Operation Lifesaver programs not affiliated with Operation
Lifesaver Inc.
From the very beginning of the founding of Operation Lifesaver in
Idaho, the first in the nation, we have maintained a strong and
effective Rail Crossing Safety Program. Idaho was the first state to
have an Operation Lifesaver program which began in our state in 1972
and then spread in the following years to other states until now every
state in the Union has a program. The name Idaho Operation Lifesaver
was established by Idaho Law Enforcement at the Peace Officers
Association meeting in Coeur d'Alene Idaho at the inception of the
program.
Idaho Operation Lifesaver is a 501 C3 nonprofit and our safety
partners include:

The Idaho Chief of Police Association
The Idaho Sheriff's Association
Idaho State Police
Idaho Department of Transportation
Idaho Department of Education
Idaho Public Utilities Commission
Idaho Railroads
Idaho Community Volunteers

The work of the Idaho program is done by folks from the above
groups. These folks speak to over 100,000 people annually at
presentation, community events and state fairs regarding the potential
dangers that exist around railroad right of ways and railroad
crossings. We give presentations to groups ranging from preschool to
senior citizens with a special emphasis on student driver education
classes and professional drivers.
Operation Lifesaver Incorporated the National organization was
established in 1986 as a support and referral center for the various
state programs and has since morphed into an autocratic organization
that was not foreseen or anticipated at the time of its creation.
We feel that all states that have an established, effective and
active Operation Lifesaver program should share in federal funding, not
just those who are affiliated with Operation Lifesaver Incorporated.
We believe that the non-affiliated states should be able to apply
to the FRA, FHWA and FTA directly for their fair piece of the funding
pie.
We hope you will give our request due consideration. We appreciate
this opportunity to present our concerns and recommendations to the
subcommittee.
Sincerely,
Chris Arvas,
State Coordinator, Idaho
Operation Lifesaver.

Letter of February 14, 2020, from Vern Keeslar, Executive Director,
Utah Operation Lifesaver, Inc., Submitted for the Record by Hon. Eric
A. ``Rick'' Crawford
February 14, 2020.
Dear Chairman Lipinski, Ranking Member Crawford, and Members of the
Subcommittee,
Thank you for allowing public input on the testimony given at the
Hearing on Tracking Toward Zero: Improving Grade Crossing Safety and
Addressing Community Concerns from February 5, 2020.
My name is Vern Keeslar and I have been the Executive Director of
Utah Operation Lifesaver, Inc. for the past 16 years. Utah Operation
Lifesaver, a nonprofit 501 (c) (3), has been a constant and consistent
voice for highway-rail grade crossing safety and trespass prevention
education in Utah since 1976.
Utah Operation Lifesaver continues to perform public outreach and
education by providing presentations and educational material to the
following targeted audiences; elementary, junior high, and high school
students, driver education students, school bus drivers, professional
truck and bus drivers, first responders, and other community and civic
organizations. In fact, Utah is the only State in the country that
requires one hour of railroad crossing safety instruction be given in
public driver education classes!
I want to bring to your attention to a few items listed below
regarding Federal funding.
1.  Operation Lifesaver was first started as a grassroots safety
program in the State of Idaho in 1972.
2.  Operation Lifesaver, Inc. (OLI) was formed in 1986, originally
as a support and referral center for the established State Operation
Lifesaver programs.
3.  OLI receives Federal funding from the Federal Railroad
Administration (FRA), Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) all while being housed in the
offices of the Association of American Railroads (AAR)--a lobbying
organization for the freight railroads.
4.  OLI has terminated their partnership with Utah Operation
Lifesaver because we would not sign a subscription agreement with them
because we want to maintain our independent voice for rail safety
education in Utah. We are a rail safety education organization, not a
railroad organization!
5.  OLI has also informed Utah Operation Lifesaver in writing that
they are not eligible for these Federal grants from the FRA, FHWA, and
FTA even though it is Utah Operation Lifesaver that implements and
coordinates all rail safety outreach in Utah.
6.  If governmental Federal funding is being distributed by the
FRA, FHWA, and FTA to a nongovernmental organization, in this case OLI,
shouldn't all State rail safety programs be eligible for this funding?
According to OLI they are not. I wonder if the Administrators of the
FRA, FHWA, and FTA know that their funding is not being considered for
all States.

I am recommending a full investigation into this matter of OLI
playing favorites by not allowing Federal funding to be distributed to
all State rail safety programs.
Sincerely,
Vern Keeslar,
Executive Director, Utah

Inc.

Statement of Patrick Goddard, President, Virgin Trains USA Florida, LLC
(aka Brightline Trains), Submitted for the Record by Hon. Frederica S.
Wilson
Introduction
Chairman Lipinski, Ranking Member Crawford and members of the
subcommittee, my name is Patrick Goddard and I am the President of
Virgin Trains USA Florida, aka Brightline Trains. While I was not able
to participate in this hearing on grade crossing safety, I am pleased
to submit this statement for the record outlining our passenger rail
company's initiatives to address crossing safety along our South
Florida rail corridor.
Virgin Trains USA Florida (VTUSA), is a wholly owned subsidiary of
Florida East Coast Industries, LLC (FECI) a transportation,
infrastructure, and real-estate development company based at our
signature Virgin MiamiCentral station in downtown Miami.
Our passenger train subsidiary was established in 2012 to pursue
passenger rail opportunities on a private, for-profit basis. VTUSA is
the first major private passenger rail start-up effort in last 100
years and represents the return of intercity passenger rail on the
historic Florida East Coast Railway corridor.
FECI traces its roots to the late 1890's and the company founded by
Henry Flagler who first introduced an integrated rail network into
Florida. That railroad gave rise to the growth of most of what is now
the country's third largest state. Originally the system was built as a
railroad that carried passengers from points north to new development
projects along the Florida coastline, and also carried the freight to
support the needs of those people and of those building the communities
emerging along the new infrastructure backbone. FEC Railway supported
Flagler's chain of resort hotels stretching from St. Augustine to Key
West, including the famed Breakers, still owned and operated by today
by descendants of Flagler. In the late 1960's the passenger service
ceased operations, but the freight service continued to support the
growth of the state. After some 120 years of continuous operations, the
original railroad remains a profitable private enterprise.
In 2007, Fortress Investment Group (a New York based investment
management firm) acquired Florida East Coast Industries, which was at
the time a publicly traded company, and converted the assets into two
distinct private companies with interests divided between freight and
passenger railroad operations. In 2017, the freight operator, Florida
East Coast Railway, was sold by Fortress Investment Group and is no
longer part of the Fortress/FECI family of companies. However, Virgin
Trains and Florida East Coast Railway continue to operate along the
rail corridor under a permanent easement and Joint Use Agreement.

A Vision for Passenger Rail in America
Leveraging the legacy of the original company and its historic
assets, VTUSA is investing $4 billion of private capital toward the
reintroduction of passenger rail service to major Florida cities. This
express, intercity passenger train is a newly created, consumer-
oriented brand built to support an optimistic vision for what it means
to travel by train in America. VTUSA is being introduced in two phases.
Phase one service between Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach
began revenue operations in 2018, with phase two service extending from
West Palm Beach to Orlando International Airport currently under
construction. Service to Orlando is expected to begin service in 2022.
Phase three planning and design to Walt Disney World and Tampa is
underway.
Virgin Trains USA is also working to bring our transformative rail
system to other regions. We recently acquired the rights to build a
high-speed rail between Las Vegas and Southern California. Construction
is expected to begin late 2020. These new passenger systems are an all-
important first step toward the reintroduction of private passenger
rail in America, financed through private investment and with a vision
to connect major markets which are ``too long to drive and too short to
fly''.
Only six years since it was conceived, Virgin Trains is now
carrying customers in a fleet of new and innovative, biofuel powered
100% made in America trains. In 2019, our first year of full
operations, we safely carried more than one million passengers.

Safety by design
With safety our foremost goal, in the design and operation of this
passenger railroad we have incorporated the most advanced signaling and
safety technology available, including Positive Train Control.
Our existing railroad crossings have been significantly upgraded
with additional safety components and traffic warning systems under the
stringent supervision of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and
Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) in strict compliance with
the FRA Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Guidelines for High Speed Passenger
Rail. Conducted by a team of engineers from FRA, FDOT, VTUSA, and each
county and city public works department, every highway-railroad
crossing between Miami and Cocoa was subject to on-site inspection and
evaluation to determine the scope of improvements necessary for the
safe operation of higher speed passenger rail.
In the course of this evaluation, the FRA and FDOT determined that
they would require VTUSA to upgrade crossings to meet national ``Sealed
Corridor'' standards where speeds exceed 79 mph.
A major component of our commitment to safety was the restoration
of the previously removed second track that will allow for joint
freight and passenger use. The FEC Railway has always been considered
the gold standard for safety and for the early adoption of new
technologies, such as the addition of Automatic Train Control (ATC) in
the 1980's. ATC is a forerunner to PTC, which is currently being
installed and will be operational by the end of 2020 in phase one. PTC
will be fully installed in phase two by the time it begins service in
2022.
We are one of the early railroads that will utilize a new
technology, Vehicle Presence Detection (VPD), a warning system that
will automatically open an exit gate for a vehicle stopped on the track
while simultaneously warning an approaching train.
In South Florida, where speeds do not exceed 79 mph, our trains
began testing in 2017 with revenue service commencing in 2018 under the
Brightline brand. During our two years of operations we have moved over
1.7 million people safely. Commensurate with this service, we've taken
an aggressive approach to safety by launching safety awareness
campaigns, focused on education . . . engineering . . . and
enforcement.
We are experimenting with new technologies and engaging in an
ongoing education program, distributing materials to the local schools
and working with influencers and local celebrities to sign our rail
safety pledge.
Trespassing on the Tracks
Since a year prior to launching operations, Brightline engaged in a
tri-lingual safety education campaign in the South Florida area. In
2017, prior to Brightline's launch of service Florida saw a ten year
high in railroad fatalities totally 64. The past two years, fatalities
rates actually gone down. Unfortunately, we still see incidents along
the corridor. To be clear, not a single incident on our railroad has
been due to a failure of safety systems associated with this rail
service. Those who have been injured or tragically died have either
ignored warning signals by circumventing the safety equipment designed
to protect them or by committing suicide.
Too many people take unnecessary chances with their lives, ignoring
warning signals attempting to drive around the gate or to run across
the tracks. These actions are dangerous and illegal, and they put other
lives at risk. Our public education efforts focus on asking members of
the public to treat train crossings like red lights or stop signs and
to pay attention around the track.
Train fatalities pale in comparison to automobile incidents. In
2018, the state of Florida had over 3,100 auto-related fatalities from
a total of over 400,000 auto incidents. Florida also saw nearly 150
bicycle related fatalities.
These fatalities can also be considered in the context of other
traffic safety risks. In 2018 (the most recent year available), the
Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles reported 725
fatalities from motor vehicle crashes in the three counties served by
Brightline: Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach. 201 pedestrian
fatalities were reported in these three counties in 2018.
Dividing the number of motor vehicle crash fatalities in these
three counties by the number of annual vehicle miles traveled results
in a motor vehicle fatal crash rate. Factoring the fatalities and
vehicle miles traveled for these three counties for the three years of
2016 through 2018 results in a motor vehicle fatal crash rate of 4.99
fatalities per million vehicle miles traveled. Using 2019 Brightline
ridership figures (total of 1,012,804) and allocating across the three
city pairs of service (FLL-MIA, FLL-WPB, and MIA-WPB) produces a
Passenger Miles Traveled measure (defined by the Federal Transit
Administration's National Transit Database). This calculation results
in 47,541,020 passenger miles traveled in 2019. Applying the average
fatal crash rate to this measure of intercity passenger rail travel can
approximate the relative risk of fatal crashes not experienced by
Brightline passengers in these three counties. This calculation
estimates that 237 fewer crash fatalities by intercity passenger rail
trips in 2019 in these three counties.\1\

Analysis Division Head, Texas A&M Transportation Institute, January
2020.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Based on all numbers available, train travel is safer than cars.
However, we are committed to do more to prevent these types of
incidents. To protect the public, we are engaged in several new
initiatives, including:

Utilizing drones to patrol the railroad corridor and
alert local authorities when trespassers or potential suicide victims
are spotted on the corridor

Installing additional fencing or natural barriers in
certain areas where active trespassing is occurring

Installing additional crossing warning and safety systems
such as additional gates or delineators to deter drivers who might
consider going around gates

Installing Active Warning Signs . . . digital messaging
signs and ``Moving Eyes'' which provide pedestrian and vehicular
warnings. These signs remind pedestrians and drivers to look both ways
prior to crossing. The dynamic or active message sign is interconnected
with the railroad signal system and remains dark until it receives an
alert that a train is approaching. This triggers the active message
sign to display its warning messages.

Working with Florida Department of Transportation to add
``dynamic envelopes'' at crossings, a reflective, bold striping on the
pavement to prevent vehicles from stopping on or too close to crossings

Working with FDOT and state and local law enforcement
agencies, including the Florida Highway Patrol, sheriffs, and police
chiefs, to help enforce rail safety laws

Virgin Trains will participate with the Federal Railroad
Administration in a May 2020 Regional workshop on Right of Way
Trespassing in West Palm Beach, FL.
Suicide
While many incidents are due to reckless behavior at crossings, a
higher number have been due to people taking their own lives. The
majority of our incidents have involved individuals that have been
impaired by drugs or alcohol or have been as a result of suicide. This
estimation is based on a compilation of data obtained from Medical
Examiner conclusions and autopsy toxicology reports, eyewitness
accounts as observed by on-board train personnel, video records from
on-board cameras, and narrative incident descriptions as reported to
the Federal Railroad Administration under 49 CFR Part 225. This in an
industry-wide concern. Suicide rates have increased more than 30% in
the last 15 years. Florida's suicide rate is higher than the national
average. Suicide by rail is a growing problem that should be addressed
in another forum in the context of mental health issues and opioid
abuse.
To address this problem locally, VTUSA recently formed a
collaboration with a major South Florida mental health and suicide
prevention organization to raise awareness of local help programs to
intervene and direct those considering suicide to counseling and mental
health programs.
Major components of this program include signage at railroad
crossings directing people in crisis to the ``211 Helpline'' where
counselors will engage with them and find them the help they need. The
program will focus on homeless, low income and at-risk populations near
South Florida railroad corridors where suicide rates are higher.
Services include disseminating information about 211 Helpline and
mental health and counseling services through events and outreach in
targeted communities. The program will also utilize PSA's, print and
social media and include outreach to school children.
Education
Be assured, Virgin Trains is not content with simply accepting
injuries and deaths when people trespass on active railroads or ignore
warning signals. We have taken extraordinary extra steps to educate the
public about safe behavior around railroads and to explore additional
ways to reduces incidents.
Since Virgin Trains began service in January of 2018, we have added
a number of initiatives to our ongoing safety campaign, including:

Placing Variable Message Signs (VMS) at major crossings
with warning messages about new train activity

Working with Operation Lifesaver, training 40+ teammates
as authorized Operation Lifesaver Volunteers

Broadcasting over 1000 public service announcements on TV
and Radio

Deploying Teammates at major highway-railroad crossings
to meet with pedestrians, hand out flyers in nearby businesses, and
engage and educate our South Florida communities about the importance
of staying safe around active railroad tracks

Conducting more 40 emergency response seminars, training
more than 350 First Responders in 18 fire and police departments

Working jointly with the Palm Beach State College Fire
Academy developing an ongoing training curriculum and holding full
scale emergency response exercises.

Mailing 92,000 safety pamphlets to families with school-
age children. School children are given pledge cards where they pledge
to never walk or bike along tracks, cross tracks when a train is moving
and to ``b'' safe near railroads

Training 500 bus drivers about train activity and safe
driving near tracks

Employing off-duty police at key crossings to step up
enforcement of trespassing laws

Working with local cities, installing additional safety
features where feasible.

Our most innovative awareness education initiative received a 2019
Rail Safety Certificate of Merit from APTA. Known as the Buzz Boxx,
this unique safety campaign is a mobile Barber Shop that we place at
homeless organizations and youth centers. In exchange for taking a rail
safety pledge, we provide a free haircut. We also provide mental health
counselors at certain venues. Partnering with more than a dozen law
enforcement and community service agencies, the Buzz Boxx is an
effective and unique way to engage kids and teach them about safety
around railroads and raise awareness.

What can Congress do?
In considering new programs to prevent trespassing, we urge
Congress to provide additional funding for programs that provide for
more aggressive enforcement of trespassing and disobeying crossing
signals, including increased penalties.
Congress should explore ways to limit liability claims against
private railroads due to damaged or missing fences.
Maintenance of fencing over hundreds of miles is costly and
difficult to manage. Numerous studies have shown that widespread
installation is impractical and often ineffective as those determined
to trespass will vandalize, damage or otherwise destroy them in order
to restore the unfettered access they were previously accustomed to. In
such case railroads are vulnerable to lawsuits for injury to
trespassers who gain entry through a damaged fence.
Increase funding for crossing grade separation programs, crossing
safety infrastructure, fencing and other barrier systems to prevent
unauthorized access to rail corridors.
With the growing emergence of private sector passenger rail in the
U.S., we also urge Congress to make private passenger rail companies
eligible for crossing safety and trespass prevention grant programs
which currently allow only public agencies to apply.
Conclusion
VTUSA is operating on a rail corridor that has been in continuous
use since 1895, private property on which VTUSA and Florida East Coast
Railway share ownership. Having spent more than $2 billion dollars to
date, none of which are taxpayer funds, we are committed to completing
this rail system to Orlando and then Tampa, making real a long-sought
Florida dream to give our 20 million residents and 115 million visitors
an alternative to crowded highways.
As we continue work on the expansion of our system, we invite each
member of this committee and others interested to visit our operations
in Florida and to meet with those directly involved with the safety and
security of our railroad. We have designed a thorough and complete set
of initiatives focused on education, engineering and enforcement and a
first-hand look is critical.
Thank you for the opportunity to submit our comments.

Questions from Hon. Peter A. DeFazio to Karl Alexy, Associate
Administrator for Railroad Safety and Chief Safety Officer, Federal
Railroad Administration

Question 1. When Administrator Batory testified before the
Subcommittee in June, he stated that some trains can measure as long as
16,000 feet.
a.)  Does the FRA collect data on train lengths? In the case that
FRA does not collect data on train lengths, has FRA studied potential
safety problems at various lengths? If so, please share your research
with the Committee.
Answer. FRA does not directly regulate train length, and as such,
FRA does not collect comprehensive data on train length. However, FRA
does require railroads to report certain information when reporting
accidents/incidents. For all reportable accidents/incidents, FRA
requires the involved railroads to report the number of cars in the
train, but not the train length itself. Although cars are manufactured
in various lengths, knowing the number of cars can produce an estimate
of the train's overall length.
As noted in GAO's May 2019 Report (Report No. GAO-19-443), ``Rail
Safety: Freight Trains Are Getting Longer, and Additional Information
Is Needed to Assess Their Impact,'' FRA, through its Office of
Research, Development, & Technology (RDT), is currently evaluating the
braking performance of longer trains (i.e., freight trains with 150-to-
250 railcars), with technical feedback and collaboration with the
industry. FRA's study includes evaluations of the train dynamics of
operating longer trains. See GAO Report at 22-26. That study is on-
going, with a target of completing the first phase of the study by the
end of 2020 and the second phase by the end of 2021. The phases of the
study are described in the GAO report. See GAO Report at 23, Table 1.
In addition, through FRA's comprehensive safety program, the agency
continually assesses railroad safety performance through data analysis,
simulation, inspections, audits, and accident investigations. FRA has,
in-house, two simulators that evaluate train performance, taking into
consideration the number and types of cars in the train, train makeup
(i.e., the location of car types within the train), and brake
performance, as well as the physical characteristics of the route.
These simulators are being used to support FRA's study. If FRA has
reason to believe the length of the train or train makeup was a factor
in an accident/incident, FRA evaluates that issue during its accident
investigation, including simulation.

b.)  Is the FRA confident that braking systems, end-of-train
devices, and distributed power units can consistently communicate over
the length of trains, including those that can run up to 16,000 feet
long?
i.)  If so, what data has been gathered by the FRA to support
this?
ii.)  Up to what distance do braking systems, end-of-train
devices, distributed power units, and handheld radios generally
transmit properly? Up to what distance do they generally transmit in
mountainous terrain?
iii.)  Can you provide that research to this Committee?
Answer b.)i.) through b.)iii.). The ability of braking systems,
end-of-train devices, distributed power units, and handheld radios to
communicate over the length of trains is affected by several factors.
For example, surrounding terrain (e.g., mountains and valleys) and
structures may impact the systems' ability to consistently communicate
over the length of a train. To better understand how various factors
affect the ability of these systems to maintain communications and what
operational and technological solutions exist to ensure communications
are maintained, FRA, in a notice of proposed rulemaking published on
January 15, 2020, requested data related to: (1) the frequency and
duration of communications losses; (2) what operational and
technological solutions for communication losses the industry has
considered and implemented; and (3) how and when an emergency signal
should be sounded or other notification sent to a locomotive engineer
when a loss of communications has occurred. 85 FR 2494. FRA is using
all relevant data and information received in response to this request
for information to inform its future actions on this issue.
In the meantime, FRA requires railroads to comply with federal rail
safety regulations that specify the minimum requirements for the safe
use of braking systems, end-of-train devices, and radio and wireless
communications. FRA's regulations are designed so that a properly
performed brake test should provide the necessary safety assurances
that the brakes will work as intended until the next required brake
inspection. Moreover, FRA's regulations specify actions that must be
taken when radio communications and end-of-train devices and such
systems fail to work properly. See 49 CFR Part 220, Subpart B, and 49
CFR Part 232, Subpart E.
Distributed power units are locomotives and are regulated under
FRA's regulation on locomotive safety standards. See 49 CFR Part 229.
The number and placement of distributed power units within a train
consist impacts the quality of brake signal transmissions throughout
the train consist. A distributed power locomotive, in the middle of a
train consist, effectively acts as a repeater of the brake signal
transmission from the controlling locomotive to the rear of the train,
which enhances the ability to maintain communication between the front
and rear of the train through a variety of circumstances. (Distributed
power locomotives have the added advantage of helping to control in-
train lateral forces, depending on where they are located in the train
consist). For example, operations under an FRA test waiver (Docket No.
FRA-2016-0086 at www.regulations.gov) have demonstrated that even in
cold weather conditions, when it takes longer to pressurize air brake
systems and trains are more prone to air brake leakage, a distributed
power equipped train can withstand leakage at 50% more air flow than a
conventional train and still have compliant brake performance. The
distributed power locomotive reduces the time required to pressurize
the air brake system throughout the train consist, despite train
length, allowing the brakes to effectively function despite the brake
pipe leakage. In the final phases of the FRA RDT study, FRA will study
distributed power quantity and placement in longer trains.

Hon. Ronald L. Batory,
Administrator,
Federal Railroad Administration, United States Department of
Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE, Washington, DC.

Dear Administrator Batory:
I write in response to your May 16, 2019 letters addressed to Carl
Ice, BNSF Chief Executive Officer, and me regarding the issue of
blocked highway-rail grade crossings and your request for our
assistance in this matter. As you outline in your letter, blocked
crossings are a recognized area of concern within some of the
communities where we operate and BNSF is always concerned about the
potential impact to public safety and quality of life in those
communities. BNSF is pleased to work further with the Federal Railroad
Administration (FRA) on this matter, as requested in your letter.
At BNSF, we have been and will continue to be committed to the
practices discussed in your letter, as well as other efforts to
mitigate and prevent road and rail traffic conflict where it is within
our ability to improve outcomes. Given increased vehicular traffic near
the rail network, the problem is often more complex than railroad
operating practices. Therefore, BNSF appreciates the comprehensive
approach that the Department of Transportation (DOT) is taking on this
matter.
As context to overall grade crossing safety at BNSF, BNSF has the
lowest highway-rail grade crossing collision rate in the industry,
reducing the rate of grade crossing collisions over 70% since the
creation of BNSF in 1995. Much of BNSF's success is the product of
grade crossing safety programs and processes which, like much of the
industry, are centered around engineering, enforcement and education.
Included in these efforts has been the elimination of over 6,400
highway-railroad grade crossings on BNSF since 2000. While BNSF's
efforts have consistently resulted in industry low incident rates, 2019
is producing historical lows in both grade crossing and trespasser
incident rates. The well-established corporate grade crossing programs
and processes, coupled with strong community, public safety officer and
responder outreach will continue to guide us in this area. Although we
are proud of this history, BNSF's focus is the path to zero--an
imperative that supports our safety vision of an incident and injury-
free operation.
These grade crossing safety practices are an important part of the
multi-pronged approach that BNSF takes to addressing blocked crossings.
Our approach consists of an ongoing effort to understanding which
crossings are vulnerable to blockage as well as when and why. We apply
significant planning tools and practices to operations, which I will
discuss further below. In addition, BNSF's current operating rules seek
to minimize occupation of a crossing under any operating scenario or
unnecessarily activating automatic warning devices at crossings.
Blocked crossings, nevertheless, can result from a variety of
operating activities and conditions. BNSF's ongoing review indicates
that addressing unplanned train stoppages has significant leverage in
avoiding blocked crossings. In short, BNSF's technology and operational
programs designed to improve the reliability of our track and
mechanical infrastructure directly affects its success with avoiding
blocked crossings. BNSF has improved rail equipment incident rates by
nearly 50% since 2000. Important to those efforts is our continued
effective collaboration with the FRA in areas such as our automated
track inspection pilot and brake health effectiveness waiver, among
others. We know that the DOT is aware of BNSF's commitment to further
the use and reliance upon these technologies--which not only improve
safety, but provide the opportunity to improve operational and
maintenance planning and, therefore, network fluidity.
Dispatcher training is also an important element of BNSF's
operational approach to avoiding and mitigating blocked crossings on
the network. Dispatchers are familiarized with public crossing
locations and trained to minimize blocking these crossings as they
operationalize siding utilization and meet/pass opportunities,
opportunities for train stopping points, and clearance points and the
distance between identified locations, including public crossings.
Dispatchers plan operations to provide the most efficient train
movement with the least impact to crossing operations. Likewise, BNSF's
crew planning process is designed to include information on relevant
public crossings as an important consideration in locating crew change
points. Ultimately, there is specific focus on this issue at every
level--at the department level, at each operating division, and with
individual employees at the local level.
Finally, BNSF relies on its employees and the communities we serve
to provide the company ongoing awareness of when conditions develop on
the network and a public crossing is blocked. Like other railroads,
BNSF utilizes a 1-800 emergency contact number which is broadly shared
with the public and posted at all public grade crossings to contact the
BNSF 24-hour Resource Operations Center with crossing related concerns.
When a situation develops real-time, BNSF operations acts with urgency
and part of that process includes ensuring appropriate contacts are
made and lines of communication are open. Many times providing a local
level of engagement and access helps to alleviate a blocked crossing
situation. Where there is the potential for an ongoing chronic
condition, we look at whether longer-term ongoing remediation plans can
be put into place--for example, an operational change identified by
local BNSF operating leadership, or working with local emergency
responders to identify road crossing alternatives. BNSF has found that,
in most cases, the best way to address these concerns is to engage
local BNSF teams to coordinate with the community.
BNSF regularly assesses its existing processes, procedures and
controls related to blocked highway-rail grade crossings. We will
continue to do that and provide your staff insight into that process. I
further commit to you that we will work with interested local
communities and the Department of Transportation where grade separation
opportunities present themselves. BNSF encourages public policies that
support these projects where appropriate.
We appreciate you reaching out to us and partnering with us in this
important area. I look forward to working with you and your team as we
continue to provide safe, reliable and efficient transportation
services.
Sincerely,
Katie Farmer,
Executive Vice President, Operations.
CSX Corporation,
500 Water St., C900,
Jacksonville, FL 32202, June 24, 2019.
Mr. Ronald L. Batory,
Administrator,
U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Railroad Administration,
1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE, Washington, DC.

Dear Mr. Batory:
I am responding to your recent letter concerning blocked highway-
rail grade crossings across the United States.
Your letter requested CSX Transportation assess its operations to
minimize blocked highway-rail grade crossings across its network. CSX
continuously reviews its operations to determine how best to avoid
disruptions caused by blocked crossings and has taken many steps to
alleviate such issues. For example, CSX's operating rules include
specific instructions that standing trains and switching movements
should avoid blocking highway-rail grade crossings. Our train crews and
dispatchers also understand the need to regularly communicate with one
another about blocked crossings when trains are stopped or delayed and
take additional steps (including, at times, separating the train) to
minimize the impact to motor-vehicle traffic at these locations.
Furthermore, our Network Operations team regularly reviews trains that
have stopped to determine if additional assistance is required to avoid
any disruptions to the public and surrounding communities.
You also ask that CSX consider train lengths and locations when
stopping trains could potentially occupy a crossing or impede traffic.
Regardless of train size, our Network Operations team carefully plans
where our trains meet with one another to avoid such issues, including
taking into consideration nearby sidings or timing such meets to reduce
disruptions when other viable alternatives are limited. When necessary,
we also identify locations in our timetables that additionally instruct
crews to avoid occupying a specific crossing (or crossings) with a
standing train or a train engaged in switching.
Finally, you encourage CSX to engage with state and local
governments to discuss blocked-crossing issues and work to mitigate
community-specific impacts. CSX's Operations and Public Affairs teams
often engage state and local officials across our network to address
community concerns. Our teams work directly with local officials to
develop a workable solution to mitigate blocked crossings, solutions
that have included crossing re-location or removal, operational changes
and infrastructure investments. In fact, just recently CSX worked with
local representatives in Fairport, New York where CSX rescheduled its
operations to commence at midnight in an effort to avoid blocked
crossings during the day.
In addition to the above steps, the efficiency gains achieved by
CSX has further helped reduce blocked highway-rail grade crossings
across our network. Increased velocity, reductions in terminal dwell
and a decrease in the number of cars on line all result in less
crossing disruptions. As a result, CSX is currently on track to receive
approximately 30% less blocked crossing complaints then it did in 2018.
Nevertheless, and as suggested in your letter, CSX will continue to
assess its operations and engage with its Operations team and the
communities across our network to further mitigate highway-rail grade
crossing issues.
Please feel free to contact me should you have any additional
questions or concerns.
Sincerely,
James M. Foote,
President and Chief Executive Officer.

Re: KCS Efforts to Minimize Blocked Crossings

Dear Administrator Batory:
Our Chief Executive Officer Pat Ottensmeyer asked me to respond to
your recent letter highlighting the Federal Railroad Administration's
(``FRA's'') attention to the issue of blocked at-grade crossings, and
requesting that The Kansas City Southern Railway Company (``KCS'') re-
examine its operations to avoid crossing blocking. I am happy to report
that KCS is making strides to address this issue.
Like FRA, KCS is acutely aware that blocked grade crossings can be
a point of friction between the railroad and the communities where we
operate. KCS tries to be a good neighbor in the communities where we
operate, and we have worked with many communities on crossing blocking
issues. Sometimes this has involved bearing costs of improving some
crossings while paying communities to close others. In one instance we
have conferred with a community about installing a detection system at
a crossing that the community felt was especially critical to its
cross-town emergency vehicle and school bus traffic. The system would
provide an advance notice to drivers several blocks from the crossing
that could have allowed them to divert to other routes if the crossing
was occupied. In another community we modified our operation so that
trains would be held outside town if the railroad swing bridge on the
other end of town needed to open to let river tows pass. Nevertheless,
as the communities around our lines and yards continue to grow, their
vehicular traffic increases and new streets are built, and as our own
traffic grows, new challenges arise continually. Sometimes we simply
have to apologize to our neighbors and tell them that we will try to do
better.
I am pleased to tell you that, spurred by your letter to Mr.
Ottensmeyer, KCS is taking further steps to track and assess blocked
crossing reports. We have recently instituted a system for cataloging
and handling blocked crossing calls received by our Critical Incident
Desk (CID). Each time a call comes in, the Coordinator, whose office is
in our central dispatching center, will make contact with the
dispatcher or yard handling operations at the location of concern to
determine additional facts about the situation, and will provide
feedback to the caller about the situation and what we know about when
it will resolve. In some instances, we have heard even while we are on
the phone with the caller that the blockage is resolving. Call
information is regularly reviewed by our operating and health & safety
teams.
Call information thus far shows several common causes of blocked
crossings, some of which should be manageable and some that are random
or beyond our control. In the former category are train meets and
trains being held out of a yard unexpectedly, sometimes by us and
sometimes by our interchange partners. In the latter category are
problems like equipment breakdowns, short-notice bridge openings for
river traffic to pass, and even a tie fire on the track. Often the
complaint involves industry switching, an activity that obviously must
occur and that has to be scheduled when the shipper is able to receive
the traffic. We have seen repeat problems at a couple of crossings, and
so will be looking into those more intensively to see what can be done.
We are working to develop the best systematic way of using blocked
crossing information to help avoid foreseeable future problems. Whether
that requires discussions with teams in our operating department to
develop a set of best practices and best alternatives or whether it
requires site-specific adjustments of an operating pattern remains to
be seen. Both may be helpful.
Thank you for your leadership on this issue and for motivating KCS
to do more to be a good neighbor to the communities where we operate. I
am confident that your encouragement to us to increase attention to
crossing blocking will pay dividends for KCS and for the cities and
towns where we operate.
Sincerely,
Jeff Songer,
EVP & Chief Operations Officer.
Norfolk Southern Corporation,
Three Commercial Place,
Norfolk, Virginia 23510-2191, July 9, 2019.
Mr. Ronald L. Batory,
Administrator,
Federal Railroad Administration, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE,
Washington, DC.

Dear Administrator Batory:
I appreciate this opportunity to respond to your letter regarding
complaints about blocked crossings. Norfolk Southern (``NS'') addresses
grade crossing safety, railroad trespassing prevention, and community
concerns over blocked crossings in a very proactive manner. Norfolk
Southern's approach to each of these issues is built on working
collaboratively with the communities in which we operate and the
customers we serve.
Over the next several decades, America's transportation system
faces a doubling of freight volumes. The demands on railroads to meet
this challenge will require a financially stable industry that can
invest in new technologies which enhance safety, improve productivity,
and create operational efficiency. In light of these trends Norfolk
Southern has undertaken a dedicated approach to working with state
transportation departments, state legislatures, and local elected
officials. This new focus on creating state programs that seek to
eliminate redundant crossings while also grade separating where
appropriate will, we believe, provide the most benefits for all
stakeholders.
The creation of novel programs to fund grade separations and road
redesign, which enhance surface transportation mobility, has also been
a primary concentration. Our efforts have been focused on our heaviest
volume routes that tend to experience the largest number of crossing
impacts in communities on our lines. In 2015, Norfolk Southern
proactively began to work with the State of Indiana to foster a model
grade crossing safety program centered on a corridor approach. In 2018,
eight local governments along NS mainlines were awarded projects
through Indiana DOT's Local TRAX Program. More information about the
program can be found at: https://www.in.gov/indot/files/
Local%20TRAX%20Presentation%20.pdf.
In 2019, NS began the effort to take the model Indiana program to
other states along our Chicago line. I am pleased to report that the
states of Illinois, Michigan, and Ohio are very interested in this new
approach, and NS has or will soon be approaching numerous communities
in these states concerning projects that support closing redundant
crossings and grade separating additional crossings. In some instances
these projects have been identified using data indicating significant
positive impacts for motorists. In Ohio, for example, we are already
working with Ohio Rail Development Commission and ODOT to begin the
process to grade separate a crossing in Cleveland identified by FRA in
2016 as one of the fifteen most dangerous at-grade crossings.
The best solutions for providing predictable mobility at grade
crossings require a shared vision and can take years to construct.
Norfolk Southern is a willing partner to discuss these opportunities
with any community who is seeking a long term solution to at-grade
crossings. In a few instances Norfolk Southern has partnered with
communities through the FRA's CRISI Grant Program. We are a strong
proponent for expanding this program, and we appreciate working with
the FRA and grant recipients on these meaningful partnerships.
Finally, I would also like to ask for your assistance in helping to
modernize the Section 130 Railway-Highway Crossing Program. Norfolk
Southern is a strong proponent of this best in class safety program.
While this program is under the sole jurisdiction of the Federal
Highway Administration, I wanted to share with you our team's ideas on
some changes we think will make it even better. These changes include
the following; 1) increasing the current limit of $7,500 for incentive
payments to localities for the closing of a grade crossing to $100,000;
2) adding eligibility of Section 130 funds for the replacement of
functionally obsolete warning devices, and 3) increasing the federal
match for small or rural communities to 100%.
Norfolk Southern is deeply focused on safety where highways and
railways cross. Our customers also depend on NS to operate a safe,
efficient and high velocity network, which includes avoiding
operational impediments such as trains stopped on mainline tracks.
Enhancing the safe movement of goods and providing for an efficient
transportation system benefits transportation providers, communities,
and customers alike.
Sincerely,
James A. Squires,
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.

Union Pacific Corporation
1400 Douglas Street, 19th Floor,
Omaha, NE 68179, June 7, 2019.
Hon. Ronald Batory,
Administrator,
Federal Railroad Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation,
1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE, Washington, DC.
Dear Administrator Batory:
Thank you for your May 16, 2019, letter regarding blocked crossing
complaints. Union Pacific shares FRA's mission to enable the safe,
reliable and efficient movement of goods, now and in the future. Our
industry succeeds--and our communities, employees and customers
benefit--when our trains are moving.
As you know, we operate a highly interconnected network covering 23
states. Events in one location can sometimes impact the efficient flow
of trains hundreds of miles away. For these and other reasons, a
blocked crossing may feel local but is actually often the result of a
distant or more complex operational issue. Sometimes weather,
locomotives or railcar mechanical failures, and other unforeseen
interruptions to operations can cause a crossing to be blocked for an
unexpected duration. As you acknowledge in your letter, sometimes
trains stop to comply with federal regulations, such as brake tests and
equipment inspections.
Despite these obstacles, we must do better. We are cognizant of the
negative impacts blocked crossings have on communities, and we are
sensitive to their concerns. Union Pacific's public affairs team works
tirelessly with state and local officials to listen to their concerns
and create collaborative solutions that minimize impacts on surrounding
vehicle traffic. We also assist state and local road authorities with
their highway rail crossing assessment and improvement plans. These
plans help identify crossings that are good candidates for
improvements, closure and grade separation. In addition to these
efforts, Union Pacific has made significant crossing infrastructure
investments and improvements to promote safety and mitigate local
community concerns.
More remains to be done. I will emphasize with my operating team
that, in the development and execution of our transportation plan, we
will scrutinize how our operations affect local communities, and we
must make every operational effort to minimize blocked crossings.
Moreover, if Union Pacific knows in advance of an operational issue
that may significantly affect a community, our Response Management
Communication Center (RMCC) dispatchers will work with local emergency
dispatchers to eliminate imminent safety concerns.
We appreciate the open dialogue with the FRA regarding this issue,
and we will continue to monitor our blocked crossing data and other
risk identification tools to determine any safety mitigation or
operational modifications that will allow us to develop enduring
solutions to these issues. If you have further questions or concerns,
please do not hesitate to contact me.
Sincerely,
Lance M. Fritz,
Chairman, President, and CEO.

Questions from Hon. Randy K. Weber, Sr., to Karl Alexy, Associate
Administrator for Railroad Safety and Chief Safety Officer, Federal
Railroad Administration

Question 1. With five ports in my district, railroads are a
critical mode of transportation, with hundreds of train cars moving
goods from all over the world to distribution points further inland,
while also facilitating an explosion of exports to overseas
destinations. At the same time, these same trains can present
challenges to our local communities.
Galveston, Texas is a case in point.
In addition to significant freight activity at the port, Galveston
is also the fourth busiest cruise ship homeport in the United States.
There are only two primary emergency evacuation routes from the City of
Galveston: Broadway Avenue (Texas State Highway 87) and Harborside
Drive. Lengthy train delays occur on one of these two critical routes
from Galveston Island. Trains blocking Harborside Drive greatly impact
public safety by eliminating half the primary available routes to and
from the Island. The railroad companies using the associated tracks are
Union Pacific Railroad and BNSF Railway.
According to city officials, the railroads are increasing their
extended blocking of Harborside Drive for durations reaching or
exceeding 30 minutes. These blockages of the roadway occur at early
morning, during the evening commute, and many times throughout the day.
Delays impact commerce at the port, as well as port cruise operations.
More specifically, Harborside Drive is a main artery to the
University of Texas Medical Branch. The route is used by emergency
vehicles daily.
Local administrators have complained that communication with the
rail operators has not been easy; moreover, there does not appear to be
any method to contact on-the-ground supervisory personnel for the
railroads in Galveston. For example, one of the operators experienced a
derailment near 77th Street, but there was no communication from the
railroad to the city's public safety personnel.
As noted above, increased rail activity on the island--while
reflective of a booming economy--may pose risks to public safety. The
blocking of city streets and state highways, along with the
transportation and storage (siding) of hazardous materials, heightens
the risk to the general public.
While grade-separation projects are the most effective method to
address blockages and improve safety, these are costly projects and may
not always be fiscally or logistically realistic for the local
community. Although other federal and state transportation funding can
also be applied, grade crossing improvements--especially costly grade
separation projects--must compete against a wide range of critical
transportation needs. With these concerns in mind, the Section 130
Highway-Rail Crossing Safety Program provides states with federal
formula funds to eliminate hazards posed by blocked grade crossings due
to idling trains.
What protocols are in place to ensure that the railroads notify
local first responders of all derailments, including what types of
hazardous materials are being stored and/or transported through the
City?
Answer. All railroads have protocols in place to notify local first
responders and, in certain instances, the National Response Center
(NRC) of any derailments and other rail accidents and/or incidents. FRA
regulations require railroads to immediately report certain types of
accidents and incidents to the NRC. 49 CFR Sec.  225.9. The NRC then
notifies applicable state and Federal agencies to assist in a
collective response to mitigate risk to the public.
Regarding hazardous materials, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials
Safety Administration (PHMSA), and the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) have regulatory requirements that mandate the reporting of
hazardous materials incidents to local, State, and Federal authorities.
PHMSA's requirement is found at 49 CFR Sec.  171.15and EPA's
requirement is found at 40 CFR Sec.  300.125. As part of its regulatory
oversight responsibility, FRA, in conjunction with other Federal
authorities, conducts follow-up with response organizations to ensure
reporting and information sharing is taking place with the freight
carriers.
Communicating information to communities and first responders
regarding high-hazard flammable trains transported and/or stored in
their jurisdictions is required under PHMSA regulations. 49 CFR Sec.
174.312. Additionally, a railroad is required to provide contact
information to local emergency planning and first responders to request
information regarding commodity flow information used to assess risk
and develop emergency action plans. 49 CFR Sec.  172.820.

Question 2. Does the FRA have any plans to alleviate use
restrictions--such as the requirement that 50 percent of the Section
130 program funds must be spent on protective devices--that impede a
state's ability to select more grade-separation projects or other
innovative projects?
Answer. The Section 130 Program is administered by the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA), not FRA. In addition, statute requires
at least 50% of Section 130 program funds to be used for protective
devices. 23 U.S.C. Sec.  130(e)(1)(B). A legislative change is required
to alleviate this restriction within the Section 130 Program.

Question 3. Does the FRA have any plans and/or recommendations for
greater federal program flexibility to fund innovative approaches to
significantly mitigate, if not eliminate, blocked railroad crossings?
Answer. FRA is working with industry and communities to identify
and evaluate low-cost measures to mitigate the consequences of blocked
crossings (e.g., new technology to communicate crossing status to
motorists or emergency services). The City of Hattiesburg, Mississippi,
was awarded a Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements
(CRISI) grant to use technology to communicate crossing status to
motorists. By partnering with a private company, Trainfo, the City of
Hattiesburg will install equipment to detect the presence, direction,
and length of trains. Algorithms will be developed to determine which
crossings will be blocked ahead of the train and for how long. This
information will be shared with motorists through mobile mapping
applications and dynamic message signs along the roadways. Although
this will be the first use of such a system in the United States,
Trainfo has successfully worked with local agencies in Canada on
similar systems already in use.
Another solution is the innovative use of variable message signs.
In Kirkwood, Missouri, and in Springfield, Massachusetts, electronic
message signs are illuminated that direct motorists to nearby
overpasses when trains are present at frequently blocked crossings.
In Houston, Texas, the police department started a ``mobility
committee'' to mitigate impacts of blocked crossings. Representatives
from the city, police department, and railroads meet monthly to discuss
issues related to blocked crossings and potential solutions. The city
of Houston also plans on deploying a camera system in the future to
monitor blocked crossing hot spots.
In addition, FRA's blocked crossing data is shared with our
stakeholders. Communities can use the information to plan emergency
service contingencies such as staging vehicles or alternative routes
where they will not be blocked by trains.
These projects and others like them are eligible projects under the
CRISI program.
Projects eligible for CRISI or State of Good Repair grant funding
include installation, repair, or improvement of grade separations;
railroad crossing signals, gates, and related technologies; highway
traffic signalization; highway lighting and crossing approach signage;
roadway improvements such as medians or other barriers; railroad
crossing panels and surfaces; and safety engineering improvements to
reduce risk in quiet zones or potential quiet zones.
In our outreach to local communities, FRA notifies officials about
funding opportunities and offers technical assistance for navigating
federal funding processes and application requirements.

Question 4. Does the FRA have any authority to hold railroads more
accountable for identifying solutions in consultation with communities
adversely impacted by unreasonable or unsafe train delays at railroad
crossings?
Answer. Under 49 U.S.C. Chapter 201-213 and its implementing
regulations, FRA does not have specific authority to regulate railroad
activity with regards to blocked crossings. Accordingly, the FRA does
not have the authority to hold railroads accountable for identifying
solutions to blocked crossings. However, we regularly investigate
reports of blocked crossings and work with the railroads and the
communities to collaboratively find solutions. Additionally, FRA
launched an online portal for the public to report blocked crossings.
The report includes the location, time, duration, and consequences of
blocked crossings. FRA uses the data collected from this portal to
identify frequently blocked crossings (greater than 3 times per month).
FRA then contacts the railroad to obtain additional information, such
as the number of cars in the trains and the reason for the stopped
trains, and notifies the railroad of the issue at each crossing. FRA
recently developed detailed geographic information system (GIS) maps of
urban areas with high numbers of blocked crossing reports to provide
additional information to develop local solutions. These GIS maps show
locations of all crossings in a defined area, with at-grade and grade-
separated crossings identified; reported blocked crossings; railroad
infrastructure; streets and highways; and locations of emergency and
first responder operations. These maps will be used by FRA personnel in
discussions to develop measures, both by railroads and communities, to
reduce the frequency, duration, and ultimately the consequences of
blocked crossings.

Questions from Hon. Sam Graves to Jason M. Morris, Assistant Vice
President, Safety and Environmental, Norfolk Southern Corporation

Question 1. Would passing a law limiting the amount of time
railroads could occupy at-grade crossings with a train alleviate or
mitigate the impacts of grade crossings to communities?
Answer. No. In fact, enacting such a law would only exacerbate
those impacts.
We understand the frustration communities sometimes feel about
grade crossings that are occupied for longer periods of time than
expected, and passing a law limiting the amount of time trains can
occupy grade crossings might seem like a simple solution. But
prescribing grade crossing time limits will have unintended
consequences that ultimately will undermine the law's purpose and
objectives.
The issue is that railroads only have so many ways in which they
could comply with such a law, and all of them would create significant
problems.
One way to comply would be to stop the train and ``break'' it by
de-coupling cars and ``clearing'' the crossing of all rail cars before
the prescribed time limit is reached. But breaking the train takes
time, as a rail worker would need to travel to the crossing (either on
foot from the locomotive at the head end of the train or perhaps by
motor vehicle from some other location), de-couple two of the cars,
then direct the train's engineer to pull forward so the cars that
remain attached to the locomotive clear the crossing. If the prescribed
time limit were too short, it would literally be impossible for a
railroad to comply in many cases, because there would not be sufficient
time to complete all of the necessary steps.
However, even if the crossing could be cleared within the
prescribed time limit, breaking the train would offer only temporary
relief. This is because the train crew will need to conduct a brake
test required by federal regulations once the train is reassembled and
before and it can move again. All of these activities (re-assembling
the train, conducting the brake test, and moving the re-assembled train
through the crossing) must take place while rail equipment occupies the
crossing. Just as with the process of disassembling the train, there is
a real question as to whether these activities can be conducted within
the time period prescribed by a hypothetical law. But that issue aside,
the total amount of time the train would occupy the crossing as
required by a grade crossing law (including the time it takes to break
the train, clear the crossing, re-assemble the train, and conduct the
brake test) will in many cases exceed the total amount of time the
train would have occupied the crossing in the absence of a law. Thus,
the total impact to the community--as measured by the total time the
train occupies the crossing--will often be greater as a direct
consequence of the law.
Other ways to comply with a hypothetical law setting a time limit
include altering operations by running shorter trains, by running
trains at higher speeds, or by doing both. Any of these methods of
compliance would have great potential to create negative community
impacts.
Because the rail carrier would need to move the same amount of
freight over the line irrespective of a hypothetical grade crossing
law, a choice to operate shorter trains would necessarily mean
operating more frequent trains. Under this scenario, the total
community impacts along the lines would not improve. After all, the
same number of rail cars will pass through these crossings every day,
which can provide additional opportunities for blocked crossings
because it increases network congestion. And running more frequent
trains would increase the chance that one of those trains will be
involved in a grade crossing or trespasser incident. The only result a
law designed to improve public convenience will have delivered is an
enhanced risk to public safety.
The other choice--operating at higher speeds--is equally
unavailing. In many cases, rail carriers will not be allowed to make
this choice because federal law prescribes maximum operating speeds
depending on the ``class'' of track in question. For a rail carrier
already operating at the maximum track speed, it simply will not be
allowed to operate its trains faster in order to comply with a
hypothetical grade crossing law. For rail carriers operating below the
maximum speed, the hypothetical grade crossing law may leave them with
no practical choice other than to operate faster trains. But the
existing operating practices, including train speeds, are there for a
reason. In some cases, rail carriers operate below maximum track speed
to minimize community impacts from train noise or to reduce the
likelihood or severity of grade crossing accidents. A hypothetical law
regulating the time a train can occupy a grade crossing may force or at
the very least encourage railroads to abandon their voluntary speed
restrictions in order to comply, and all of the public benefits
delivered by existing operating practices would likely vanish.
A grade crossing law could have adverse community impacts in other,
perhaps even less obvious ways. Railroads serve many of their customers
by switching rail cars directly into their plants. These switching
operations often require a series of forward and reverse moves, and
depending on the layout of the customer's facility, the location of the
track serving the customer, and the location of nearby roads and
streets, these operations may in the normal course of business occupy
grade crossings. If a law imposing a limit on the amount of time a
grade crossing can be occupied by a train, service to these customer
facilities may have to be abandoned. In some cases it may be possible
to continue to serve the customer by transloading the freight to trucks
at another location, but this operation would almost certainly be more
expensive and less convenient for the customer, and would create
community impacts as truck traffic is introduced or added at the
customer's plant, the transload facility, and all points between them.

Question 2. How would a law regulating maximum train length impact
rail operations?
Answer. As I mentioned in my first answer, a law regulating train
length directly translates to shorter, more frequent trains. Reducing
train lengths would not help to alleviate the overall inconvenience
some communities experience from occupied grade crossings, but would
instead create a heightened public safety risk.
The impacts would not end there, however. Operating more frequent
trains would mean consuming more rail capacity to move the same amount
of freight. This is because most freight rail operations are governed
by methods that permit only one train to occupy a given segment of
track at a time. More trains mean more occupied segments. Reduced rail
capacity leads to potential diversions of freight to truck and the
attendant increased burdens on roadways and other public
infrastructure, particularly as demand for freight transportation grows
(as it is expected to do for the foreseeable future).
Forcing railroads to operate shorter, more frequent trains also
would negatively impact customer service. More numerous trains create a
more complex network that operates more slowly and is more susceptible
to disruption. In the last year, Norfolk Southern made significant
gains in customer service by reducing operational complexity. Many and
perhaps all of those gains would be reversed by a law forcing it to
operate shorter trains. Unhappy rail customers tend to find other ways
to more their freight, which would only further drive shipments to
trucks.
Finally, operating shorter, more frequent trains would negatively
impact the fuel efficiency of rail operations. More trains means more
locomotives, which means higher fuel consumption to move the same
amount of freight. And higher fuel consumption drives greater
environmental impacts. These environmental impacts would be further
exacerbated by the greater reliance on truck transportation resulting
from the increased burden on rail capacity, the negative impact on
customer service, and the increase in the cost of rail service
(resulting from less efficient operations and higher fuel consumption),
all of which are foreseeable consequences of a law limiting train
length.
