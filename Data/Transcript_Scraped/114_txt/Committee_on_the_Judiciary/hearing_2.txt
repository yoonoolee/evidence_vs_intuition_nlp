(Chairman of the Subcommittee) presiding.
Present: Representatives Gowdy, Goodlatte, Lofgren,

Staff Present: (Majority) Allison Halatei, Parliamentarian

of borders will not alleviate the need for further reforms and
off repeated statistics bears mentioning again, which is that
around 40 percent of those who are not in the country lawfully
originally entered through lawful means. Simply put, around 40
