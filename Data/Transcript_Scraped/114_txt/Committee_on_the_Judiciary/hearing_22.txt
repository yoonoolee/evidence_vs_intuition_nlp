Mr. Goodlatte. Good afternoon. The Judiciary Committee will
come to order, and without objection the Chair is authorized to
declare recesses of the Committee at any time.
We welcome everyone to this afternoon's hearing on H.R. 9,
the ``Innovation Act.'' And I will begin by recognizing myself
for an opening statement. Today we are here to discuss H.R. 9,
the ``Innovation Act.'' The enactment of this bill is something
I consider central to U.S. competitiveness, job creation, and
our Nation's future economic security. This bill builds on our
efforts over the past decade. It can be said that this bill is
the product of years of work. We have worked with Members of
both parties in both the Senate and the House, with
stakeholders from all areas of our economy, and with the
Administration, and the courts.
In February, I along with a large bipartisan group of
Members, reintroduced the Innovation Act. This bill was the
product of multiple discussion drafts and hearings, passing the
House last Congress with more votes than the landmark America
Invents Act of 2011.
Last week we recognized the 225th anniversary of the U.S.
Patent Act. When President Washington signed the bill that laid
the foundation for our patent system, even he could not have
foreseen the revolution in technology that was yet to come.
During these past two centuries, America has been at the
forefront of innovation, from the industrial revolution to the
telegraph and telephone, to advances in medicine, modern
computers and the Internet. To a whole new era of mobile
computing and personal devices. American inventors have led the
world for centuries in new innovations, from Benjamin Franklin
and Thomas Edison to the Wright brothers and Henry Ford. But if
we want to continue as leaders in the global economy, we must
continue to encourage the innovators of today to develop the
technologies of tomorrow.
The fuel that powers the innovation engine that is America
is its people. But the rules of the road require regular
adjustment, and during the last 200 years we have seen our
patent laws updated and modernized. The most significant
reforms took place in 1836, 1952, and most recently in 2011
with the America Invents Act. Of interesting note is that
Section 5 of the original 1790 Patent Act, included an early
version of fee shifting that was updated by Section 285 of the
1952 act, and today the Innovation Act further modernizes and
clarifies that provision of the law.
Many view the AIA as the most comprehensive overhaul to our
patent system since the 1836 Patent Act. However, the AIA was
in many respects a prospective bill. The problems that the
Innovation Act will solve are more immediate and go to the
heart of current abusive patent litigation practices. To that
end, the Innovation Act includes heightened pleading standards,
and transparency provisions requiring parties to do a bit of
due diligence up front before filing an infringement suit is
just plain common sense. It not only reduces litigation
expenses, but saves the courts time and resources. Greater
transparency and information makes our patent system stronger.
The Innovation Act's fee shifting provisions are fair,
predictable, and will be reliably enforced. If a party's
position and conduct is reasonably justified in law and fact,
then there will be no fees shifted, but if you bring an
unreasonable case that is not justified in law and fact, then
you take on the risk that the Court awards reasonable fees
against you. The Innovation Act also provides for more clarity
surrounding initial discovery, case management, joinder
provisions to deal with insolvent shell companies, the common-
law doctrine of customer stays, and protecting IP licenses in
bankruptcy.
We will continue to work to perfect the customer stay
provision and others, and we will work with interested parties
to find reasonable solutions to the issue of demand letter
abuse. Further, the bill's provisions are designed to work hand
in hand with the procedures and practices of the Judicial
Conference, including the Rules Enabling Act and the courts
providing them with clear policy guidance while ensuring that
we are not predetermining outcomes and that the final rules and
the legislation's implementation in the courts will be both
deliberative and effective.
The bill contains needed reforms to address the issues that
businesses of all sizes and industries face from patent troll
type behavior while keeping in mind several key principles,
including targeting abusive behavior rather than specific
entities, preserving valid patent enforcement tools, preserving
patent property rights, promoting invention by independence and
small businesses, and strengthening the overall patent system.
First, we are targeting abusive patent litigation behavior
and not specific entities or attempting to eliminate valid
patent litigation. When we use the term patent troll, it is
more of an adjective describing behavior than a noun. Our goal
is to prevent individuals from taking advantage of gaps in the
system to engage in litigation extortion.
Second, our bill does not diminish or devalue patent
rights. The patent system is integral to U.S. competitiveness,
and we must ensure that any legislative measure does not weaken
the overall patent system or violate our international treaty
obligations, and that it comports with the Constitution.
Third, this bill strikes the right balance, pushing for
robust legal reform measures while protecting property rights
and innovation. Furthermore, supporters of this bill understand
that if America's inventors are forced to waste time with
frivolous litigation, they won't have time for innovation, and
that's what innovation is really all about, isn't it? If you're
able to create something, invent something new and unique, then
you should be allowed to sell your product, grow your business,
hire more workers, and live the American dream. We can no
longer allow our economy and job creators to be held hostage to
legal maneuvers and the judicial lottery. Congress, the Federal
courts, and the USPTO, must take the necessary steps to ensure
that the patent system lives up to its constitutional
underpinnings. This bill holds true to the Constitution, our
founders, and our promise to future generations that America
will continue to lead the world as a fountain for discovery,
innovation, and economic growth.
We will continue to work with any and all stakeholders that
are interested in helping us improve our patent system and this
bill. As we take these steps toward eliminating the abuses of
our patent system, discouraging frivolous patent litigation,
and keeping U.S. patent laws up to date, we will help fuel the
engine of American innovation and creativity, creating new jobs
and growing our economy.

``(a) Award.--The court shall award, to a prevailing party,
reasonable fees and other expenses incurred by that party in connection
with a civil action in which any party asserts a claim for relief
arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents, unless the court
finds that the position and conduct of the nonprevailing party or
parties were reasonably justified in law and fact or that special
circumstances (such as severe economic hardship to a named inventor)
make an award unjust.
``(b) Certification and Recovery.--Upon motion of any party to the
action, the court shall require another party to the action to certify
whether or not the other party will be able to pay an award of fees and
other expenses if such an award is made under subsection (a). If a

under subsection (a), the court may make a party that has been joined
under section 299(d) with respect to such party liable for the
unsatisfied portion of the award.
``(c) Covenant Not To Sue.--A party to a civil action that asserts
a claim for relief arising under any Act of Congress relating to
patents against another party, and that subsequently unilaterally
extends to such other party a covenant not to sue for infringement with
respect to the patent or patents at issue, shall be deemed to be a
nonprevailing party (and the other party the prevailing party) for
purposes of this section, unless the party asserting such claim would
have been entitled, at the time that such covenant was extended, to
voluntarily dismiss the action or claim without a court order under
Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.''.
(2) Conforming amendment and amendment.--
(A) Conforming amendment.--The item relating to

after the first day of the 6-month period ending on that
effective date.
(c) Joinder of Interested Parties.--Section 299 of title 35, United
States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new
subsection:
``(d) Joinder of Interested Parties.--
``(1) Joinder.--In a civil action arising under any Act of
Congress relating to patents in which fees and other expenses
have been awarded under section 285 to a prevailing party
defending against an allegation of infringement of a patent
claim, and in which the nonprevailing party alleging
infringement is unable to pay the award of fees and other
expenses, the court shall grant a motion by the prevailing
party to join an interested party if such prevailing party
shows that the nonprevailing party has no substantial interest
in the subject matter at issue other than asserting such patent
claim in litigation.
``(2) Limitation on joinder.--
``(A) Discretionary denial of motion.--The court
may deny a motion to join an interested party under
paragraph (1) if--
``(i) the interested party is not subject
to service of process; or
``(ii) joinder under paragraph (1) would
deprive the court of subject matter
jurisdiction or make venue improper.
``(B) Required denial of motion.--The court shall
deny a motion to join an interested party under
paragraph (1) if--
``(i) the interested party did not timely
receive the notice required by paragraph (3);
or
``(ii) within 30 days after receiving the
notice required by paragraph (3), the
interested party renounces, in writing and with
notice to the court and the parties to the
action, any ownership, right, or direct
financial interest (as described in paragraph
(4)) that the interested party has in the
patent or patents at issue.
``(3) Notice requirement.--An interested party may not be
joined under paragraph (1) unless it has been provided actual
notice, within 30 days after the date on which it has been
identified in the initial disclosure provided under section
290(b), that it has been so identified and that such party may
therefore be an interested party subject to joinder under this
subsection. Such notice shall be provided by the party who
subsequently moves to join the interested party under paragraph
(1), and shall include language that--
``(A) identifies the action, the parties thereto,
the patent or patents at issue, and the pleading or
other paper that identified the party under section
290(b); and
``(B) informs the party that it may be joined in
the action and made subject to paying an award of fees
and other expenses under section 285(b) if--
``(i) fees and other expenses are awarded
in the action against the party alleging
infringement of the patent or patents at issue
under section 285(a);
``(ii) the party alleging infringement is
unable to pay the award of fees and other
expenses;
``(iii) the party receiving notice under
this paragraph is determined by the court to be
an interested party; and
``(iv) the party receiving notice under
this paragraph has not, within 30 days after
receiving such notice, renounced in writing,
and with notice to the court and the parties to
the action, any ownership, right, or direct
financial interest (as described in paragraph
(4)) that the interested party has in the
patent or patents at issue.
``(4) Interested party defined.--In this subsection, the
term `interested party' means a person, other than the party
alleging infringement, that--
``(A) is an assignee of the patent or patents at
issue;
``(B) has a right, including a contingent right, to
enforce or sublicense the patent or patents at issue;
or
``(C) has a direct financial interest in the patent
or patents at issue, including the right to any part of
an award of damages or any part of licensing revenue,
except that a person with a direct financial interest
does not include--
``(i) an attorney or law firm providing
legal representation in the civil action
described in paragraph (1) if the sole basis
for the financial interest of the attorney or
law firm in the patent or patents at issue
arises from the attorney or law firm's receipt
of compensation reasonably related to the
provision of the legal representation; or
``(ii) a person whose sole financial
interest in the patent or patents at issue is
ownership of an equity interest in the party
alleging infringement, unless such person also
has the right or ability to influence, direct,
or control the civil action.''.
(d) Discovery Limits.--
(1) Amendment.--Chapter 29 of title 35, United States Code,
is amended by adding at the end the following new section:

``Sec. 299A. Discovery in patent infringement action

``(a) Discovery in Patent Infringement Action.--Except as provided
in subsections (b) and (c), in a civil action arising under any Act of
Congress relating to patents, if the court determines that a ruling
relating to the construction of terms used in a patent claim asserted
in the complaint is required, discovery shall be limited, until such
ruling is issued, to information necessary for the court to determine
the meaning of the terms used in the patent claim, including any
interpretation of those terms used to support the claim of
infringement.
``(b) Discretion To Expand Scope of Discovery.--
``(1) Timely resolution of actions.--In the case of an
action under any provision of Federal law (including an action
that includes a claim for relief arising under section 271(e)),
for which resolution within a specified period of time of a
civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to
patents will necessarily affect the rights of a party with
respect to the patent, the court shall permit discovery, in
addition to the discovery authorized under subsection (a),
before the ruling described in subsection (a) is issued as
necessary to ensure timely resolution of the action.
``(2) Resolution of motions.--When necessary to resolve a
motion properly raised by a party before a ruling relating to
the construction of terms described in subsection (a) is
issued, the court may allow limited discovery in addition to
the discovery authorized under subsection (a) as necessary to
resolve the motion.
``(3) Special circumstances.--In special circumstances that
would make denial of discovery a manifest injustice, the court
may permit discovery, in addition to the discovery authorized
under subsection (a), as necessary to prevent the manifest
injustice.
``(4) Actions seeking relief based on competitive harm.--
The limitation on discovery provided under subsection (a) shall
not apply to an action seeking a preliminary injunction to
redress harm arising from the use, sale, or offer for sale of
any allegedly infringing instrumentality that competes with a
product sold or offered for sale, or a process used in
manufacture, by a party alleging infringement.
``(c) Exclusion From Discovery Limitation.--The parties may
voluntarily consent to be excluded, in whole or in part, from the
limitation on discovery provided under subsection (a) if at least one
plaintiff and one defendant enter into a signed stipulation, to be
filed with and signed by the court. With regard to any discovery
excluded from the requirements of subsection (a) under the signed
stipulation, with respect to such parties, such discovery shall proceed
according to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.''.
(2) Conforming amendment.--The table of sections for
chapter 29 of title 35, United States Code, is amended by
adding at the end the following new item:

``299A. Discovery in patent infringement action.''.

(e) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that it is an
abuse of the patent system and against public policy for a party to
send out purposely evasive demand letters to end users alleging patent
infringement. Demand letters sent should, at the least, include basic
information about the patent in question, what is being infringed, and
how it is being infringed. Any actions or litigation that stem from
these types of purposely evasive demand letters to end users should be
considered a fraudulent or deceptive practice and an exceptional
circumstance when considering whether the litigation is abusive.
(f) Demand Letters.--Section 284 of title 35, United States Code,
is amended--
(1) in the first undesignated paragraph, by striking ``Upon
finding'' and inserting ``(a) In General.--Upon finding'';
(2) in the second undesignated paragraph, by striking
``When the damages'' and inserting ``(b) Assessment by Court;
Treble Damages.--When the damages'';
(3) by inserting after subsection (b), as designated by
paragraph (2) of this subsection, the following:
``(c) Willful Infringement.--A claimant seeking to establish
willful infringement may not rely on evidence of pre-suit notification
of infringement unless that notification identifies with particularity
the asserted patent, identifies the product or process accused,
identifies the ultimate parent entity of the claimant, and explains
with particularity, to the extent possible following a reasonable
investigation or inquiry, how the product or process infringes one or
more claims of the patent.''; and
(4) in the last undesignated paragraph, by striking ``The
court'' and inserting ``(d) Expert Testimony.--The court''.
(g) Effective Date.--Except as otherwise provided in this section,
the amendments made by this section shall take effect on the date of
the enactment of this Act and shall apply to any action for which a
complaint is filed on or after that date.

SEC. 4. TRANSPARENCY OF PATENT OWNERSHIP.

(a) Amendments.--Section 290 of title 35, United States Code, is
amended--
(1) in the heading, by striking ``suits'' and inserting
``suits; disclosure of interests'';
(2) by striking ``The clerks'' and inserting ``(a) Notice
of Patent Suits.--The clerks''; and
(3) by adding at the end the following new subsections:

in paragraph (2) to address the asymmetries in discovery
burdens and costs in any civil action arising under any Act of
Congress relating to patents. Such rules and procedures shall
include how and when payment for document discovery in addition
to the discovery of core documentary evidence is to occur, and
what information must be presented to demonstrate financial
capacity before permitting document discovery in addition to
the discovery of core documentary evidence.

procedures required under paragraph (1) should address each of
the following issues and proposals:
(A) Discovery of core documentary evidence.--
Whether and to what extent each party to the action is
entitled to receive core documentary evidence and shall

documentary evidence within the possession or control
of each such party, and whether and to what extent each
party to the action may seek nondocumentary discovery
as otherwise provided in the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure.
(B) Electronic communication.--If the parties
determine that the discovery of electronic
communication is appropriate, whether such discovery
shall occur after the parties have exchanged initial
disclosures and core documentary evidence and whether

electronic communication shall be specific and
may not be a general request for the production
of information relating to a product or

custodian of the information requested, the
search terms, and a time frame. The parties
shall cooperate to identify the proper
custodians, the proper search terms, and the
proper time frame.

requests to more than 5 custodians, unless the
parties jointly agree to modify the number of
production requests without leave of the court.

requests for up to 5 additional custodians per
producing party, upon a showing of a distinct
need based on the size, complexity, and issues
of the case.

electronic communication for additional
custodians beyond the limits agreed to by the
parties or granted by the court, the requesting
party shall bear all reasonable costs caused by
such additional discovery.
(C) Additional document discovery.--Whether the
following should apply:
(i) In general.--Each party to the action
may seek any additional document discovery
otherwise permitted under the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure, if such party bears the
reasonable costs, including reasonable
attorney's fees, of the additional document
discovery.
(ii) Requirements for additional document
discovery.--Unless the parties mutually agree
otherwise, no party may be permitted additional
document discovery unless such a party posts a
bond, or provides other security, in an amount
sufficient to cover the expected costs of such
additional document discovery, or makes a
showing to the court that such party has the
financial capacity to pay the costs of such
additional document discovery.
(iii) Limits on additional document
discovery.--A court, upon motion, may determine
that a request for additional document
discovery is excessive, irrelevant, or
otherwise abusive and may set limits on such
additional document discovery.

upon motion and for good cause shown, may
modify the requirements of subparagraphs (A)
and (B) and any definition under paragraph (3).

of Civil Procedure, the parties shall jointly
submit any proposed modifications of the
requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) and
any definition under paragraph (3), unless the
parties do not agree, in which case each party
shall submit any proposed modification of such
party and a summary of the disagreement over
the modification.
(v) Computer code.--A court, upon motion
and for good cause shown, may determine that
computer code should be included in the
discovery of core documentary evidence. The
discovery of computer code shall occur after
the parties have exchanged initial disclosures
and other core documentary evidence.

parties shall discuss and address in the written report
filed pursuant to Rule 26(f) of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure the views and proposals of each party
on the following:

evidence should be completed.
(ii) Whether additional document discovery
will be sought under subparagraph (C).

_______________________________________________________________________

Mr. Goodlatte. I look forward to hearing from all of our
witnesses on the Innovation Act and the issue of abusive patent
litigation. And now it's my pleasure to recognize the Ranking
Member of the Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property and
the Internet, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Nadler, for his
opening statement.
Mr. Nadler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing which
will help us to examine the Innovation Act and the problem of
abusive patent litigation. I am proud to join you as a
cosponsor of this legislation so that we can deter patent
trolls and protect individuals and businesses from abusive
patent litigation. But as I have said before, and as many have
said before, no legislation is perfect, and this hearing will
help us to determine how H.R. 9 can be further improved.
Our economy depends on innovation to grow and to thrive,
and this has been true since the dawn of our Nation. The
founders knew the importance of patent protection in fostering
innovation and even wrote it into the Constitution. Last week
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office celebrated a 225th
anniversary of the first U.S. patent act just days after
issuing its 9 millionth patent. Strong patent protection has
helped unleash unmatched creativity in this country, and it's
vital that we maintain a strong and vibrant patent system.
Unfortunately the system currently faces a wave of abusive
litigation by patent trolls, which stifles innovation and
threatens our economy. Patent trolls use litigation or the
threat of litigation as a weapon to extort settlements from
innocent defendants. They generally own weak patents and make
vague claims that will require extensive and time-consuming
discovery on the part of the defendant. Many patent trolls prey
on end users who have no knowledge or control over the alleged
infringing project. Their goal is to drive up the cost of
litigation and force the defendant to determine that it simply
makes financial sense to settle even a totally bogus claim
early, rather than seeing litigation through to the end and
paying the exorbitant legal fees that can go along with such a
course of action. Such abusive litigation threatens small and
large businesses alike. Those companies that refuse to give in
to the patent trolls' demands may be forced to spend millions
of dollars defending a frivolous lawsuit. And it is not just
businesses that should be concerned about these lawsuits.
Patent trolls harm all consumers searching for the next great
invention to improve their lives. That is because every dollar
spent fending off frivolous lawsuits is a dollar that cannot be
spent on research and development or on improving customer
service. When patent trolls win, the rest of us lose.
I support the Innovation Act because a strong patent system
requires that we protect businesses and consumers from the harm
caused by abusive litigation. But I am mindful of the fact that
in addressing the patent troll problem, we must not impose too
great a burden on legitimate plaintiffs. A strong patent system
also depends on inventors having the ability to protect their
creations in court. We must be careful to ensure that the
reforms included in this legislation do not have unintended
consequences. For example, it is no secret that I have
traditionally been an opponent of loser pays provisions. People
or businesses with legally legitimate disputes should not be
punished for trying to protect their interests in court.
H.R. 9 attempts to strike a balance, that will deter patent
trolls from filing frivolous suits while protecting those with
reasonable but ultimately unsuccessful claims. I have made it
clear, however, that my support for this legislation depends in
part on a commitment that the fee shifting provision will not
get any more stringent than in the current version of the
legislation. I hope it can be improved further. In fact, I will
be interested to hear from our witnesses their thoughts on
whether this bill strikes an appropriate balance in this
regard.
I particularly want to welcome Michelle Lee and
congratulate her on her recent confirmation as Director of the
Patent and Trademark Office. I look forward to her testimony
and to the testimony of all our witnesses as we explore the
Innovation Act in depth. There are many provisions in this bill
that require close consideration, and I appreciate the
opportunity to examine them today.
I thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. Goodlatte. I thank the gentleman.
The Chair is now pleased to recognize the gentleman from
California, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Courts
Intellectual Property, and the Internet, Mr. Issa, for his
opening statement.
Mr. Issa. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think it's altogether
fitting that this be a full Committee hearing because, Ms. Lee,
clearly you are at the heart of why we are, in fact, producing
H.R. 9. Often Members of this body will talk about patent
trolls. They'll talk about weak patents being used by these
trolls. They'll talk about our friends in Marshall and Tyler,
Texas who seemed to never find a patent they didn't want to
consider valid and enforceable and infringed. However, since we
passed the landmark legislation in 2011, it has become clear
that to this day we still have a problem at the USPTO. This is
not a problem of the making of the Patent and Trademark Office.
As a matter of fact, as the Chairman just said, celebrating the
9 millionth patent is quite a celebration.
However, my little sister, born in 1961 could have
celebrated the 3 millionth patent. We have in my lifetime
produced more than three out of every four patents produced
since our founding. This epidemic of innovation would be a good
thing if, in fact, patents were rigorously defended throughout
the process, the Patent Office had ever better information, and
to be honest, if the bias had been toward obviousness not
becoming the hallmark of innovation.
During my lifetime it has become extremely common for
inventors to simply take the inevitable direction of a new
technology and re-patent what was previously patented under the
previous technology. This occurs in the automotive industry, in
all the sciences, including even in health care.
So as we meet with our Under Secretary, it is very clear
that our greatest goal in our reform is not just in Article III
courts, where heightened pleading and fee shifting clearly will
make a difference for trolls, but, in fact, every inventor
should have to work harder, narrow further, their claims so
that the real patent they receive from the Patent Office, they
have patent certainty on.
Often many of the companies in BIO come before this
Committee and into my office, and they talk about certainty.
And I tell them, if your patent is often reduced or even made
invalid when scrutinized either by the Patent and Trademark
Office or in an Article III court or even in the ITC, then in
fact we have done you a disservice, but you have done yourself
a disservice. An inventor is best off having a narrow patent,
fully understood, so that he or she can assert that patent when
appropriate and understand that innovation comes, quite
candidly, from patents that you work around.
So as we go into H.R. 9, as was said earlier, a bill that
in the last Congress enjoyed a 33 to 5 in this Committee's
support and 325 positive votes on the House floor, I want
everyone to understand that like the Chairman of the full
Committee and the other Members, I'll work tirelessly to try to
find ways to make this bill better in the basic ways of both
streamlining the activities that go on once a patent is granted
but also work with the Patent and Trademark Office to ensure
that in the future we will have patents which are either not
granted, or granted more clearly so that once granted, an
inventor understands what the limitations of their patent is.
I think today, Mr. Chairman, we will undoubtedly hear from
Ms. Lee in detail about the success of the CBM program and re-
examinations and where we can work with the Patent and
Trademark Office to ensure that post-grant and other ways to
improve patent quality are addressed in this bill. And I want
to thank the Chairman again for giving us an opportunity for
both of these important panels, and I yield back.
Mr. Goodlatte. The Chair thanks the gentleman.
Without objection all other Members' opening statements
will be made a part of the record.
We welcome our distinguished witness for today's first
panel, and Ms. Lee, if you would rise, I will begin by swearing
you in.
Do you swear that the testimony that you are about to give
shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth
so help you God?
Thank you very much. Let the record reflect that the
witness responded in the affirmative.
Our first witness today is the Honorable Michelle Lee,
Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and
Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In
her role as Director, she oversees one of the largest
intellectual property offices in the world and serves as the
principal adviser to the President on both domestic and
international intellectual property matters. Prior to her role
as director, Ms. Lee was Deputy Director and also served as the
first director of the Silicon Valley USPTO.
Her experience also includes being the first head of
patents and strategy at Google while serving as the company's
deputy general counsel. She received her J.D. from Stanford Law
School and her M.S. and B.S. in electrical engineering and
computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
Ms. Lee, welcome. Your testimony will be entered into the
record in its entirety, and we ask that you summarize your
statement in 5 minutes or less. And to help you with that,
there's a timing light on the table. We again welcome you.

TESTIMONY OF THE HONORABLE MICHELLE LEE, UNDER SECRETARY OF
COMMERCE FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND DIRECTOR OF THE UNITED
STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE

Ms. Lee. Thank you. Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member
Conyers, Chairman Issa, and Ranking Member Nadler, thank you
for the opportunity to discuss with you our views on H.R. 9,
the ``Innovation Act.'' Mr. Chairman, we are pleased that you
have reintroduced the Innovation Act to begin the legislative
patent reform efforts in the 114th Congress, to curtail abusive
patent litigation, to increase patent transparency, and to
level the playing field for all innovators.
As a general matter, we believe that the final bill should
target truly abusive practices while maintaining a patent
owner's legitimate right to enforce his or her patent. Further,
we believe that the final legislation should take a fair and
balanced approach that neither favors nor disfavors any
particular area of technology, industry, or business model.
Finally, any current legislative effort should, of course, take
into account recent changes in the patent system that have come
from the courts through rulings and local rules, by the
Judicial Conference via its rule changes and from the USPTO
through its implementation and refinement of the America
Invents Act post-grant trials, as well as its enhanced patent
quality initiative.
With these principles in mind, allow me to focus my limited
time on a few key provisions in the Innovation Act. My written
statement contains more detailed thoughts, factors to be
weighed, and views regarding provisions in the bill.
First, we generally support the bill's proposal to require
an award of attorney's fees and expenses in patent cases where
it is proven that the losing party's position or conduct was
unreasonable. Fault-based fee shifting will raise the cost for
those engaging in abusive tactics, whether plaintiffs or
defendants. It gives the financial incentive to prepare and to
present their cases responsibly, and it should discourage
parties from bringing unjustified cases. This type of
attorneys' fee provision will also help ensure consistency in
fee awards across the judicial districts.
Second, we believe it is good policy to have patent owners
provide more information to defendants in a complaint about why
they allegedly infringe a patent than is mandated by current
law. Accordingly, we generally support the Innovation Act's
requirement that a complaint explain how each element of a
patent claim is met by an accused product or process or why
such information is not readily accessible.
We believe that requiring the identification of the
allegedly infringing products and an explanation of how they
infringe at least one claim of each asserted patent is
important. But any requirement to plead additional claims in a
patent at this early stage of litigation should be weighed in
light of the burdens it would place on the patent owner, the
potential that it creates for procedural motions that may not
materially advance the case, and incentives that it creates to
overplead marginally relevant patent claims.
Legislation should account for the fact that a party often
lacks a complete understanding of the case at the outset. We
recognize that there are ongoing negotiations on how to craft
the details of this proposal to address these various concerns,
and we are supportive of those efforts.
I would also like to address the Innovation Act's proposal
to stay discovery until a court issues a claim construction
ruling. Now let me begin by saying that I am well aware of the
high cost of discovery in patent litigation cases. Discovery is
a significant cost driver in litigation, and we are committed
to working with the Committee and stakeholders to find
proposals that will reduce these costs. But claim construction
is complex, and it can be difficult to perform in a vacuum.
Often it takes some amount of additional discovery to
understand which claims and which technical terms in those
claims are critical and must be construed, and claim
construction alone may not dispose of a case, especially when
there has been no discovery on infringement and invalidity. In
those cases, discovery costs wouldn't be avoided, only delayed.
We believe that there may be alternatives to reducing excessive
discovery in patent litigation worth considering, and we
welcome the opportunity to work with the Committee and
stakeholders to develop such proposals.
Finally, we generally support the bill's proposals to
protect customers using off-the-shelf products such as a coffee
shop that uses an Internet router. A customer stay provision
would allow the party who understands the technology, the
manufacturer, to handle the case. Of course, appropriate
safeguards should be included. For example, the manufacturer
and customer both agreeing to the stay, and in exchange for the
stay, the customer agreeing to be bound by the ruling. With
safeguards such as these, we believe strides can be made to
help curtail some of the most coercive patent litigation abuses
while simultaneously appropriately preserving limited judicial
resources.
We understand that there are extensive, or were extensive
negotiations on this topic last year, and we are also
supportive of these efforts. I will defer to my written
statement for more details on the rest of the many important
provisions in this bill, but briefly I will say that the USPTO
generally supports the bill's provisions on; transparency,
patent licenses in foreign bankruptcy proceedings, demand
letters, and the many technical corrections.
Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to share our
views on these important issues. My staff and I are available
to help in any way we can toward crafting meaningful, fair, and
balanced legislative reforms that are so important to
strengthening our patent system for American innovators. Thank
you.
Mr. Goodlatte. Thank you, Director Lee.
[The prepared statement of Ms. Lee follows:]

__________
Mr. Goodlatte. And I'll begin the questioning. I appreciate
your testimony, and seeing that the Administration continues to
be committed to seeing patent reform enacted into law and that
they view this as a high legislative priority, in that vein I'd
like to ask for unanimous consent to submit the White House's
Statement of Administration Policy on H.R. 3309, the
``Innovation Act'' from last Congress, which expresses strong
support for our bill.
[The information referred to follows:]
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

__________
Mr. Goodlatte. Director, I'd also like to ask you to talk
more about three things. First, the importance of the
Innovation Act's fee-shifting provisions; second, the ways to
make the joinder provisions clearer that they apply to
insolvent shell companies that file frivolous suits and not
legitimate startups and universities; and, third, on customer
stay. As we look to improve that provision, do you support the
customer stay language negotiated last May in the Senate?
Ms. Lee. Thank you very much for your question, Mr.
Chairman. Let me start with the first of the issues that you
raised, fee shifting. As I mentioned, we are generally
supportive of the provision introduced in H.R. 9 on fee
shifting. We believe it raises the cost for those who are
engaging in abusive tactics, and it provides the right
financial incentives for both plaintiffs and defendants.
With regard to ways to improve the joinder provision to
make sure that we are targeting the right individuals but yet
excluding others, I think as a general matter it is critical
that we ensure that passive investors, those who do not have
the ability to control or direct the litigation, are not
subject to any kind of joinder or fee liability. We need to
protect that because otherwise we can chill investment in some
very important new enterprises which is so critical to our
Nation's continued economic success.
And as to universities, my thought there is the
university's business model happens to be education, but we
shouldn't distinguish between what people's business model is.
If they're engaged in abusive behavior, as much as I appreciate
universities and their ability to contribute to innovation,
it's important that if they're engaged in abusive behavior and
they direct and control abusive litigation, that they too
should be responsible. So, whatever your business model, if you
control or engage in abusive litigation, you should be able to
bejoined or held liable. And the final issue was----
Mr. Goodlatte. Customer stay language.
Ms. Lee. Customer stay, we're generally supportive of the
concepts in it.
Mr. Goodlatte. And last May the Senate negotiated some
language. If you're familiar with that, do you have an opinion
on that?
Ms. Lee. I think we are generally supportive with the
concepts there.
Mr. Goodlatte. Thank you. We have all heard about
plaintiff-friendly venues and patent cases being brought in
jurisdictions where neither party is conducting any business
whatsoever. What are your thoughts on addressing the issue of
venue.
Ms. Lee. So venue is a very important issue, and many
courts are working hard to actively manage their cases and
control discovery in their district courts. A few courts permit
broader discovery, and it appears to be limited to a small
number of courts and Federal districts. So one option might be
to focus on reducing the opportunities for forum shopping and
the advantages of forum shopping by increasing or tightening
the venue requirements. Making sure that the parties who end up
in a district, have real ties, meaningful business ties, to
that district, I think would benefit patent litigation
throughout the entire process, not just early on in terms of
discovery pre-claim construction, but at time of ruling for
summary judgment, at trial, and so forth. So there are clear
advantages to be had in considering proposals related to
tightening venue restrictions.
Mr. Goodlatte. Thank you. One last question. Just last week
we saw that the Electronic Frontier Foundation succeeded in an
inter partes review of Personal Audio's notorious podcasting
patent. If someone is bringing a legitimate post-grant or IPR
to the USPTO showing that there are problems with the patent,
then that clearly goes to patent quality. But if someone is
bringing a frivolous case or demanding cash settlements not to
file, then that would appear to be a clear abuse of the system.
I believe that the USPTO has full authority under the America
Invents Act to address the latter. Understanding that any
legislative fixes could potentially impede the USPTO's ability
to address such issues, what is the USPTO doing to prevent the
IPR process from being abused.
Ms. Lee. Thank you very much for the question, Mr.
Chairman. You are right. The USPTO is working hard to make sure
that the proceedings, the AIA post-grant review proceedings are
as efficient and fair as possible.
And one of the first initiatives that I undertook when I
became the head of the office, first as Deputy Director, was to
reach out to the public who had been using the post-grant
review proceedings and get input on what we were doing right,
what was working, and what was not working, and what we could
improve upon. And we engaged in an eight-city listening tour
which I have to say each of the cities the attendance was very
well attended, and we also solicited written comments on how to
improve those proceedings. We have gotten that input. We have
already issued some quick fixes, and by summertime you will see
some proposed rules on how we can again strengthen the post-
grant review proceedings, trials, and make them fairer and more
efficient, and we hope to complete that process by the end of
the year.
So Congress has given us the authority to implement those
proceedings. We have implemented it. We also have the authority
to refine it, and where we can within the congressional mandate
we are doing everything that we can to make sure those
proceedings are fair and efficient.
Mr. Goodlatte. Thank you. The Chair recognizes the
gentleman from New York, Mr. Nadler, for his questions.
Mr. Nadler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Lee, in your
testimony you say that a plaintiff should only be required to
notify the defendant of a single representative claim. If the
plaintiff conducts, as we would expect, the necessary
investigation to determine how his or her patent was infringed,
why would they not be able to bring all the claims alleged at
the outset?
Ms. Lee. Thank you, very much, Congressman Nadler, for the
question. As a general matter, certainly earlier and greater
notice with respect to claims pled, helps expedite the
resolution of the case and streamline discovery. And we
support, of course, the removal of Form 18 which provided a
very low threshold for pleadings in patent cases and a
complaint requiring as a baseline for at least one claim, a
description of how each element is met by an accused product or
process or the reasons why that information is not readily
accessible.
The issues of pleading and how much should be included in
the complaint are complex and have many competing
considerations that should be weighed. And a concern we have is
that requiring the pleading of additional claims with greater
specificity at the beginning of a litigation might unduly
burden a patent owner, might encourage needless and early
procedural motions in the form of motions to dismiss and not
materially advance the case when all that is required is an
appropriately pled, single claim in order for the case to move
forward. Patent owners oftentimes lack full information about
the case at the beginning when they're filing the complaint,
but we recognize the need to have to balance on the one hand
notice to defendants against the burden and fairness of the
plaintiffs, and we recognize that there are negotiations going
on to address these very important concerns and issues, and we
look forward to supporting those and providing help where we
can.
Mr. Nadler. But pursuing the same vein, complaints, of
course, can be amended as the discovery progresses; but if a
plaintiff knows what other claims they believe are infringed
when they initially file their complaint, why should they not
be required to put all their complaints--of their claims in
that complaint? Couldn't it be considered being deceptive if
they only put some of them in?
Ms. Lee. So if there is a heightened pleading requirement
in the complaint, clearly there is an incentive to get every
claim in that you think is allegedly infringed, including
perhaps some of them that you have not fully developed. So,
there maybe an incentive to over plead, and we have seen cases
where you have patent litigation where there are multiple
patents, and within each patent there are multiple claims
asserted. Sometimes you can have upwards of tens if not close
to a hundred claims. And that's a very voluminous complaint you
have there if you're going element by element. All of that
said, certainly greater specificity is beneficial, and you've
got to weigh that against the burdens on the plaintiff pre-
discovery for providing that sort of information.
Mr. Nadler. Okay. Now patent trolls, as we know, seek to
leverage the cost of discovery to extort settlements from
defendants. That's the whole point of--one of the major points
of patent trolls. Everything we can do to focus discovery on
genuine issues and eliminate the extraneous demands would both
limit the trolls' leverage and enhance the efficient progress
of the litigation. Do you agree that a district court is
competent to manage such a process that would limit the
parties' exchange to the core documents actually essential to
the claimed infringement, and do you agree that parties could
be required to pay for materials outside that core? And if not,
why not?
Ms. Lee. So, the question is, do we think a district court
is competent to manage the production of core documents
requiring the parties to pay for the production of core
documents and the parties the other costs. I think there's a
lot of sense to that proposal, and I think certainly many
district courts across the country are very capable of doing
that. And then the question is do we want a uniform standard
across all district courts in the country, and do we want to
legislate that to make sure that that happens?
Mr. Nadler. And do you think----
Ms. Lee. I think there's an advantage to uniformity in our
system.
Mr. Nadler. And therefore we should legislate that?
Ms. Lee. It should be something that we consider amongst
many others, but yes.
Mr. Nadler. Thank you. I yield back.
Mr. Issa [presiding]. Thank you. I recognize myself now.
I'm going to follow up with the Ranking Member went through
that. Is this something that we should allow the Fed circuit
input into, so that in fact, we work in harmony with those
rules? Essentially I think his point is a good one which is if
you know that your elements on appeal are one court and you
know that there is one USPTO, shouldn't we find a way, whether
working with the courts or on our own and with you, to mandate
a sufficient similarity of the courts that, in fact, forum
shopping is less valuable?
Ms. Lee. I'm in favor of anything we can do to decrease the
opportunities and advantages of forum shopping. I think that it
imposes a discipline across all district courts to provide
consistency.
Mr. Issa. And to that extent, I'd like to shift to the CBM
program. Obviously that's a program designed to dramatically
reduce the caseload on Article III courts. Could you give us an
update on what it's done to reduce low-quality patents?
Ms. Lee. Yes. Thank you very much, Chairman Issa, for that
question. The USPTO has successfully implemented the CBM
program pursuant to the America Invents Act, meeting its
congressional intent. And it was meant to provide a faster,
more efficient low-cost alternative to district court
litigation with regard to a certain category of patents, those
pertaining to financial services. And we have implemented
those, and I want to share some statistics with you about them.
We have received 321 filings to date with 206 institutions
and 43 written decisions, and for the most part based upon the
input that we've received from the roundtable discussions, the
eight-city listening tour, I think stakeholders have found the
proceedings to be helpful; and we have also heard from the
stakeholders areas we can improve on it, and we are certainly
working on that.
Mr. Issa. And staying on the subject of patent improvement,
the IPR process, you know, when I was producing products and
applying for patents, it was an interesting world because there
was a one-way exchange where I gave all the information to the
patent examiner, and he or she may or may not have had the
other side of the story in catalogues. And then if somebody
presented a patent and I wanted to narrow that patent that
somebody else had, I went through a reexamination process where
I essentially threw material at the Patent Office and hoped
that they would take it up and reconstruct the claims, but I
had no input. So, can you give us the important difference in
the IPR process?
Ms. Lee. So I think, Chairman Issa, you hit exactly the
point which is that in the IPR proceedings, you have two sides
to a proceeding or----
Mr. Issa. Three if we include you.
Ms. Lee. I'm usually not a party to it, although I could
be. But you have two sides, so by virtue of advocacy, each side
is putting forth their best arguments as to either why the
patent is valid or why it is invalid, and there is a benefit to
that. So, the IPR proceedings, as Members of Congress intended,
was meant to be a quality check on the patents that were
already in the system. The USPTO is working on the quality of
the patent it issues during an examination before it issues,
but the IPR, the post-grant review proceedings, and the covered
business method, those three categories of proceedings were
meant to be a check on the quality of the patents in the patent
system after issuance.
Mr. Issa. Straightforward question; do you think the CBM
program should be extended, or continued would be another way
of putting it?
Ms. Lee. So it is scheduled to expire, and the question is
should it be extended? And I believe the intent of the CBM
proceedings was to address some patents that had issued out of
the United States Patent and Trademark Office in the area of
business methods related to financial services. And that this
program would be in effect for a period of time and that
patents that should not have issued would be removed. And
that's why it was meant to be a temporary program. As to
whether it should be extended or not, I think that's up for----
Mr. Issa. Let me ask you a leading question if I may.
Ms. Lee. Okay.
Mr. Issa. Isn't it true that in reviewing those financial
patents, what you often discover is that there was a trade
practice that was widely known but was not presented when the
patent application was applied for; and, in fact, today aren't
there many business practices that are widely used but not at
your researchers' disposal?
Ms. Lee. So the question is?
Mr. Issa. Do you still not know what you find out later on
in the CBM process at the time that you're granting new
patents?
Ms. Lee. I think we know many more things now than we did
when some of the patents that are at subject or issue in the
CBM proceedings were issued, because the USPTO's resources and
databases are much richer and deeper. So, I think the USPTO has
done a much better job at issuing the patents that should
issue.
Mr. Issa. Well I have so many more questions and no more
time. With that is the Ranking Member ready? It's my pleasure
to recognize the gentleman from Michigan, the Ranking Member,
Mr. Conyers, for 5 minutes.
Mr. Conyers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Excuse my tardiness.
And of course Ms. Lee, I really wanted to be with you at your
testimony. I thank you as the Director and Under Secretary. In
your opening statement I believe it's been indicated whether
the USPTO supports Section 3(d) of H.R. 9. And I wanted to give
you an opportunity to enlighten us on that. The provision stays
discovery in patent cases pending a ruling by the Court on
claim construction. That provision might lead to duplication in
discovery. Does USPTO or you support this as written, or are
there other preferred alternatives?
Ms. Lee. Well, thank you very much for the question. And I
think I mentioned an alternative which is considering
tightening the venue requirements. Another alternative might be
to consider staying discovery pending a ruling by the district
court on motions to transfer. Those are two alternatives that
might be a possibility. But we recognize that discovery is a
big, important driver in many patent litigations in terms of
incentives and cost and so forth. And we certainly support H.R.
9's provision to have the Judicial Conference look at
imbalances between plaintiffs and defendants in discovery, and
we believe that H.R. 9's stay provision on discovery pending
claim construction, needs to be weighed carefully, both the
benefits of delaying discovery in an attempt to save some costs
up front against the cost of preventing the parties and the
Court from developing a more complete understanding of the case
through earlier and fuller discovery.
And based upon my experience and also serving on the
Northern District of California Local Patent Rules Committee,
which is a committee that promulgates case management and
discovery rules on patent cases, claim construction of
technical terms is complicated. And one concern might be that
it's hard to construe claims in a vacuum, in the abstract. And
even a minimal amount of information early in a case including
on validity or infringement, can facilitate an early resolution
or settlement of a case. So further claim construction is
oftentimes not always dispositive. So in that instance,
discovery wouldn't be avoided. It would just be delayed.
And there are differences, too, in patent infringement
cases. In some cases claim construction and infringement is
critically important, and the stay mentioned might actually
just work out just fine. In other cases, you've got other
issues that might be case dispositive such as inequitable
conduct or laches. So, I think there are differences in patent
cases, but we should definitely be considering all proposals to
ensure that discovery facilitates early resolution, avoids
excesses, and is fair to both plaintiffs and defendants.
Mr. Conyers. Well, I'm glad to hear that you have some
recommendations to make this a better bill. I had even more
than you. I'm interested in working on it. I think H.R. 9 could
be seriously improved, and this would be a start. Let me just
ask about the written testimony in which you assert that the
USPTO generally supports the concepts of Section 5 of H.R. 9,
which provides for stays of customer suits in patent cases. Do
you have offhand any recommendations for how we might improve
that language?
Ms. Lee. It's generally a good provision in concept. We're
supportive of encouraging a stay of a case against retailers
and customers while the case is being litigated by the
manufacturer. We believe that the end user and the retailer,
they oftentimes lack the technical understanding of how the
product works. The manufacturer has that information, and the
manufacturer also has the incentive to fight vigorously and
defend vigorously, so they have the information, and they have
the incentives and therefore they're probably the appropriate
party.
And so some thoughts into what might be necessary or
included in such a provision are that you want to make sure
that the manufacturer and the end user retailer are in
agreement that that stay should be in effect. And secondly, you
want to give the end user and retailer the option to opt out.
Mr. Conyers. Let me get----
Mr. Issa. I'd ask unanimous consent the gentleman have an
additional minute. Without objection.
Mr. Conyers. Thank you, sir. Let me just ask you in
conclusion about the expansiveness of the joinder provision in
3(c) in the bill, especially if it might be used to chill
investments. Does that leave you as concerned as I am about
that portion of the bill?
Ms. Lee. I think that's an issue that is of great
importance. I mean, you don't want to chill investments in new
enterprises because those who are passive investors in a
company are subject to a possible fee-shifting award or
possibly being joined in a lawsuit.
Mr. Conyers. Thank you very much. Thank the Chairman.
Mr. Issa. And I thank the Ranking Member. We now go to the
gentleman from Virginia for 5 minutes. Mr. Forbes.
Mr. Forbes. Chairman, thank you. Ms. Lee, thank you for
being here today. You stated in your testimony that the USPTO
believes that identification of the allegedly infringing
products, an explanation of how they infringe in at least one
claim of each asserted patent, would provide needed notice to
accused infringers. This is a lot less information than is
currently required by H.R. 9, but it was my understanding that
you had stated previously that H.R. 9 struck the right balance
between placing burdens on the patent owner and the need to
provide adequate information for defendants. Why the shift in
policy and in your opinion?
Ms. Lee. So, we definitely favor heightened notice to
patent defendants in patent pleadings, and a proposal to
heighten the pleading requirements for at least one claim, and
certainly the removal of Form 18, would go a long ways and
certainly accomplish that. Now, what beyond one claim, we need
to require heightened pleading and specificity for a patent
infringement claim. I think we need to take into account all
the factors that I discussed. Right. We have to weigh and take
into account the burden on the plaintiff, their access to
information, and really trying to avoid over pleading of
marginally relevant claims to make sure that our litigation
process is streamlined.
Mr. Forbes. But did you previously state that you felt that
H.R. 9 struck the right balance between placing burdens on the
patent owner and the need to provide adequate information for
defendants.
Ms. Lee. What we said is we generally agree with the
heightened pleading requirements in H.R. 9, including an
element-by-element explanation of how the product infringes a
claim. But on the issue of the claims and which claims are
required to be pled with specificity, at least one, and beyond
one we should definitely weigh factors.
Mr. Forbes. So it's your position today that you haven't
changed your policy. That's always been your policy?
Ms. Lee. Correct.
Mr. Forbes. So you don't think that more information for
defendants to adequately address the claims asserted would help
improve the patent litigation system?
Ms. Lee. More information would help, and certainly
requiring heightened pleadings for at least one claim is an
improvement. And the question is is that enough, and you need
to take into account the other factors of determining. It's a
balance. I mean, there are many competing factors, and we want
to be fair to both the plaintiffs and defendants.
Mr. Forbes. Now, as someone with extensive background in
the technology industry, do you think that the technology
industry is unique compared with other industries such that
tech companies are more vulnerable to patent trolls than other
IT-intensive industries due to its unique ecosystem? Do you
think the current patent system hurts innovation and the
ability of U.S. technology companies to compete globally?
Ms. Lee. I think we have got one of the best intellectual
property systems in the world. And now that I have had the
privilege of having the job that I have and serving in it for 1
year and having the opportunity to meet with individuals in
foreign countries who lead other intellectual property offices,
they all want to know what we're doing in the United States to
incentivize the innovation that we incentivize. All of that
said, I think I feel an obligation, and I think all of us want
to make sure that we continue ensuring that the patent system
in the United States is as strong as it can possibly be, and I
think that's why we're all here today.
Mr. Forbes. So you don't think that tech companies are more
vulnerable to patent trolls than any other industry?
Ms. Lee. I think patent litigation abuse can occur in a
variety of industries. It's not limited to any one. So as we
craft proposals, we want to craft proposals that are not
industry-specific and that are just good policy.
Mr. Forbes. Do you think in your analysis that the problems
surrounding abusive patent litigation are the result of certain
plaintiff-friendly judicial districts?
Ms. Lee. The question one more time?
Mr. Forbes. Yeah, do you think that the problems
surrounding abusive patent litigation is the result of certain
plaintiff-friendly judicial districts?
Ms. Lee. I think the system would benefit by consistency
across all Federal districts.
Mr. Forbes. What can Congress do to send a better message
to those districts to get that consistency?
Ms. Lee. All the issues that you're considering in H.R. 9.
Mr. Forbes. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
Mr. Issa. Would the gentleman yield?
Mr. Forbes. I would be happy to.
Mr. Issa. I want to follow up on what Mr. Conyers said
about, and your response on heightened pleading briefly. If I
understood correctly, you're saying well--and without discovery
sometimes it's hard to know what the, the product in the patent
in suit is really about. In other words, you don't know enough
about the defending product. Is that what you said, that would
affect your heightened pleading in the beginning of the case?
Ms. Lee. I think before you've conducted discovery, it's
very hard to know all the claims that will be infringed or will
be the cause of an infringement.
Mr. Issa. Sure. But let me just be the devil's advocate for
a moment. Let's assume for a moment you have the leave to amend
when you discover more about the product than you knew in the
beginning, and let's assume that you have the leave to add
additional claims. But, as a basic concept, shouldn't you know
everything about what your patent means on the day you file? In
other words, in the heightened pleading one element is, you say
this is what my patent means, which is what you live and die by
whether you're overly broad and thus invalid based on prior
art, shouldn't that be part of the heightened pleading early on
so that you're held by the breadth or the narrowness of your
claim? And don't you know all there is to know about your
patent at the time that you file?
Ms. Lee. So, yes, Mr. Chairman, as the patent owner I know
everything about my patent claim hopefully, or I should. But
what I don't know is how the alleged infringer's device may
work. Many of these devices----
Mr. Issa. Sure. And I know we'll get back to that. I was
taking a limited amount of time. I just wanted to say that from
a standpoint of--often what happens is the breadth of a claim
by the plaintiff, widens and narrows through discovery and even
morphs leading up to the last days of the Markman. So from a
heightened pleading, I believe the bill intended--and Ms.
Lofgren may follow-up on this--intended to both have you
disclose what your patent means and then, of course, what you
believe the product does. I was only asking about the former
part of it, which is, as you said, you do know all about your
product on the day that you filed.
Ms. Lee. You should know about your patent.
Mr. Issa. Thank you. Your patent. Thank you. Ms. Lofgren.
Ms. Lofgren. Well, thank you very much. And, Ms. Lee, it's
great to see you here. And just a quick report, the Silicon
Valley office that you left to come here to Washington is
proceeding apace, and we hope to have it open toward the end of
this year or early next; so thank you for the leadership that
you showed. You really got it off to a great start, and the
people that you have selected to follow through on it are
following your lead. So I didn't want to go further without
thanking you and the City of San Jose for what they are doing
to make this all possible.
I had a couple of questions that have really been asked, in
one case a proposal made to me by somebody in the Valley on
demand letters. Now, in the bill we're doing a study of demand
letters. It was suggested to me by an engineer that if we
simply required all the demand letters to be posted and
searchable, that that would have a very positive impact in
terms of abusive demand letters, and it would allow people who
are being victimized to actually find each other and solve
problems together. What do you think of that idea?
Ms. Lee. That's an interesting question. And, in my prior
life I did a lot of patent licensing. And, I think you have to
be careful. I mean, on the one hand, transparency and
identifying who the senders of large volume, vague patent claim
demand letters is helpful, because if you see somebody else who
has been on the receiving end of that, you can perhaps work
together, et cetera. On the other hand, if I'm a legitimate
business. I've invented something, and my business is
licensing, you know, I oftentimes put some confidential
information, some business information in there; and I'm not so
sure I would want everybody to see all the financial terms that
I'm offering one particular recipient of a letter. So I guess
it depends what is being put in the database; would there be
portions redacted and what the problem is that we're trying to
solve for.
I do believe that transparency and patent ownership
information is helpful. At the time you're doing a design of a
product, you should know who owns government-granted monopoly
rights and make intelligent and informed decisions at that
time.
Ms. Lofgren. Would you just think some more about it and
ask around the office? I know that there is a small business
education outreach information provision that requires posting
of the filings. You know, I just promised this engineer I would
raise it, and it sort of intrigued me as a sort of non-
legalistic approach, although the issue that you have raised, I
certainly do understand that it maybe would preclude it.
I want to ask another question. In 2010 the University of
Michigan School of Law had a law review article trying to
assess the number of patents per product by industry. And what
they found or reported was that the average number of patents
for a pharmaceutical drug is about 2.97 with a median of two
per product and that the number of patents covering a drug
varied from therapeutic classes from 1.79 to a high of 4.23 per
drug.
So in 2012, there was a study by another group that
concluded that there are around 250,000 active U.S. patents
relevant to smart phones, and I think other hardware-software
products are similarly situated. Now, I think as we think about
patent reform and litigation reform and how it hits, we need to
think about startups. We need to think about the pharma-
biotechnical industry, the technology industry, and we value
all of those elements of our economy. The discrepancy, though,
between the number of tech patents and BIO patents makes the
business completely different and makes IT products
particularly vulnerable to abusive efforts.
Now, the TRIPS agreement requires that patent rights be
enjoyed without discrimination as to the place of invention,
the field of technology, and whether products are imported or
locally produced, but it doesn't say anything about the number
of patents per product. I've been thinking, what would you
think about an approach that made distinctions in remedies
between products that have less than 10 patents versus more, as
a way to kind of preserve the value for different industries
without violating TRIPS?
Ms. Lee. Well, that's a very interesting proposal, and I
think it's the first I heard of it, but it's probably worthy of
some consideration; and let me get back with you on that item
as well. I think that's a very interesting idea because if
nothing else, it's clear and it's simple; and it goes to the
issue that there are fundamental differences amongst technology
sectors, but it also goes to the value of the patent for a
product in one industry versus another, which seems to be a lot
of the tension in some of the proposals we're considering. So I
think that's worthy of consideration. Absolutely.
Ms. Lofgren. Thank you. I look forward to hearing your
further comments.
Mr. Issa. I thank the gentlelady. We now go to the
gentleman from the State that candidates in both parties seem
to be flocking to, Mr. King.
Mr. King. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Director Lee. Thanks
for your testimony. I think your responses have been very well
done and on point here today. I'm very respectful of anyone who
can emerge in the patent business, especially as a patent
attorney and then given that there's so much knowledge base
that has to be encompassed to be able to do a real job with
this, with all of the other disciplines plus the legal
discipline added together, and I just don't want that to be
lost on this Committee or the people that are watching this
hearing today.
So these questions get complex and intricate, and there are
a few patent holders in this Congress that focus their
attention on this a great deal. And I would just ask you to
give me a broader description if you could. If you have a sense
of what it costs to establish a patent and get it
commercialized?
Ms. Lee. Yes. In my prior life I was head of patents for a
company, and we filed for a lot of patents, and it does vary
somewhat by industry. And certainly I would imagine in the
biotech and pharmaceutical industries that there might be some
additional costs because you do additional searching to
determine more fully what has been done before.
The most expensive costs for filing for a patent are not
necessarily the USPTO filing fees. Those fees are relatively
modest. It's really the attorney's fees, so the attorney's fees
for writing the application, for conducting, interacting with
the USPTO, and then another big variable is the cost in how
much you spend on doing a prior art search. So when you add
those pieces together, that's the actual cost of getting a
patent; and after that you have to pay certain fees to maintain
it.
To commercialize it, I mean, you have your business people
writing letters, reaching out to various licensees and whatever
cost that is, and if you have to enforce it in patent
infringement in order to get the licensing revenue, average
cost of litigation in patent litigation it ranges from on the
order of millions on up. Right. So it's an expensive endeavor
to litigate. But to get the patent, it's relatively modest,
more modest, and hopefully that answers your question.
Mr. King. Typically, if we were talking about to get the
patent and to commercialize, would we be looking at a figure
typically under or over $100 million?
Ms. Lee. Under or over how much?
Mr. King. Under or over $100 million.
Ms. Lee. Oh, less than that. I mean, it varies. To get a
patent, maybe it is $20,000 including the attorney's fees. I am
just ball-parking right now. And then after that, to
commercialize it, depending on whether or not there is
litigation, on the order of millions, right. $100 million is a
lot of money.
Mr. King. Yes.
Ms. Lee. So, I think in some instances, absolutely,
probably that number could be hit. But I wouldn't think in most
instances.
Mr. King. Mr. Chairman, I have a letter here in my file
that has about 15 cosigners on it that stipulate some of these
costs. I would ask unanimous consent to enter it into the
record.
Mr. Issa [presiding]. All 15 will be entered without
objection.

__________
Mr. King. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Returning to our
witness, I appreciate that testimony. And I also would state
that in some of the discussions I have had with patent holders,
I have seen those numbers go up to 7-,$800 million, or even $1
billion in the extreme cases that are extensively litigated. So
I am concerned that it is getting more and more difficult to
establish a patent, and that this great creative country that
we are is losing its international edge. Do you think that this
bill helps our international edge that we have traditionally
held since the time of the founding of the republic? Or does
it, perhaps, diminish our edge?
Ms. Lee. So I do believe that the issues in this bill are
critically important, that Congress needs to act. And some of
these issues that we are considering in H.R. 9 are what is
needed to make sure that our IP system continues to incentivize
innovation.
Mr. King. Thank you. And then I see also that the bill
allows defendants to join other parties, or other parties to
join the defendant and the distribution of the loser pays
component of this. Would there be any reason for plaintiffs not
to be able to also have that same opportunity?
Ms. Lee. The attorney's fees shifting provision should
apply equally to plaintiff and defendant. So if you are a
plaintiff and you have pursued a case too aggressively, and you
lost and the other side won and won fees, you should pay. If
you defended too vigorously, then you should also be required
to pay.
Mr. King. I appreciate your testimony. And that concludes
my questioning. And I would yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. Issa. I thank the gentlemen. And we now go to the
gentlelady from Texas.
Ms. Jackson Lee. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Issa. Ms. Sheila Jackson Lee. I am sorry.
Ms. Jackson Lee. You had a moment?
Mr. Issa. I had a moment and I got the Texas--you had just
come back and I----
Ms. Jackson Lee. I was in the anteroom here.
Mr. Issa. Well, you were missed.
Ms. Jackson Lee. Thank you so very much.
Mr. Issa. The gentlelady is recognized for a full 5
minutes.
Ms. Jackson Lee. As you know, Mr. Chairman, we do double
duty with our constituents, and we must be in a number of
places. So thank you for your courtesy. Let me thank our
witness for serving our Nation, and particularly let me thank
you for the many in the patent bar who have indicated that they
have found the Patent Office to be responsive and sensitive
under your leadership. So, again, we appreciate very much your
service. Thank you so very much. Can I just start with your
assessment of this bill. Are you and the Administration
supporting it in its present form?
Ms. Lee. In my written testimony, I think we have gone
through sort of issue by issue the areas that we support, where
we think other considerations might be taken. We are generally
supportive of the goal. And many of the issues here, in one
form or another, we believe are necessary to ensure meaningful
and balanced reforms necessary to continue to incentivize
innovation in the United States.
Ms. Jackson Lee. I think that is a very important point. I
am going to have a series of questions. I know the Chairman is
listening intently, that it will be important as we proceed
with a markup.
Mr. Issa. And the sooner the better.
Ms. Jackson Lee. That we are open to the concerns expressed
in your testimony and some of the concerns that we will be
expressing as we go through this. Let me ask the Chairman to
allow me to submit into the record a letter from the Texas
Bankers Association, I am submitting it as a Texan, and on
April 13, 2015, to let the Texas Bankers Association know that
we are concerned of their issues and we will discuss the merits
of the issues, but we are concerned of their issues. Ask
unanimous consent to put this letter into the record.*
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Note: The submitted material was not received by the Committee at
the time of the printing of this hearing record on June 25, 2015.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr. Issa. The letter will be placed in the record without
objection.
Ms. Jackson Lee. Thank you very much. Let me just ask, Ms.
Lee, on the issue of an increase in abusive patent litigation,
whether or not you believe it has been and how the abusive
patent litigation has harmed inventors and innovation? And
specifically, do you see this legislation mitigating that?
Ms. Lee. This legislation with the various proposals I
think will go a good part of the way to helping to curtail
abusive patent.
Litigation. But I think change will occur throughout our
system; you are already seeing the courts through the court
rulings, including on issues on attorney's fees, including on
issues on what is patent-eligible subject matter, making
improvements to the patent law. You are seeing the USPTO
implementing the post-grant review proceedings which allow
parties to remove patents from the system that should not have
issued. You are seeing the USPTO focus on patent quality.
So, all the pieces and all the stakeholders in the patent
ecosystem really need to work together. And legislation is a
necessary piece of that.
Ms. Jackson Lee. Let me quickly move to my next question.
Thank you very much. I have always raised the question of the
impact of legislation dealing with innovation and patents on
small businesses. So I specifically ask whether H.R. 9 would
assist new and small businesses that often lack the resources
to defend themselves in these very complex and expensive
lawsuits.
Ms. Lee. Right. So in H.R. 9, I think a provision that
would be helpful to small businesses in particular is the
customer stay provision. This is meant to protect the end user
and retailer. So, for example, in the case of the Internet
router and the coffee shop, often times the retailer or the end
user is a small business. So I think there are protections to
be had there for the smaller businesses and so forth. But a lot
of the changes that we are talking about in the patent system,
making sure that discovery is streamlined; making sure that
there is heightened pleadings so everybody knows roughly what
the case is about, and ensuring that there is fee shifting
where there is behavior that exceeds that's what should happen
or overly aggressive behavior, pursuing claims overly
aggressively, whether you are on the plaintiff side or the
defense side. All of those have benefits, I think, to players
big and small.
Ms. Jackson Lee. Let me follow up with this question and
specifically go to the USPTO's enhanced patent quality
initiative. As I often hear, there needs to be improvements
made to the quality of the patents at the Patent Office. And so
I want to ask whether this initiative has improved patent
quality? Are there additional steps that Congress should take?
And then specifically, I want to ask if you would comment
on whether H.R. 9 properly assesses the kind of research that
is done in universities, particularly those that have
institutes, who have a number of endowed chairs, where there
are professors who are designated, or teams that are designated
specifically for very sophisticated research to be produced. It
comes to mind the universities in my community, but
particularly M.D. Anderson, not an institute, a university, but
it is very much engaged in research among other hospitals that
we represent in the area. So would you respond to that please.
Ms. Lee. We certainly need to do all that we can to
continue to ensure that our universities are an engine of
innovation. And I think the changes that we are contemplating
in H.R. 9 give everybody confidence in our patent system. If we
can make these improvements and we can achieve them and we can
achieve the necessary changes in legislation and beyond, to the
extent that everyone has greater confidence in the patent
system, that will benefit universities, that will benefit
businesses and so forth.
And with regard to what the USPTO is doing in terms of
enhancing quality, I could probably go on and on on that topic.
But just let me just say that we have launched an enhanced
patent quality initiative. We had a 2-day summit where we are
looking at everything, internally, externally. We have engaged
stakeholders. We had over a thousand participants. I have
appointed a deputy commissioner for patent examination quality
to focus on patent quality now and in the future. And I have to
say the funds that we have received, because Congress has given
us the right to set our fees and we are now able to, for the
most part, collect the full amount of our appropriated fees and
keep it and have an operating reserve, make a huge difference
in terms of USPTO's ability to be able to focus on initiatives
really long-term, deep initiatives that cost money, like the
patent quality initiative.
Mr. Issa. I thank the gentlelady.
Ms. Jackson Lee. Thank you. And I will just put this on the
record for your contemplation. I hope as we proceed, one of the
issues that I mentioned to the patent director, I am very
interested in small and new businesses. I really want to see an
emphasis through this legislation. And specifically as well,
universities I think need to be addressed. Those are the
innovators, the next level of innovation in America. So I thank
the gentleman for yielding to me and I yield back.
Mr. Issa. I thank the gentlelady. We now go to the next
person from Texas, the gentleman from Corpus Christi, Mr.
Farenthold.
Mr. Farenthold. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Lee,
we have heard a lot of discussion about discovery. And one of
the solutions that has been batting around is a stay of
discovery pending a motion to transfer venue. In your opinion,
is that a good idea?
Ms. Lee. I think that is an idea that is worthy of
consideration. And there is a lot of merit to it for a couple
of reasons. One is that a motion to transfer occurs early on in
a patent litigation case. Oftentimes, it doesn't take long for
a judge to rule on it. And it doesn't involve extensive
discovery on the substance of the patent case. So the claim
construction, the infringement, any of that, you don't have to
touch that. It is oftentimes where is the principal place of
business? Where do they have an R&D center? Do they have ties
to the area? So staying discovery pending transfer, ruling on a
motion to transfer perhaps in combination with the venue
restrictions and tightening that might be a good combination in
terms of really helping and improving the system overall,
whether it be discovery or other abuses that may be occurring.
Mr. Farenthold. Right. Now, I have, heard a lot about how
IPR supposedly knocked out nearly 80 percent of claims. But
looking at the USPTO website, I noticed this chart from earlier
this year, that out of 9,000 claims challenged, 2,200 had been
found unpatentable, which is far less than 80 percent. What am
I missing here? Is the kill rate of IPR being dramatically
overstated?
Ms. Lee. Well, thank you for the question. And, you know, I
think at the USPTO, we keep track of the statistics. And you
can characterize statistics however you would like. Some may
say it is a lot; Some may say it is not a lot. But the bottom
line is our judges work very, very hard to work on each and
every single case. And they look at the facts and they look at
the record and they apply the law in as accurate a manner as
possible, given the case and the record. And I would like to
say that the good work so far, knock on wood, all of the cases
that have come out of the Patent Trial Appeal Board when they
have gone up on appeal have been affirmed. So we hope to keep
up that good record. And we will let the statistics fall where
they may.
Mr. Farenthold. All right. Great. As someone who supports
the BRI standard to weed out weak patent claims, I would also
be interested in finding out ways to alleviate some of the
concerns so that we can preserve it. Is there a reason that
amendments have largely not been allowed to claims, according
to some of the interested parties, at least that is what they
are saying? And is there a fix in place to help deal with this
concern? Also, to use district court construction. And can you
tell me why it is important to repeal the right to amend?
Ms. Lee. Yes. Thank you very much for the question,
Congressman. And the issue of amendment is an issue that came
up when we went on that eight-city listening tour as we
evaluated the Patent Trial and Appeal Board proceedings. And we
got a lot of input on that. And that is one of the issues that
we are looking at, which is we are reviewing the procedures and
the requirements and even the page limits that are permitted in
filing a motion to amend. So we are looking at everything. And
we want to make sure that it is as flexible and as effective as
possible.
Mr. Farenthold. Great. You got all my questions in record
time.
Mr. Issa. If the gentleman would yield.
Mr. Farenthold. I would be happy to yield.
Mr. Issa. Because I think Mr. Farenthold asked a great
question and I would like to follow up on it. If I apply for a
patent and I fail to disclose all the inventors, I could have
an invalidity problem. If I fail to disclose known prior art, I
can have an invalidity problem. If I fail to honestly state any
number of items, the patent is invalid. If I claim a broader
claim than I can have, and I then take that forward and sue
somebody, why wouldn't that be another wrongful act that would
essentially invalidate the claim? In other words, following up
on the gentleman's statement about amendments, when is it too
late to amend?
Is it too late to amend while you are going through the
process of applying for your patent? Of course not. Is it too
late to amend once you have asserted a very broad claim that
really doesn't exist and you are now trying to save your
patent, either before an Article III court or before the USPTO?
If you touch on that, it is important to us because we are
looking at legislation and we want to know do you have the
tools and do you think it is an appropriate balance today?
Ms. Lee. Obviously, during the application process, you can
always pull back on your claims. After the patent issues, as a
patent owner, through supplemental examination, you can always
put your patent back into that process, put it back before the
USPTO, introduce prior art and----
Mr. Issa. You can reexamine your own patent?
Ms. Lee. Exactly.
Mr. Issa. But if, in fact, you go before an Article III
court and you expand the meaning of your patent dramatically,
and then once they accept that, if that is true, then, in fact,
there is lots of prior art, should you be able to amend your
assertion at that point?
Ms. Lee. One more time?
Mr. Issa. Everybody goes through a patent process and they
narrow and narrow and narrow what their patent means. As soon
as they receive a patent, they almost always think that it is a
pioneering patent with broad everything when they look at their
competition. Historically, the Article III courts have been
inconsistent on whether or not you have hoisted yourself by
asserting a broader claim than you should. Because of the
heightened pleading that we are asserting, what level of
accountability should entities have when they receive a patent
by saying I am fairly narrow, just give us a simple patent, and
then they assert it against others and broadly claim that you
violate their patent even though you are much beyond what they
actually claim?
Ms. Lee. Thank you for clarifying that question. There are
rules in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which require you
to make your assertions in good faith after due diligence and
so forth. So if you don't have a basis for bringing the
lawsuit, it is not grounded upon actual diligence and
investigation, and then later on the discovery that you get
about the allegedly infringing product, then you are asserting
the case in bad faith.
And I want to go back and correct one thing. I believe with
regard to go to supplemental examination, you cannot invoke it
at any time. I believe that if there is an IPR proceeding going
on, you can't actually take the patent out of that proceeding
to supplemental examination. So I just wanted to clarify that
as well.
Generally speaking, when there is not anything going on and
you think the patent issued more broadly or maybe you are
getting ready to assert it, supplemental examination is a tool
created to allow you to make sure that your claims are solid.
Mr. Issa. And I think, without trying to do your job better
than your job, because you do it well, if you are in
reexamination by a third party, you can supplement information.
You can actually further say you are absolutely right and I
have discovered something else. But you are right, you can't
take it out of that for good reason. We now have the pleasure
of going to the gentleman from Georgia next, Mr. Johnson.
Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You make a good
point, Ms. Lee, about needing to be specific, complaints,
particularly. And if a complaint is not complete or is not
legally sufficient, one can always file under Rule 12(e) for a
motion for a more definitive statement, isn't that correct?
Ms. Lee. You can amend to clarify.
Mr. Johnson. Well, you can amend and you can force, a
defendant can force someone to amend their complaint by filing
a motion for a more definitive statement. And if that doesn't
work, a motion for judgment on the pleadings. But you, in your
testimony, you state that the USPTO supports the Innovation
Act's limits on discovery, fee shifting provisions, and
heightened pleading requirements. Although I might point out
that as far as heightened pleading requirements are concerned,
that only applies to a complaint filed by a plaintiff alleging
patent infringement. It does not apply to a defendant who can
generally deny, just generally deny the allegations set forth
in a petition or in a complaint. Isn't that correct?
Ms. Lee. That is correct.
Mr. Johnson. And this legislation that we are here about
today does not impose any heightened pleading requirements on a
defendant, just the plaintiff. This heightened pleading
requirement, it would make it harder and more costly for small
businesses to assert their patent claims and, indeed, large
businesses too, isn't that correct? And individuals, be they
rich or poor, it would be more costly?
Ms. Lee. There would be additional obligations earlier on
with the goal of streamlining discovery.
Mr. Johnson. It would make it tougher for the plaintiff.
But the defendant would be left to just generally deny and to
continue to infringe if, in fact, the allegations of the----
Ms. Lee. Well, I think there are benefits here to the
defendant as well. The fee shifting provision is party neutral.
And even----
Mr. Johnson. But the defendant already has the ability to
hold the plaintiff accountable under Rule 11 for fees for
abusive litigation, isn't that correct?
Ms. Lee. I am sorry, the question was?
Mr. Johnson. The defendant already has the ability to hold
the plaintiff accountable for attorneys fees and costs under
Rule 11 should the complaint be found to be vexatious, or not
in good faith or for a number of other reasons.
Ms. Lee. If it rises to that level, if it rises to the
level of not meeting Rule 11 requirements?
Mr. Johnson. I think it is pretty well known that under
Rule 11, courts can award attorneys fees and costs to
defendants to punish plaintiffs from bringing frivolous
lawsuits.
Mr. Issa. Would the gentleman yield?
Mr. Johnson. Yes, I will.
Mr. Issa. Briefly, I believe Rule 11 is against the
counsel, the attorneys for their actions. And this is slightly
different than what we do in the bill. But I know the point you
are making.
Mr. Johnson. Attorneys and parties can be held accountable
under Rule 11. Let me ask this question, ma'am: The Supreme
Court decided six patent cases in 2014, including the Alice
case and the Octane Fitness case which make it easier for
district courts to award attorneys fees and costs to prevailing
parties in meritless cases. And the judicial conference has
adopted rules to raise pleading standards in patent cases to
match those in all Federal cases. And, in addition, the America
Invents Act, which was the largest overhaul of the patent
system in half a century, has only been fully implemented for 2
years. And the AIA's new post-grant inter partes review
procedures are proving very popular as a litigation
alternative. So shouldn't we wait to assess the impact to the
patent system of these new measures over the past couple of
years before we put our thumb on the scale and tip the scales
in balance of patent infringers?
Ms. Lee. Thank you very much for the question, Congressman.
You are right, there are a lot of changes that are going on in
the patent system now. But we still need the legislative reform
on a handful of issues because these are issues that only
Congress can address. And any change that Congress addresses
needs to take into account the changes in the courts, the
changes at the USPTO, the procedures we are implementing and so
forth so that we collectively and comprehensively have
meaningful and balanced reform.
Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Issa. I thank you. We now go to the gentleman from
Idaho, who has been patiently waiting, Mr. Labrador.
Mr. Labrador. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Lee, thanks for
being here. The Federal Circuit recently decided in the case of
In Re: Cuozzo Speed Technologies, which you are very familiar
with, and in that decision, the majority determined that
because Congress enacted the AIA with full awareness of the
100-year-old tradition at USPTO of applying the broadest
reasonable interpretation, or the BRI standard, and gave no
indication that a different standard should obtain, they
decided that the BRI should continue to apply in IPR decisions,
correct? That are coming before the board? Do you agree that
legislative ratification compels application of BRI in board
reviews of patents in different review proceedings?
Ms. Lee. So the application, when the USPTO implemented
these post-grant review proceedings, we implemented it with the
BRI standard and not the district court claim construction. The
idea is that in the proceedings before the Patent Trial and
Appeal Board, we have the ability to amend claims. And
oftentimes when you have the ability to amend, it is in the
public interest, in terms of improving quality, to come to the
applicant or the patent owner with as much prior art as
possible and say you tell me how your invention is different
from the prior art. So that was the thought behind it.
And we are grateful that the Federal Circuit said that we
were within the congressional intent. And all I would say is
that if there is a change to district court claim construction
from the broadest reasonable interpretation, that we revisit
the issue of whether or not amendments should be permitted. If
we are applying district court claim construction, then there
shouldn't be an ability to amend.
Mr. Labrador. That was going to be my follow-up question.
What else should we be looking at?
Ms. Lee. Besides?
Mr. Labrador. Besides what you just said with respect to
allowing amendments in?
Ms. Lee. Well, we are looking at many other aspects of the
Patent Trial and Appeal Board proceedings. We are looking at
the ease and the ability for litigants to amend. We are looking
at how we staff the trials with the judges, whether you get the
same three-panel of judges at the time of institution as well
as determining of the merits. So we are really revisiting and
trying to improve everywhere we can to make sure that those
proceedings are more efficient and more fair, at least within
the congressional mandate to the extent that we can.
Mr. Labrador. And are you advocating for eliminating the
BRI standard?
Ms. Lee. Not advocating. All I am simply noting is that it
is a quality issue. I mean, the broader the pull of prior art
that you bring before the applicant or the patent owner, you
put upon them the opportunity to hem in and tighten their
claims. But whichever way Congress deems is best appropriate as
far as standards go, we would apply it. But just keep in mind
that the standard oftentimes is related to the ability to
amend.
Mr. Labrador. Okay. You have no position. You are not
advocating for a change. And you wouldn't be recommending that
we don't change it?
Ms. Lee. For consistency purposes, I mean a lot of our
proceedings at the USPTO are conducted using the broadest
reasonable interpretation, during examination, during a lot of
our other proceedings. So it would be a little odd, too, if we
had a patent or a claim being construed in a different
proceeding, that is being construed under broadest reasonable
interpretation. But under the PTAB proceeding, it is being
construed under district court. So there is a possibility of an
inconsistency there.
I also flagged the quality issue. But these are
multifaceted issues. And you have to take into account
competing interests.
Mr. Labrador. Thank you very much. I yield back, Mr.
Chairman.
Mr. Issa. I thank the gentleman. We now go to the
gentlelady from California, Ms. Chu.
Ms. Chu. Director Lee, first I would like to congratulate
you on your confirmation as USPTO's new director. As one of
your first acts, you launched an initiative to enhance the
quality of patents that are granted. I am so glad to hear this,
because we often hear about the problem of vague or overly
broad patents. Could you talk about the core elements of the
enhanced patent quality initiative and what you are trying to
achieve? Also, I know that this is one of several actions taken
administratively to address potentially frivolous patent
litigation, and you have stated that legislation is still
necessary to fully tackle abusive patent litigation. Could you
address that as well?
Ms. Lee. Yes. Thank you very much, Congresswoman Chu, for
the question. I launched the enhanced patent quality initiative
last fall. And now is the time to really, for the USPTO, to
focus on patent quality. We have always had it as a priority.
But when your backlog and pendency are going up and up, it is
your first duty to make sure you get that under control. And I
have to say recently, our backlog and pendency numbers have
gone down. And they continue to go down. And we will continue
to drive them down.
And in light of all the discussion we are having here today
about the importance of patents and the abuses in the system,
it is even more incumbent on the USPTO to issue the very best
quality patents possible. So we are looking at a bunch of
things. We have three pillars. One is making sure that we have
excellence in the quality of our prosecution. Second is we make
sure that we have excellence in customer service, of course.
And the third pillar is that we have excellence in terms of
measurement of patent quality. And that is not such an easy
thing to address. But we are engaged with stakeholders. We are
getting lots of ideas from our own internal examiners. We are
going to gather all the ideas and everything is on the table.
And that which we can implement, we will do. That which will
take longer, we will also take a look and make sure we take
steps to do it to the extent we can.
So, that is the patent quality initiative. I am very
excited about it. I can go on much further. But I also want to
get to your second question. The second question was with
regard to frivolous litigation and sort of is it still
necessary in light of all the changes. And as I have said, I
think it is. I mean, there are only certain things that
Congress can do. You have the ability to establish uniformity
across this country where there are variances in district court
application of law.
So we have law from the Supreme Court on the issue of
attorneys fees. And it is being applied, in some cases,
varyingly over the various different district courts. So I
think it would help to have legislation, for example, in that
area for uniformity. That is just one issue. Discovery,
heightened pleading also as well. So there is still a need.
Ms. Chu. In fact, that brings me to my second question.
Many of us here are concerned about the downstream users of
products. Oftentimes they receive demand letters alleging
patent infringement, even though they had no part in
manufacturing the product. You state that there is a growing
need for a national approach to demand letter regulation, and
that at least 18 States have enacted laws on this matter.
Could you discuss what effect this patchwork approach may
have on stakeholders who use and rely on patents? How is
compliance more difficult? And how different are the State laws
from one compared to the other?
Ms. Lee. Thank you very much, Congresswoman Chu, for that
question. I was on the business side, in fact, I did a lot of
patent licensing in my prior life. And if, for example, a
business has invented something, files for a patent, and their
business model is to license patent technology rather than to
manufacture it, think about it, if you have to go into 50
States and reach out to potential licensees in 50 States, but
before you do that, you need to consult the regulations in each
of the 50 States to determine to make sure that your letter,
reaching out to that business, complies with that State's laws,
that is rather inefficient. I am not saying they are different
in all 50 States. But I did have my office conduct a study of
the legislation that had passed and some of the pending
legislation. And while there is a fair amount of commonality,
there are quite a few differences. So that is why, I think, an
even greater need for a Federal standard that is clear, if
nothing else, as a business matter.
Ms. Chu. And, finally, you stress in your testimony that
with regard to customers' stay, customers should be bound or
should be required to be bound by the outcome of the
manufacturer's case. Why do you believe that this should be the
case?
Ms. Lee. I think that is only fair because if you think
about it, you are a patent owner, you have now stayed your case
against end users and retailers while you are litigating a case
against the manufacturer. Let's say you get the ruling you
want. You shouldn't have to re-litigate that case, the same
issues, against every end user and every retailer. That is just
simply unfair. So we are trying to both be fair to the patent
owner, but also conserve judicial resources. That is not an
efficient use of our very limited, very precious judicial
resources.
Ms. Chu. Thank you. I yield back.
Mr. Issa. Could the gentlelady yield to me for a follow-up
question?
Ms. Chu. Certainly.
Mr. Issa. In your case, though, if the manufacturer loses,
you are envisioning that the fees wouldn't come from the
downstream anyway, because you only collect once. So your
assumption is the indemnification inherently goes with the
damages provision, that if you collect from the manufacturer,
you have no further collection from the retailer possible.
Ms. Lee. Yes. Under patent law, you can only collect once.
You cannot collect multiple times downstream.
Mr. Issa. So there is an inherent indemnification in this
process, would you say?
Ms. Lee. I am not sure what you mean by indemnification.
Mr. Issa. Well, if you take on the case, the manufacturer,
and you win, then there is no fee. And if you lose, then, by
definition, you are going to pay the damages on behalf of that
product that was originally sued, is that right?
Ms. Lee. I think that is right.
Mr. Issa. I think that sort of brings an answer to your
question. I now would ask unanimous consent that letters from
Mr. Conyers: a coalition letter from PhRMA, BIO, and others; a
letter from the agricultural companies and organization; a
letter from the Big 10 universities; a letter from several
conservative groups; a letter from the Eagle Forum; a letter
from the Federal Circuit Bar Association; a letter from the
American Universities; a letter from USIJ, the Alliance for
U.S. Start-Ups; a letter from the Medical Device Manufacturers,
MDMA; and a letter from the Innovative Alliance be placed in
the record.**

Without objection, so ordered. As long as I am doing Mr.
Conyers, I would ask unanimous consent that the excerpt page

patent which was granted in March 1951. And it includes some
key information on milestones and the speed and acceleration of
innovation throughout the 18th and 19th and early 20th
centuries. Without objection, so ordered. We now go to Mr.
Deutch.
[The information referred to follows:]
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

__________
Mr. Deutch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to you and the
Ranking Member for continuing the Committee's efforts to
address abusive practices in patent litigation. And I think
Director Lee for being here and offering her testimony and your
expertise. From the start of this Congress, we continue to
explore patent reforms that may be necessary to stop the well
documented and abusive tactics of so-called patent trolls. And
I have long agreed that we have to curb these abuses, many of
which result from a lack of transparency. However, I also
believe that Congress must take care not to push our system of
patent litigation too far beyond the direction the courts are
already taking it. Why? Because in every sector of our economy,
the strength and the reliability of our patent system has
helped drive investment and innovation.
Our goal must be to address the abuses of bad actors
without undermining the work of all the good ones, the
independent inventors, the medical researchers at our
universities, scientists and engineers leading corporate
research and development. And simply to highlight the work that
is being done in 2013; 719 new commercial products were made
available. And the net product sales arising from research
through these products from U.S. universities, hospitals,
research institutions, and Federal labs exceeded $22 billion
annually.
That is what is at stake. And the goal in addressing the
problems is a goal that is reflected by my own legislation, the
End Anonymous Patents Act. My bill would help curb the abuses
of patent trolls who often hide behind a web of shell companies
and subsidiaries in order to avoid accountability. The End
Anonymous Patents Act would require transparency of ownership
and real party interest for new patents, patent transactions,
and updated information as part of regular patent maintenance.
These requirements would go beyond the transparency provisions
in section 4 of H.R. 9, which are limited to disclosure
requirements of plaintiffs who have filed infringement claims
in court.
Now, Director Lee, in your testimony, you offer support for
disclosure by those filing patent claims in court required by
section 4 of the bill. Would you expand on some of the benefits
from expanding transparency more broadly throughout the patent
system.
Ms. Lee. Thank you very much, Congressman, for the
question. And transparency of patent ownership information is
something that the USPTO has looked deeply into and thought
deeply about. And we believe it is a benefit to our overall
ecosystem, the patent ecosystem. We had a number of round
tables in 2013 and 2014 exploring the benefits of patent
transparency, increasing patent transparency ownership
information. And, basically, to the extent that businesses know
who else have and hold government granted monopoly rights, at
the time that they are making important design decisions,
engineering design decisions, they can make a more informed
decision.
If you know that your arch rival competitor has the way of
doing a certain thing and you are never going to get a license,
you are going to do a design-around. Or if you know it is
somebody else and you can get a license, then that will inform
your decision. You can make a better informed cost-benefit
decision,rather than building the product, building the
factory, selling the product, having the product in channel,
and then after the product is in channel, you find out it is
infringing and then having to stop it.
Mr. Deutch. That is very helpful. I would like to shift
gears for a second. You support the joinder and fee shifting
provisions, you have spoken to that. You have also said that
you want our universities to continue to be innovative. You
recognize the contributions that they make. There are concerns
that the universities have raised about losing funding and
incurring fees when they don't control litigation. Can you
address those, are you, is the suggestion that you are making
or that the Administration is making that the concerns of the
universities are unfounded? I would just like to understand it
better.
Ms. Lee. Thank you very much for the opportunity to clarify
it because that is certainly not what I meant. All I meant is
that whether you are a university or you are a business, if you
are investing in a company and that company engages in patent
assertion behavior that is abusive, and later on fees are, they
must pay fees, you have to be careful about protecting the
passive investor. And whether that passive investor is a
private company or a university, if they don't control or
direct the litigation, we need to be very careful not to put
them, or expose them to liability for some of the fee shifting.
Mr. Deutch. I only have a second left. I appreciate your
saying that. The concern as it has been addressed by the
universities is that this legislation would do exactly that.
Are they wrong?
Ms. Lee. Which, provision would do exactly what?
Mr. Deutch. When you talk about the concerns for investors
and what would happen if they are not, if they don't control
litigation and ultimately the liability would accrue to them.
Ms. Lee. If universities are not controlling, directing the
litigation, they, too, should be protected just as private, a
passive investor should be protected, because we want to
incentivize the universities to license their technology out.
We want to incentivize investors to invest in companies and
development of technology. So we do need to make sure we
protect both passive investors or the situation where you have
got a university and they are not actively controlling or
directing the litigation, you need protections for those
entities. Thanks for the opportunity to clarify.
Mr. Deutch. Thank you.
Ms. Lee. Thank you.
Mr. Issa. I thank the gentleman. Now we go to the
gentlelady from Washington, Ms. DelBene.
Ms. DelBene. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And thank you, Director
Lee, for being with us for so long today. We appreciate it. I
just wanted to follow up on the past comments on transparency.
The Innovation Act requires the plaintiff in a patent suit to
provide detailed information about all interests in a patent.
But I understand that the USPTO is currently proposing rules
and holding some of the discussions you just talked about on
procedures that might achieve a similar result through a
different approach. So I wanted to get your feedback on any
insights you have gleaned so far and your views on addressing
transparency through rulemaking versus section 4(a) of the
Innovation Act.
Ms. Lee. Thank you very much for that question. And we did
do extensive stakeholder outreach on some of the transparency
proposed rules that the USPTO has put forth, and basically
concluded that, after reading a lot of input and talking to a
lot of stakeholders, that it is really Congress is in the best
position to enact rules on transparency, because you have
better authority to ask for that kind of information at time of
litigation. I mean, keep in mind the patent has already left
the Patent and Trademark Office, oftentimes for many years. And
we are not, we don't have a touch point with a patent after it
leaves, except for certain very discrete points after it issues
and maintenance fees are paid. But if you want transparency at
time of litigation where there is potential for abusive
assertion and even if you want transparency of patent ownership
information before the assertion of the lawsuit, our view is
that really Congress is in the best position to implement those
laws and rules.
Ms. DelBene. Thank you. I know you are preparing to open a
satellite office in Dallas, I believe, later this year. I
wondered if you could elaborate on the impact of having
satellite offices on your ability to serve innovators, and do
you consider opening any other offices or do you think this is
a good way to help innovators in a local area.
Ms. Lee. I was the first head of the Silicon Valley
satellite offices, Congresswoman Lofgren knows. And I am a huge
fan of the satellite offices. And I think having the USPTO
outside of the Washington, D.C. Area, in the innovation
communities, reaching out to the small inventors, the small
businesses who don't have the funds to fly out to Washington to
participate in our round tables, to provide input on how what
we do affects them benefits all of us.
So I could go on and on. But these satellite offices, as
far as us being able to serve the American innovation
community, better serving their needs and really enabling us to
do the job as best we can are invaluable. And all I would like
to say is with regard to additional offices, I get that
question asked frequently, is that we are focused on getting
those four up and running. And after we are done with that,
then we need to make sure they are integrated into the work of
the USPTO. And we went through a pretty rigorous process in
selecting, we tried to choose across the country to get broad
representation. And I think we have done a pretty good job.
Ms. DelBene. So kind of following up on that, like myself,
I know you spent time with start-ups earlier in your career.
And there was a question asked earlier about small businesses.
But, in particular, you look at it from the view of a start-up,
how do you think the Innovation Act either benefits or gets in
the way, maybe, of some of the work happening at start-ups and
facilitating future innovation?
Ms. Lee. I think addressing the issue of abusive litigation
is critically important to big businesses and small businesses.
But I think it is really important for small businesses because
coming from the start-up world, an average round of capital
venture funding is on the order of several million. And patent
litigations, one patent litigation in that same range, you can
easily see how, if you are pulled into an abusive patent
litigation, that could easily consume basically all your
resources for a round of funding or possibly two.
So I think it is critically important that we curtail
abusive litigation where we can, as best we can. And that is
for the benefit of both the small and the big, but especially
for the small companies.
Ms. DelBene. Thank you very much for all your time and
feedback. And I will yield back.
Mr. Gohmert [presiding]. Thank you. And we do appreciate
your being here. I haven't been able to be here for much of the
hearing. But, Director Lee, we appreciate your service. And as
we have gone through bills in past Congresses, one of the
common things we have heard over and over is we have got to do
something about patent trolls. And as a former judge and chief
justice, I would review the law and go this really doesn't
address what we are being told it addresses. The patent troll
issue still is alive and well. And so here we come back again.
I am curious, what do you think would be the single biggest
help to businesses, small businesses that are named as
defendants who really unknowingly were using, for example,
banks, processing checks, what would be the best way to, or the
best item in any bill that you have seen to address that
particular issue? I think the stay seems to be a big help. What
is your opinion?
Ms. Lee. I think the customer stay is incredibly helpful.
As I described, it tends to benefit the smaller players, the
less patent savvy players. I also think that the Patent Trial
and Appeal Board proceedings provide an attractive, cost-
efficient alternative to district court litigation. And it can
happen much more quickly than district court litigation. And if
a patent is being asserted against you that should not have
issued, with a little bit less discovery and a little bit less
money and a panel of three technically-trained judges looking
at the issue, you may have a solution to your problem.
Now, that is not a guarantee because, of course, it may not
come out of a Patent Trial and Appeal Board, the allegedly
infringed claim may not be invalidated. But I would also say
that all the other factors working together are all needed. You
need the heightened discipline in terms of the actions of the
attorneys in prosecuting and defending these cases.
Mr. Gohmert. Okay. But when we don't have that, then where
do we go? The heightened discipline among the attorneys? That
is why we are in the trouble we are in.
Ms. Lee. Heightened discipline, I mean prompted by things
like attorneys fees and the shifting of attorneys fees.
Mr. Gohmert. So a loser pays system?
Ms. Lee. What is set forth in H.R. 9. And then heightened
pleadings also provides both parties greater information about
the issues in the litigation and, therefore, streamline the
discovery and the motions practice and so forth. So I think you
really need a combination of many of those other pieces. But if
I were to point to a handful that are particularly useful to
small players, it would certainly be the end user customer
stay. It would certainly be, for example, having available to
them the Patent Trial and Appeal Board proceedings. And we have
a patent litigation tool kit that USPTO has stood up where we
pool together resources that all the patent attorneys probably
in this room have access to in their law firms and know how to
get to that information, but if you are not a sophisticated and
frequent user of the patent system, this is a single place
where you can go to get some very, very basic information. We
think that will help too.
Mr. Gohmert. Do you see a shift from first to invent to
first to file? Did you see that being any assistance in dealing
with the patent troll issue?
Ms. Lee. I don't think that affects the patent troll issue
so much. I think it goes to clarity of patent rights. And it
also goes to harmonizing the system in the United States with
the rest of the world. And there are important reasons for
that. But it doesn't really go to the issue of abusive patent
litigation.
Mr. Gohmert. Well, we share that opinion. And that is why I
was telling people making that change doesn't help the patent
troll issue. But, anyway, we obviously have a lot of work to
do. There are lots of businesses that suffer unnecessarily. And
the last thing that I would want to do is eliminate the ability
for entrepreneurs to be encouraged and be properly remunerated
in coming up with their innovation. And so it is a delicate
balance. And I appreciate your servicein trying to pursue that.
I get the impression that is what you are doing. So we
appreciate that very much. I understand Mr. Jeffries will be
next for 5 minutes, recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. Jeffries. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And thank you, Director
Lee, for your service and for your presence here today. I think
we could all agree that the litigation system is an important
part of our democracy in the context of making sure that we
resolve disputes in a manner consistent with the rule of law.
But in order for the litigation system to work, I think we have
got to make sure that disputes that are brought into the
litigation context are resolved or the parties to those
disputes are incentivized to resolve them based on the merits
of the underlying claim, as opposed to, for instance, in the
context of abusive patent litigation, the high, burdensome cost
of litigation, particularly centered around discovery.
So I think what many of us have attempted to do in the
context of dealing with this problem is to address that
discovery issue in a way that is fair to both sides. But I want
to focus on another area that I think raises some concernand
that relates to venue. I think there are 94 district courts
that are in this country. Would it be fair to say that a
disproportionately high number of abusive litigation matters
are brought in just a handful of those district courts?
Ms. Lee. I appreciate the question, Congressman. I haven't
done a study, but I know there is a lot of good work going on
in a lot of district courts in terms of establishment of local
patents rules and active management of patent cases and
controlling of discovery. So I couldn't give you a number.
Mr. Jeffries. I think there was a recent study that
suggested that for a period of time, I believe between 2007 and
2011, approximately a third of patent troll type litigation
matters were brought in just three of the 94 district courts.
So if you will posit that there is a venue problem as it
relates to forum shopping, would you agree that part of making
sure that there is fundamental fairness in the litigation
system is making sure that the matter is being litigated in the
correct forum, is that fair to say?
Ms. Lee. I couldn't agree with you more. As I said earlier,
to the extent that we can decrease the opportunities and
advantages for gamesmanship and venue shopping, I think the
system will be better off.
Mr. Jeffries. Now, when a someone in a party finds itself
in what they believe to be an inappropriate venue, I think it
is section 1404, permits that party to move, to transfer venue.
But if you look at 1404, there is no requirement in statute
that sets forth a time frame within which a district court
judge needs to make a venue transfer decision, is that correct?
Ms. Lee. That is my understanding. And that is why,
perhaps, as we contemplate tightening the new restrictions,
perhaps that in combination with staying discovery pending a
court's ruling on a motion to transfer would incentivize an
early and prompt ruling on that. And if it belongs in that
district, great. It should stay there. But if it doesn't belong
there, it should be moved.
Mr. Jeffries. Well, you anticipated my question. I am
pleased to hear that you agree with that is something we should
at least consider in terms of this Committee. Because if you
have got someone who is inappropriately brought into a
jurisdiction as a result of gamesmanship, resulting from forum
shopping because of a belief that within that jurisdiction,
perhaps in Delaware, Central District of California, wherever
the case may be, because of a belief that justice may not be
served in that particular venue, it seems like before the
litigation proceeds, particularly deeply into discovery, which
is what allows for some to abuse the system and use as a hammer
the high cost of discovery, that you have a decision up or down
in terms of whether you are in the appropriate venue.
I think my time is running out. But let me focus on
something you also touched on with Representative Deutch, and
that is this notion of the passive investor. I think in your
written testimony, you mention that section 3(c) should include
some kind of clear exemption for passive investors, those who
lack the ability to direct or control the company's litigation.
Could you give us some color in terms of who you would view as
a passive investor? How we might define that?
Ms. Lee. That is a hard issue and we will probably have to
spend quite a bit of time discussing the precise language of
that. But drawing the lines that we have roughly--appropriately
would be critically important. What is the definition of
control? What does directing mean? What is directing? What is
indirect? Those are all issues that I think certainly my team
would look forward to working with stakeholders and Members of
Congress to iron out. But that is critical to protecting the
passive investor.
Mr. Jeffries. Thank you. I yield back.
Mr. Issa [presiding]. Thank you. We now go to the gentleman
from Rhode Island, Mr. Cicilline.
Mr. Cicilline. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Director
Lee. Congratulations on your confirmation and congratulations
also on your initiative for the enhanced patent quality. I
think that will bear fruit many generations into the future.
And I also want to thank you for your approach to satellite
offices and hope that you think about smaller and midsize
cities and the impact that a patent office will have in those
communities as well, like Providence, for example.
I want to first turn to the issue of attorneys fees. It
sounded like from reviewing your written testimony that H.R. 9
requires the award of attorneys fees upon motion of a party.
And then the burden shifts to the losing party to prove that
the litigation position was reasonably justified. It sounds
like in your written testimony, you are suggesting that it
makes sense for the party seeking the award to bear the burden
of demonstrating that they are entitled to it. It seems as if
you are suggesting a modification or an amendment to H.R. 9
that would incorporate, designate who really bears the burden
of proof.
Ms. Lee. Thank you for reading my written testimony so
carefully. And you are absolutely right.
Mr. Cicilline. Do you have a recommendation as to what that
burden of proof should be, what the standard should be?
Ms. Lee. How much? We haven't, no.
Mr. Cicilline. I would love to know your thoughts on that,
what the standard of proof should be. And also would you just
sort of tell us why you think that that is the appropriate
place for the burden of proof to rest?
Ms. Lee. In many areas of American jurisprudence, if you
are the party that is requesting some thing, you both bear the
burden of moving or the burden of production, and the burden of
proof, why do you think you are entitled to? Why do you think
the other side's behavior was unreasonable? What specific
elements? Right, at least articulate that. It seems only fair.
Mr. Cicilline. Thank you. With respect to the discovery
provisions, you also, again, in your written testimony, said
that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office believes that there
may be better alternatives for achieving the goal of reducing
excessive discovery in patent litigation cases. Would you share
with us what some of those might be?
Ms. Lee. Absolutely. So clearly, discovery is a big cost
driver in patent litigation. And we support H.R. 9's provision
to have the Federal Judicial Conference look at it and consider
further. But our thought is that many district courts and
Federal districts are taking active steps to manage their cases
and to control discovery. But certain courts are not per
Congressman Jeffries' point.
So to the extent that we can focus on tightening venue
requirements, to make sure that parties are in a jurisdiction
where they have real meaningful ties, where they have an R&D
center, where they have a principal place of business, and they
are not just there because they find that venue attractive for
a variety of reasons that have nothing to do with their
contacts to the location, their business contacts, I think it
makes good sense.
I think it provides an incentive for district courts to
apply the law as is handed down and that you don't get any more
clients because you favor one side or another. So tightening
venue requirements, perhaps in combination with a stay of
discovery, pending a ruling on a motion to transfer would
encourage district court judges to rule quickly and promptly to
get the litigation in the proper district.
Mr. Cicilline. Thank you. And, finally, you made reference
in testimony just a moment ago about what was happening with
the patchwork of demand letters, 18 legislatures have enacted
provisions. And this bill, H.R. 9, has a set of requirements
for demand letters in the context of willful infringement. Does
it make sense to think about those same requirements in the
context of demand letters generally in terms of establishing a
national standard? Should we look at that? And are there other
things we should be looking at that particularly protect the
small innovator, the small entrepreneur who is really
challenged in the current environment and maybe not have the
resources or support staff to defend against or to prosecute
those claims?
Ms. Lee. So does it make sense? H.R. 9 has a provision
which requires, you are not entitled to enhanced damages unless
you identify the patent, identify the allegedly infringing
product, identify the patent owner and who the ultimate current
entity is, and how the infringement is occurring. And I think
those sorts of things would be helpful to have in demand
letters as well.
Mr. Cicilline. As a national standard?
Ms. Lee. Certainly to consider, right, the precise details
and so forth all to be worked out. But there should be some
level of notice, so you avoid the problem of these vague patent
demand letters where you receive it and you really have no idea
what the issue is or what is allegedly the infringing product
even.
Mr. Cicilline. Thank you very much. I yield back, Mr.
Chairman.
Mr. Issa. Thank you. Ms. Lee, I understand that you have a
plane to catch.
Ms. Lee. Who told you?
Mr. Issa. You have a very good staff. We have a second
panel. Is there anyone that truly needs any further questions?
Or can we let the first panel be dismissed?
In that case----
Mr. Johnson. Mr. Chairman, anytime I hear anybody ask that
question, I am always prompted to respond in the affirmative.
But since our witness has a plane to catch, I will defer.
Mr. Issa. I thank the gentleman from Georgia. Ms. Lee,
obviously after today's testimony, the discussion will
continue. I think that a lot of people recognize your
willingness to engage in specific dialogue. And we welcome
that. So when you return from this got to catch the plane now,
we look forward to working with you further on each of these
issues.
Ms. Lee. Thank you. Thank you for your work on this
important bill.
Mr. Issa. Thank you. We will now take a very short recess
to set up for the second panel.
[Recess.]
Mr. Issa. The Committee will come to order. We now welcome
our second panel: Mr. Kevin Kramer, Vice President, Deputy
General Counsel for Intellectual Property at Yahoo!; Mr. Robert
Armitage, former Senior Vice President and General counsel at
Eli Lilly & Company; Mr. David M. Simon, Senior Vice President
Intellectual Property at Salesforce.com; and Mr. Hans Sauer,
Deputy General Counsel For Intellectual Property Biotechnology
Industry Organization.
Pursuant to the Committee Rules, I must ask you to please
rise, raise your right hand, and take the oath.
Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony that you
are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth and
nothing but the truth?
Thank you, please be seated. Let the record reflect that
all witnesses answered in the affirmative.
I want to thank all of you. I noticed you were here for the
first panel, and it was informative for all of us. As you can
see, the second panel might go slightly shorter, but we do have
votes coming within the next hour, so our hope is to conclude
by that time. And with that I'll go right down the row,
starting with Mr. Kramer for 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF KEVIN T. KRAMER, VICE PRESIDENT, DEPUTY GENERAL
COUNSEL FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, YAHOO!

Mr. Kramer. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Members of
the Committee. Thank you for inviting me to testify today. I
appreciate the opportunity to appear before the Committee for
the second time on reducing abusive patent litigation. This
issue is extremely important to Yahoo.
Patent trolls are bad for our business, bad for our
industry, and bad for innovation in America. Trolls are
typically shell corporations that use the law as a sword to
extract money from operating businesses. Businesses that
conduct research, create products, employ people, and take all
the risk of driving the economic engine of our country.
I believe in the patent system, and I want to make sure
that it thrives so that it can be used by operating businesses
for its intended purpose.
Yahoo holds over 2,000 U.S. patents, and we have enforced
those patents against our competitors when we felt the need to
do so. We also have an active licensing program. In short, we
are active participants in the system. Because Yahoo has been
both a defendant and a plaintiff in the system, we appreciate
how very important it is for Congress to get this issue right.
We need a solution to the patent troll problem that curtails
abuse and understands that patents matter.
H.R. 9, the ``Innovation Act,'' is that solution. The
Innovation Act would help reduce--excuse me, would help restore
the balance between encouraging innovation and discouraging
abuse. It would do that by focusing the litigation from the
start, prioritizing important decisions like claim
construction, limiting unnecessary discovery, joining real
parties in interest to the litigation, and establishing a
presumption toward fee shifting for unreasonable cases. These
common sense changes would benefit both plaintiffs and
defendants while giving the courts the autonomy to manage their
dockets.
Yahoo's experience highlights why we need Congress to act.
Between 1995 and 2006, at any given time during that time
period, we faced only two to four cases on our docket. Since
2007, that number has increased almost tenfold, and we have
spent more than $100 million defending ourselves in outside
counsel fees alone in these types of cases. That number does
not include confidential settlements, and it also doesn't
include the untold lost hours of our engineers and others who
get pulled away from projects to do document production, give
depositions and go to trial. All this time and money could be
spent more productively researching new technologies,
developing new products, and employing people. Instead, we
continue to devote time and attention to fighting patent
trolls, and the rest of the industry does too. In fact, patent
litigation brought by trolls remains at historically high
levels.
Unified Patents, which is a company that tracks patent
troll assertions, reported that the first quarter of this year
saw 13 percent more new district court cases than the prior
year. Unified also reported that troll assertions made up 84
percent of new cases against high-tech companies in Q-1 2015,
compared to only 70 percent in 2014.
Clearly patent troll litigation is not going away. Neither
Supreme Court case law, nor USPTO post-grant procedures have
deterred new cases. In our experience, the cases being filed
are still overreaching. For example, Yahoo was recently accused
of infringing patent claims requiring a digital camera
apparatus. We don't sell those devices. Another case was filed
against us simply to provoke a settlement from a third-party
patent aggregator to which we have no relationship.
Cases are also still inefficient. When a complaint is filed
against Yahoo, 90 percent of the time we're left guessing as to
the true scope of the case. We have to spend typically 3 to 6
months of litigation to find out, during which time we spent
several hundred thousand dollars. It takes another 6 months to
a year before the court provides a claim construction decision,
during which time we have typically spent another million
dollars on the case. If we go to trial, that's another several
million dollars on the case. All this points to the need for
Congress to pass H.R. 9. The bill is a bipartisan bill and
makes common sense reforms that would make a real difference.
It includes requiring genuine notice pleading in patent cases,
prioritizing important decisions like claim construction,
providing presumptive limits on discovery, and ensuring that
only reasonable cases are brought.
These provisions would give companies the ability to better
defend themselves against patent trolls. We encourage Congress
to pass H.R. 9 quickly.
Again, thank you for attention to this important issue.
Yahoo looks forward to working with you as the bill moves
through Congress, the legislative process, and I welcome your
questions.
Mr. Issa. Thank you.

Mr. Issa. Mr. Armitage.

TESTIMONY OF ROBERT A. ARMITAGE, FORMER SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT
AND GENERAL COUNSEL, ELI LILLY & CO.

Mr. Armitage. Thank you, Chairman Issa and Members of the
Committee. Thanks for the opportunity to appear here today to
testify. Let me begin right way with the loser pays provision.
I believe the loser pays default rule could be a significant
check on abusive patent litigation practices, whether they're
undertaken by the patent owner or by the accused infringer. It
should in reality make strong patents even stronger and
questionable patents more problematic to assert. I would urge
the Committee to maintain this provision as-is as a centerpiece
of its patent reform litigation efforts.
Second, H.R. 9 would make deferral of most types of
discovery in patent lawsuits until a so-called Markman ruling
on claim construction has been decided, a mandatory provision.
This provision, however, has been criticized even today as
potentially overreaching. However, I think the provision could
be readily recrafted so it poses fewer fairness issues for
patent owners. In this respect the Committee might wish to
consider whether this section of the bill should instead
mandate discovery stays pending resolution of venue disputes
and drop all together the Markman-related provision.
Third, H.R. 9 heightens pleading requirements on plaintiffs
filing patent infringement complaints. This is another
provision where concerns expressed by critics could readily be
addressed while preserving the early disclosure intent of this
provision. Mandatory initial disclosure requirements now exist
under local patent rules in several district courts and apply
in equal measure to both patent owners and accused infringers.
The mandated initial disclosures under these rules track, at
least in part, the heightened pleading standards currently in
H.R. 9. These local patent rules therefore create an
opportunity for rewriting H.R. 9's provisions.
First, the bill could set out a set of heightened pleading
standards that simply mirror the best practices among the
existing local rules and, second, impose new pleading standards
only on plaintiffs where the district court's initial
disclosure rules don't meet the best practices standard. This
formulation could have a number of benefits, including spurring
more district courts to adopt optimal patent case management
procedures.
Next, the customer stay, patent transparency, and judicial
conference mandate provisions in H.R. 9 appear to have broad
support across a wide spectrum of interests. Any concerns that
have been expressed go more to the details of the operation of
these provisions rather than their substance. Further, H.R. 9
contains laudable provisions addressing what the bill
characterizes as abusive demand letter practices that limit the
patent owner's ability to secure treble damages while leaving
unaffected the patent owner's right to be made whole in the
case the patents are found to be infringed.
The bill, of course, has other provisions of significant
importance. H.R. 9 would make needed corrections to the America
Invents Act, the most important of which is correcting a
legislative error that resulted in a too broad judicial
estoppel provision in post-grant review. Tied to this change is
a related provision on claim construction that would apply both
to post-grant review and to inter partes review procedures.
These changes are essential to the PGR and IPR laws. They are
needed to assure that USPTO adjudications on the validity of
patent claims are not premised on the assumption that the
patent covers more than it actually does.
This brings me to the topic of IPR, the inter partes review
procedure. Let me here jump right to the conclusion. Congress
needs to make statutory changes to the IPR process to assure
that this procedure treats the patent owner fairly and to
assure that this procedure has the appearance of fairness. In
my view this can best be accomplished if Congress makes changes
now to the IPR law to provide a presumption that patents in IPR
proceedings are not only valid, but assure that evidence of
invalidity is clear and convincing. I would urge the Committee
to place the issue of IPR remediation at the top of the list of
things to be accomplished as H.R. 9 proceeds through the
legislative process.
My hope is that the hearing today will provide the impetus
for making the adjustments in H.R. 9 that will not only assure
that it will again overwhelmingly pass the House, but also
assure that House action spurs the Senate into moving forward
with its patent reform agenda to the common end of producing
another set of much needed improvements to our Nation's patent
laws. Thank you.
Mr. Issa. Thank you.

TESTIMONY OF DAVID M. SIMON, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT,
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, SALESFORCE.COM

Mr. Simon. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Members of the
Committee. I appreciate the opportunity to talk to you about
H.R. 9, which addresses the abuses in the patent litigation
system. It is a problem that I have been talking to this
Committee about since 2002.
My name is David Simon. I'm the Senior Vice President for
Intellectual Property, for IP, at Salesforce, which Forbes has
named for an unprecedented 4 years the most innovative company
in the world. So I understand the importance of having good
intellectual property laws to protect that innovation. At the
same time, I also understand there is a need for balance to
protect that.
The result of not having the appropriate balance in my view
has resulted in too much money being made available for people
who speculate on the patent system and their financiers who
finance their use of litigation inefficiencies that results in
an unfair tax on American industry.
We really appreciated the AIA, which helped address many
patent quality issues, though many more unfortunately remain.
But in the 4 years since the passage of the AIA, the problem
has not gotten better with patent abuse. It has gotten worse.
It has gone from Silicon Valley to Main Street. We think H.R. 9
takes a balanced approach in trying to address some of these
problems.
First, I would like to highlight the provision that stays
discovery until the scope of the government monopoly is spelled
out. Taking FCC monopolies as a comparison, with an FCC grant,
the exact amounts in spectrum is clearly defined. Patents
depend on words which inherently are ambiguous, as we all know.
We think before permitting parties to launch into a multi-
million dollar discovery effort that tends to place almost all
the burdens on the defendant, we should know what rights has
the government actually granted. Get that district court to
tell us what that is. We think that's fair and balanced. We
also think it exempts companies who have government-imposed
deadlines on the uses of their patents, and it also has carve
outs for competitive litigation. So, we think it's a great
provision.
Second, pleading. Just one of many egregious examples of
boilerplate pleadings in my written statement where you don't
know whose product is at issue, whether it's even your product
that is at issue, and what product it is, what claims you're
being sued on, which could be one of hundreds of claims in a
patent, et cetera. This needs to stop. Some opponents of this
legislation have said the dropping of Form 18 of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure is sufficient. We disagree vehemently.
First of all, until we go through at least a decade of
litigation, no one will know what exactly is required for
pleading. Section 3 of the Act spells it out in clear detail.
We think that is far better to have that specifics because
otherwise what will happen, as several Members have alluded to
earlier, is you will get forum shopping. People will go to
those jurisdictions that will have the lowest standard,
plaintiffs will. And that will lead to even more forum shopping
given that, at least last year, 70 percent of all NPE
litigation was brought in two districts.
Finally, the third provision I think is what the attorney's
fees provision does, which goes far beyond what the Supreme
Court has done. First of all, it forces shell companies to
reveal who their investors are so we now know who is financing
the litigation. Secondly, it says if you have been responsible
for financing unjustified litigation, being involved in that
litigation, you are personally accountable for it. We think all
of that helps make patent litigation fairer. It makes things
clearer. It will get people to behave better because we will
know who they are. So we think that is another huge step
forward.
In sum, we are at, from my personal view, approaching the
end of what I hope to be a 13-year process, because I'm sure
you're very tired of seeing me back.
Mr. Issa. No. We're just beginning to get warmed up. We can
do this for decades, but would like to do incremental
legislation.
Mr. Simon. I appreciate that, Mr. Chairman. This bill has
already been amended many times to address the concerns of
multiple stakeholders. We hope you see fit to pass the bill,
and I am happy to answer any questions. Thank you.
Mr. Issa. Thank you.

TESTIMONY OF HANS SAUER, DEPUTY GENERAL COUNSEL FOR
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ORGANIZATION

Mr. Sauer. Chairman Issa, Members of the Committee, thank
you for the opportunity to testify here today. The
biotechnology industry supports this Committee's efforts to
protect the patent system from opportunists who seek only their
own financial gain without promoting innovation. And in
scrutinizing dubious practices by some patentholders, Congress
should not overlook abuses by others who are undermining the
patent system for similarly illegitimate reasons, whether these
occur in the courts or at the USPTO, whether by patent owners
or against patent owners.
Unfortunately misuse of the patent system against patent
owners is also a real and growing problem. In particular the
USPTO's inter partes review system of administrative patent
challenges is undermining the value and predictability of
longstanding investment-backed patent rights. Questionable
entities have begun to approach biotech companies with threats
of dragging their key patents into IPR proceedings unless
payments are made. And recently the Wall Street Journal
reported on a speculation scheme that involves taking a short
position in the stock of a biotech company and then challenging
its key patents in IPR proceedings to drive down the company's
stock.
Hedge funds have already targeted multiple biotech
companies using this strategy in just the past 2 months and
have promised many more. The first victim was a small biotech
company whose main product is a new drug that helps patients
with multiple sclerosis walk better. This company lost more
than $150 million, over 10 percent of its market
capitalization, on the day the IPR challenge was filed. I want
to emphasize there has been no finding that these patents are
invalid. The Patent Office has not yet even agreed to accept
the petition, but to the company, the damage was done.
Markets react in this way because the IPR system unfairly
stacks the deck against patent owners in many ways, leading to
patent invalidation rates clearly exceeding those seen in
district court patent litigation. Investors have become acutely
aware of these high invalidation rates and are now routinely
raising questions about possible IPR proceedings when
evaluating a proposed deal. This is a disturbing development
for a process that very few people had heard of just 1 year
ago, and it shows just how necessary it is for Congress to
restore balance to this system quickly.
H.R. 9 contains one necessary change requiring the Patent
Office to use the same claim interpretation approach as would
be used in district court, but any final bill must go further
to ensure that the IPR process can no longer be gamed to the
unfair detriment of patent owners.
With respect to broader patent reform, we believe consensus
can be achieved on a range of issues, including enhancing
transparency of patent ownership and enforcement, curtailing
unfair deceptive demand letters, addressing how patents can be
enforced against blameless end users or consumers of infringing
products, and making the IPR system more balanced and fair.
Biotech companies both assert and defend against patents.
Eighty percent are small pre-commercial companies that well
understand the need for balanced opportunities to resolve
patent disputes.
We remain concerned, however, and therefore that certain
proposals contained in H.R. 9 lack this requisite balance as
currently drafted. Exhaustive pleading requirements, mandatory
stays of merits discovery, customer stays that would allow
infringing manufacturers to deflect lawsuits to others higher
up in the supply chain, enjoinder of unwilling third parties
under the threat of attorney fee awards unduly raise the cost
and risk of patent enforcement for all patent owners, not just
so-called patent trolls.
Without predictable and enforceable patents, many investors
would decrease or stop investing in biotech innovation,
degrading our ability to provide solutions to the most pressing
challenges faced by this Nation today.
This Committee should also not ignore a series of
developments in patent law over the past 2 years that have
clearly trended toward more protections for accused patent
infringers. Today patents are litigated at lower rates and are
invalidated at higher rates than when the Innovation Act was
first conceived. Just yesterday the Federal Circuit Bar
Association reported that attorney fee awards have tripled
since Octane Fitness was decided. And this, however, does not
mean that Congress should not act to curb abusive practices.
Rather these changes do reenforce the need to ensure that any
patent legislative package does not swing the pendulum too far
in any direction.
In closing, BIO believes that the Congress can play an
important role in bringing together diverse stakeholders to
reach reasonable compromises, as it did in the 2011 Leahy-Smith
America Invents Act, and as it is doing in the current
companion Senate process. A process that has been inclusive and
that has made substantial progress in narrowing differences.
For example, BIO has worked with Senator Hatch and a group of
high tech and university stakeholders to develop an alternative
construct that addresses attorney fee awards from patent shell
companies.
We are optimistic that targeted solutions that address
other practices of entities who unfairly enforce or attack
patents can similarly be achieved, and I look forward to your
questions. Thank you.
Mr. Issa. Thank you.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Sauer follows:]

__________
Mr. Issa. I'm going to hold to a strict 5 minutes in hopes
that we get everyone in before the vote occurs. I also will
waive asking my questions first. I would caution the four
witnesses also, that there are many questions, so if you're
asked a question, answer it as briefly as you can; and others
weigh in only if the person asking the question would like
additional answers. And that will allow a maximum number of
questions. We'll get as much in as we can. And with that I'll
go to Mr. Franks of Arizona.
Mr. Franks. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Sauer, I'm
going to ask you the questions first here. Could you please
just speak to your thoughts in general on the value of
intellectual property, specifically patents in driving
innovation and economic growth in the United States. I know
that's the blooming obvious question of the century, but I'd
love to have it restated.
Mr. Sauer. Well to an industry that's as dependent on
outside investments as the biotech industry, and we feel we are
extremely dependent on investors. Bringing a biotech medicine
to market takes an average fully capitalized investment of $1.2
billion. That kind of investment over a decade before a product
reaches the market cannot be sustained just from the resources
of a single company alone. So biotech companies very much
depend on their intellectual property working under a slow
innovation cycle to attract the investment and partnering to
bring these products to market. If patents become more risky
and less easy to enforce, less meaningful, if you will, why
would anyone license this kind of technology? Why would anyone
invest in a company that depends on this kind of IPR to bring
these products to market? That is the driving concern that we
hear from all our members every time a bill is proposed that
systematically raises the risk and cost of patent enforcement
and makes them harder to enforce.
Mr. Franks. Well, I think that's a good answer. The Supreme
Court has been active on patent issues, as you know, in recent
years. One area is fee shifting where Supreme Court decisions
have already led to fees being awarded in more cases than in
prior to those decisions, and it seems like this is an area
where the courts may already be addressing some of the issues.
Another area is the pleading requirements. The Judicial
Conference has recommended eliminating the standard form for
patent infringement complaints, and this would mean that
patents would be subjected to the same higher pleading
standards as in other cases. Do you think Congress needs to
legislate on fee shifting and pleading requirements for patent
cases?
Mr. Sauer. On fee shifting, our members have different
views. We have large member companies who are not just
comfortable, but support the notion of fee shifting; and we
have a lot of small member companies who have expressed the
access to justice concerns that you might perhaps expect. As an
organization as a whole, I believe we're on the fence. Our
concerns about fee shifting relate mainly to the enforcement
provisions that attach to them. Impleader for the purpose of
collecting fees, those have created a lot of concern among our
members, but it's an ancillary issue.
The question of pleadings, nobody disagrees that pleadings
in patent cases should conform to the same standards that apply
in other civil litigation. Our concern with the pleadings is
that in the exhaustive way in which the bill proposes to do
this, H.R. 9, it will allow a lot of gaming, unproductive
litigation, and churn in litigation before the litigation can
even get underway, even in cases where a judge may agree that
there is enough for a lawsuit.
I was heartened to hear Michelle Lee's comments earlier
about perhaps finding a compromise where we talk about pleading
at least one claim of one patent to the required degree of
specificity, and that would mean there's enough for a lawsuit.
And then the disclosure requirements that kick in in patent
litigation would take care of the rest of fleshing out the
case. I think there's an opening there, and I do believe
compromise can be found.
Mr. Franks. Thank you, sir. Mr. Chairman, I'm going to
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. Issa. Thank you so much. Moving right along, we will
now go to the gentlelady from San Jose.
Ms. Lofgren. Thank you very much. Mr. Sauer, you were
describing basically a shakedown using IPR, not lawsuits, in
terms of extorting settlements. Have you seen that now drift
over to actually litigation, as the IT sector has? I'm asking
because there was a Law Review article done about a year and a
half ago that predicted that PhRMA and BIO would be the next
victims of abusive patent litigation.
Mr. Sauer. The answer is not really. So we haven't heard a
lot of complaints from many of our members of being subjected
to abusive litigation. In principle, as Director Lee said, it
could happen in any industry. Personally I do believe in the
biotech industry where the value for patent is so much higher,
that those who would abuse the system for their own financial
gain might gravitate toward using the IPR system which lends
itself very well to attacking specific IT assets----
Ms. Lofgren. Because it's cheap.
Mr. Sauer--rather than bringing litigation. That's right.
Ms. Lofgren. Let me ask a question in terms of money. Mr.
Simon, you talked about--I believe it was you. No, no. It was
you, Mr. Kramer, about the costs that Yahoo is experiencing,
you say a hundred million dollars, and that's not all of it.
Recently the president of the Consumer Electronics Association,
Gary Shapiro, said that, and this is a quote: ``This legalized
extortion racket costs our economy an estimated $1.5 billion a
week.'' I don't know where he got that figure. Can you tell me,
Mr. Kramer, what does abusive patent litigation cost Yahoo just
in terms of dollars and as a percentage of revenue or profit?
Can you answer that?
Mr. Kramer. Sure. Thank you for that question. I can
certainly answer the question of how much does it cost us.
Since 2007, I think we have had about 79 cases. We have spent
on outside counsel fees a hundred million dollars. That's just
on outside counsel fees alone. That doesn't include licenses,
settlements, the time and expense, effort of actually getting
people prepared, collecting documents, going to trial, and
that's just Yahoo. Our competitors have many more cases than we
do, some of them. Some of them have less, but it's been an
uphill battle since about 2007. That's going on 8 years.
Ms. Lofgren. So have you done an assessment of what the
cost--obviously when you're sued it is not just the outside
legal fees. You have got staff time to respond and search for
documents for discovery and a lot of other things. Have you
ever like added it all up?
Mr. Kramer. You are exactly correct. I have not spent the
time to add that all up, but certainly I can say in terms of
man hours over the last 8 years it has been hundreds of man
hours lost to these cases when they could have been spending
time more productively on developing new products.
Ms. Lofgren. Do you have any idea what percentage that is
of your revenue or profit?
Mr. Kramer. I do not.
Ms. Lofgren. Mr. Simon, let me ask you the same question.
Do you have information along those lines?
Mr. Simon. No, I do not have specific numbers that I can
give you, but I can tell you you're right in pointing out there
are many hidden costs that result from this, from the time
taken talking to the engineers to the impact of the engineers
after they're being deposed or having gone to a trial where
they're now gun shy to design things they should be designing.
Ms. Lofgren. Let me ask you very quickly. I asked Ms. Lee
about the idea of having, for example, post-grant review
procedures and the like, tiered rule, so that if you had under
5 or under 10 patents, it wouldn't apply to you. If you had 100
or 1,000, it would. Do you think that's a workable idea? Does
it solve any problems for the different ways industries use
patents? Maybe I should ask Mr. Sauer also.
Mr. Simon. If I understand what you're proposing, is
basically based off the number of proceeds that would apply----
Ms. Lofgren. Patents for product, yeah.
Mr. Simon. Then you would get somewhat different treatment
as a result. I've only heard of that one time before--I
actually think it's a good idea--and it was in a discussion
with a member of the pharmaceutical industry where we both
agreed it was a good idea when we were trying to work something
out. However, we both went back to other stakeholders that
early morning----
Ms. Lofgren. My time is up. I know the Chairman wants to--
I'll just say that certainly PHARMA has a different business
model than IT, and that's important.
Mr. Simon. Yep.
Ms. Lofgren. On the other hand, we're rolling the dice on
who's going to win, who's going to lose; and it might be time
to talk some compromise.
Mr. Issa. Would the gentlelady like to place Mr. Shapiro's,
that article in the record.
Ms. Lofgren. Yeah, I just you a the article in the paper.
Mr. Issa. Yeah, we'll put the article in the record. We now
go to the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Farenthold.
Mr. Farenthold. Mr. Simon, you might as well leave your mic
on. I'm going to start with you. We have heard a lot about
abuses of the discovery system. Understanding that we want to
stop these abuses, what alternatives are available to Markman?
Specifically I'd like you to comment on the proposal to tie
discovery to venue, and how can we make that work or do you
have other alternatives you'd like to propose?
Mr. Simon. Thank you. Although we're very happy with the
provisions in the bill on Markman, there are potentially other
ways to try to deal with this issue. Certainly we have seen
instances where various courts try to do a pocket veto on a
motion to transfer, particularly since motions to transfer are
discretionary. And then they eventually say, well, the Court is
now so familiar with the case the public interests factors
outweigh the private interest factors. So certainly there are
ways to tie discovery on venue and motions to dismiss to
encourage speedy rulings and that we think those things might
be things to consider.
Mr. Farenthold. Great. Now Mr. Kramer, we also hear a lot
about the need for further compromise in this. To me, and I
think Chairman Goodlatte when he started this hearing way back
when, said that H.R. 9 was the result of some compromises. I
think it would be helpful to review the fact. Can you tell us a
little bit about what's not in the bill that the tech community
has given up to get to this compromise?
Mr. Kramer. Sure. Let me first say I fully support the bill
as is. I think that it is a great bill. I think it does the
things we need to do to help solve the problem. Certainly some
things that are not in the bill that the tech community would
support are the venue issue, which you mentioned. Clarity on
damages provisions would be extremely helpful. One of the
things that we see in every case, it's routinely pled--I would
call it a plague on the system--is willfulness. You know, just
because I got a complaint, all of a sudden I'm a willful
infringer. I think I would like to see that addressed too.
Having said that, I think this bill goes a long way to solving
the abusive litigation practices, and I would like to see
Congress act on it.
Mr. Farenthold. Great. And I guess, Mr. Armitage, you're
with the pharmaceutical industry. You all gave up some stuff
that you all would want, too, didn't you?
Mr. Armitage. First of all, I'm here for myself.
Mr. Farenthold. You're familiar with it. I guess we've got
to ask Mr. Sauer, if you'd rather punt that question.
Mr. Armitage. Let me just say a couple things. For issues
like willfulness, for example, I wish there were a way to go
forward on that because I think frankly willful infringement,
treble damages, don't quite fit as well in the patent system as
they should. Venue is a great issue to deal with. It turns out
every time we have tried we have come close; we have not made
it. Is it worth trying again? I think everybody should be open
to that. You can be skeptical, but please be open to it.
Mr. Farenthold. All right. Mr. Simon, I think the BRI
standard makes some sense for the Patent and Trademark Office.
But there's an issue with amendability of claims as I hear from
some of the biopharmacy industry, so we're struck with district
court construction. Would repealing the right to amend make
that standard more workable from your perspective?
Mr. Simon. Which one of us?
Mr. Farenthold. I'll ask that of Mr. Simon. We'll let Mr.
Sauer, we'll follow-up with you.
Mr. Simon. First of all, the current rules do permit
amendment on a one-on-one replacement. They are very specific
because Congress placed a tight timeline on the Patent Office
to handle these AIA proceedings, and I think there have been a
number of cases recently where an amendment has been granted. I
think part of the problem is that the amendment rules were
adopted from interference practice, which is a truly
specialized practice, and many people didn't understand how
they worked well. I think they actually do work just fine. In
terms of the other part of your question about, you know, going
through the standard in district court, I'm really worried that
the standard in district court doesn't work for the reasons
that are set forth in detail in my written statement. I don't
want to take all that time to go through that.
Mr. Farenthold. I've got about 30 seconds. I'll let Mr.
Sauer weigh in on that.
Mr. Sauer. There is no realistic right to amend claims. The
AIA says there is. The Patent Office has granted as far as we
know 3 motions to amend claims out of 3,000 proceedings that
were requested. I think that will probably require some work.
More importantly, the right to amend claims or the amendment of
claims and its connection to the broadest reason of a claim
interpretation standard historically applies when the Patent
Office examines claims, that is when it affirmatively grants
rights. IPR proceedings are different in kind. They're
adjudications where the Patent Office decides whether the claim
is invalid or not. It doesn't grant rights.
Mr. Farenthold. All right. I appreciate your answer. Mr.
Chairman, I see my time is expired.
Mr. Issa. We now go to the gentleman from Georgia, Mr.
Johnson.
Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Kramer, you cited
79 cases on which you hired outside counsel since 2007. Is that
correct?
Mr. Kramer. Yes.
Mr. Johnson. At a cost of about $100 million. Is that
correct?
Mr. Kramer. That is correct.
Mr. Johnson. What percentage of those 79 cases were
adjudicated in favor of Yahoo?
Mr. Kramer. So we have been to trial in the Eastern
District of Texas four times. We have won three of those
trials. The other one we lost, but we won on appeal. In the
last 8 years, I have won probably 8 summary judgment motions.
The rest of the cases I have settled.
Mr. Johnson. Settled them because they were meritorious?
Mr. Kramer. Typically settlement arises because the
plaintiff comes to a position where economically it makes sense
to settle.
Mr. Johnson. Some meritorious claims in there I would
assume?
Mr. Kramer. I would not be here today saying that all cases
are meritless.
Mr. Johnson. And so all patent cases are not cases that are
brought by patent trolls. Correct?
Mr. Kramer. I would agree that not every plaintiff is a
troll. For example, Yahoo, we assert our patents. I would not
consider us a troll. We are an operating company.
Mr. Johnson. What percentage of cases or demand letters and
cases filed are what we would call patent trolls?
Mr. Kramer. That's a really good question. If a troll is a
shell corporation above anything else, then that's a troll.
Mr. Johnson. Well, now, we can get at some of these shell
companies, judgment-proof shell companies. That's not unique to
patent law, and there are some existing statutory and case law
that provide clear and proven opportunities to get at that kind
of situation, but, you know, I recognize that there is a
problem with patent trolls, but I think that because patents
are so important, they drive innovation in America, and they
contribute to economic growth in this country; and I'm
concerned about slamming the courthouse door shut, particularly
on smaller patent holders who have not acquired the ends or the
finances that a Yahoo would have to be able to pay, say, a
thousand dollars an hour to a law firm that, you know,
sometimes the principals in a company that their sister-in-law
might practice law with one of the big firms that charges a
thousand dollars an hour, so you end up getting a whole lot of
litigation costs like that. But I'm concerned about closing the
litigation door, the courthouse door, on small people who have
invented something. They've secured a patent, and someone, a
big corporate goon, takes it and starts using it and dares you
to sue them because they know that if there's a loser pay
provision in there, Mr. Armitage, that they're going to be able
to pay those lawyers a thousand dollars an hour for a thousand
hours to win the case, as you've done on your four cases you
prevailed that went into litigation, you prevailed. And if the
loser had to pay fees, that would cause a lot of small people
to just not be able to have the burden or to take up the burden
of asserting their own patent claim. Do you agree with that,
Mr. Sauer?
Mr. Sauer. We have heard from our own small member
companies concerns as the ones you've described, yes.
Mr. Johnson. Do you care about that, Mr. Simon and you Mr.
Armitage?
Mr. Simon. Anybody who has a good patent that a large
company is infringing, they get a contingency fee lawyer to
represent them. They need to get a contingency fee lawyer to
represent them.
Mr. Johnson. Go up against that $1,000 dollar an hour
lawyer who is usually going to win the case.
Mr. Simon. Yes, sir.
Mr. Johnson. And then there's a loser pay provision that
prevents the plaintiff, that coerces the plaintiff not to file
that suit. Do you care about that? I guess not. But thank you,
Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Issa. While the gentleman is sitting down, we'll give
Ms. DelBene--oh, I'm sorry. I missed Mr. Ratcliffe. It is your
moment. The gentleman from Texas.
Mr. Ratcliffe. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank the
witnesses for being here today to discuss this important issue.
You know, the phrase American ingenuity is often used to
describe our country. Americans are known around the world for
our can-do attitude and the fact that no challenge is too great
and no invention is out of reach, and this is certainly
stimulated by the assurance that our ideas, including our
intellectual property, are protected. The patent system is so
central to this idea in the American spirit that it's actually
enshrined in our Constitution. I know that all the witnesses
here and probably most of the folks in this room know that our
patent system empowers any individual from any walk of life to
turn an idea into a product and in turn transform our society.
Our patent system is one of the things that has allowed us to
be at the cutting edge of innovation and make us the envy of
the rest of the world. So it is certainly vital that we protect
the patent system and address its abuses, and hopefully that is
something we all can agree upon here today. My familiarity with
this issue started before I came to Congress where I was the
U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Texas, a district
mentioned by Mr. Kramer in answering some of the questions, and
the district sometimes referred to as the rocket docket. As the
U.S. attorney, I often felt that some of the judicial resources
that I needed to go after hardened criminals and drug
traffickers and child predators were instead sometimes diverted
to handle patent litigation because patent plaintiffs, and I
think this is not in dispute, flock to our area because they
saw it as a quote-unquote plaintiff friendly environment. So
Mr. Kramer, you discussed this in your testimony and in
answering one of the questions as it relates to the fee
shifting provision that exists in the current law. So I'd like
to follow-up and ask you whether in your opinion, are the
problems surrounding, from your perspective, abusive patent
litigation the result of plaintiff-friendly judicial districts
like the Eastern District of Texas? And if so, what do you
think we can do here in Congress to send a message to judicial
districts that are tipping the scales in favor of abusive
patent behavior?
Mr. Kramer. Sure. Thank you for the question. Excellent
question. Thank you for all your hard work in the Eastern
District. Certainly I think that forum shopping is part of the
problem. One of the things that Congress can do is put
everybody on the same playing field, and H.R. 9 does that, and
it is very friendly to both plaintiffs and defendants because
it does the things that you would do if you were going to
design a system from the beginning. For example, let's focus
the case from the start. Let's prioritize important decisions
like claim construction, like venue. Let's make sure that we
avoid needless discovery disputes. Let's make sure that we get
all the parties who really have an interest in the litigation
present in the litigation, and let's make sure that the cases
that are being brought are reasonable cases. If they're not
reasonable, then they should not have been brought in the first
place, but so long as a case is reasonable, fees will not be
shifted and that's a good thing. So H.R. 9 does those things.
That's why we support it.
Mr. Ratcliffe. Thank you, Mr. Kramer. I'd like to follow-up
on a point because I've had conversations with stakeholders
across the spectrum on this issue. I have heard from folks who
both support this bill and oppose this bill, and a common
concern from some of them, and specifically universities and
others seem to be on the fee-shifting provision which has been
described to me as a strict loser pays system. As I read the
bill, losers are required to pay only if the claims are not
reasonably justified. But I understand that some are concerned
that this provision would chill the ability of inventors to
challenge infringing parties. So, Mr. Kramer, provide some
clarity for me here. Specifically, does this bill give judges
enough room to address this issue. And can you speak, or will
you speak to some of the folks' concerns that the fee shifting
provision here would deter venture capitalists, for example,
from investing in patents.
Mr. Kramer. Thank you for the question. Let me address the
fee-shifting issue. Certainly the provisions in the bill allow
for the judge to take into consideration special circumstances
and whether it's an individual inventor, for example. So
there's plenty of room in the bill for the judge to make
exceptions, and it is not a strictly loser pays provision
because, again, if you have a reasonable case, even if you
lose, you don't have to pay. So I think it's a good provision
for that reason.
With respect to venture capital companies, certainly when
venture capital companies invest in innovation, they invest in
real products, they invest in jobs, that is all good behavior
that will not be at all affected by the provisions of H.R. 9.
If a venture capital company is supporting litigation for the
sake of litigation, then they may be drawn in for purposes of
the joinder provision for fee shifting if, indeed, they have
sponsored litigation that is unreasonable. And that is the
least I would expect of any corporate entity, any individual.
If you bring an unreasonable case, as a society we should not
really tolerate that.
Mr. Ratcliffe. Thank you, Mr. Kramer. And, again, I have
questions I wish I could ask from each of you. Thank you for
being here. I'm out of time. I yield back.
Mr. Issa. I thank the gentleman. We now go to the
gentlelady from Washington, Ms. DelBene.
Ms. DelBene. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And thanks to all of you
for being here so late on this panel. I guess I'll start with
Mr. Kramer. In Yahoo's experience, how has discovery worked in
patent cases that you've defended yourself against, and what
improvements do you think, if any, are necessary in this
process right now?
Mr. Kramer. Sure. Thank you, Congresswoman, for that
question. I can give you a great example from the three trials
that I attended on behalf of Yahoo in Texas. In each of those
cases there was a discovery period where we produced hundreds
of thousands of pages of documents electronically. In those
cases we used less than 1 percent of the documents that we
produced. So very minimal discovery is actually used at the end
of the day in trial to prove a case. It is an expense that we
could have avoided. In a typical case, I think what you want to
do is prioritize claim construction because in our experience
that is pivotal. It crystalizes the parties' decisions, and
we're able to reach settlement more quickly and easily once we
have that decision from the Court. I think if you push off some
of that unnecessary discovery until you get the claim
construction decision, that's going to help a lot. And H.R. 9
does that, and that's why we support it.
Ms. DelBene. Now, you were just speaking with Mr. Johnson
about the trial you said in your testimony and just now that
you prevailed at three trials and won eight summary judgments.
Is that correct?
Mr. Kramer. If memory serves, yes.
Ms. DelBene. In the last few years, but in none of those
cases were you awarded attorney's fees?
Mr. Kramer. That is correct.
Ms. DelBene. And so with the Supreme Court's decision in
Octane Fitness and Highmark, do you think it would make it more
likely that you would receive attorney's fees if you prevail in
similar cases in the future, or if so, or if not, why not?
Mr. Kramer. I would hope that it would. It is unclear at
this time whether we would prevail certainly in some forums. I
think if you look at the statistics that have been gathered so
far on those fee shifting cases, it is on a forum-by-forum
basis, and that again feeds into plaintiff's choice of forum. A
lot of times I cannot get a case transferred, so it's an issue.
So even if a plaintiff brings a bad case, even with the Octane
Fitness case, I'm not sure that I would get my fees recovered
in that case. The reason is because even though the Supreme
Court granted, they loosened the standard a little in the
Octane Fitness case, in the companion case, the Highmark case,
they said appropriately it was for the discretion of the
district court. But as we know, on a district-by-district basis
it's going to vary, and what H.R. 9 does, is it puts all the
jurisdictions, all the forums on the same playing field, and so
I think that would be a vast improvement.
Ms. DelBene. Do others have feedback on what they think the
impact of Octane Fitness or Highmark would have on future
cases?
Mr. Simon. I guess I was asked this. I think it will have a
mild impact; but, again, the Supreme Court also said two
things. One Mr. Kramer said about it's about discretion of the
court, which means venue becomes all the more important. I
think the second that matters is that it said it's still
exceptional; so it's going to happen very, very rarely.
Mr. Armitage. There's actually some data on the IPO website
where they track each decision on a motion for attorneys' fees.
I think in the month of March, for example, there were 6 cases
in which they were awarded and 19 cases in which they weren't,
more or less.
Mr. Sauer. The Federal Circuit Bar Association yesterday
sent a letter to the Chairman of this Committee giving more
recent updates, and so according to their account, it's more
than tripled the rate. But with that said, what I'm hearing is
I think this discussion would benefit, and especially our
members would benefit from an understanding of how often
exactly, you know, would Congress intend for fees to be
shifted? There seems to be an assumption that under the
standards that are proposed in the bill, fee shifting would be
rare; it would be a very unusual occasion. And what I hear from
the testimony is it's not often enough. It would have to happen
more often. So I would like to get a better understanding at
the end of the day how often is then, you know, is the sweet
spot, because either it's very rare, or we want it to be a lot
more common; but how a lot more common is kind of unclear to
me.
Mr. Armitage. I think one of the virtues of this bill is it
changes behavior. It sets a default rule that you will get your
fees unless your defenses are reasonable in law or fact. And,
therefore, if you're a patent owner with strong patent, you're
likely to be up against someone who will not defend as they
might otherwise have defended if they don't have a good case of
noninfringement against your patent. It makes strong patents
stronger, and basically makes weak patents pretty much
unenforceable because you've doubled down on your attorney
costs.
Ms. DelBene. My time is expired. Thank you very much. And I
yield back, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Issa. We now go to the gentleman from San Diego who
recently named the John Rhoades Federal Judiciary Center in his
district, an expansive complex that normally would have more
patent cases being heard, but they do seem to end up in Texas.
Mr. Peters is recognized.
Mr. Peters. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for your
excellent work on that as well. I want to thank all the
witnesses for being here. I want to thank Mr. Kramer in
particular for spending some time with me on the phone, and I
hope you will continue to take my calls as we sort through
this. Just on those three cases you won, were the plaintiff's
claims reasonable under the standards set forth by H.R. 9?
Mr. Kramer. In my opinion, I think the first case, the
Bright Response case which I believe is in my testimony was
clearly unreasonable, and I should have gotten my attorney's
fees. But I think it's an exceptional case because the
plaintiff essentially came to court knowing that their patent
was invalid, yet they made me take it all the way through
trial.
Mr. Peters. Under the new jurisprudence under the Supreme
Court, would that be a case where a court could consider fees
under a loosened standard?
Mr. Kramer. It would be, yeah.
Mr. Peters. I just think that the point is, sort of
implication from the question from Ms. DelBene was you had
three cases and you didn't get your fees. What's the right
rate? I had the same question pop in my head that maybe Mr.
Sauer did. I want to give Mr. Sauer just a chance maybe if you
would. Your testimony did say and I think your written
testimony and your oral testimony that you believe in targeted
patent reforms, and I wanted to give you a chance to say what
those are, in particular to distinguish them from, to explain
why they would be different from what's in H.R. 9, either in
degree, or also if H.R. 9 is missing any reforms that you would
include.
Mr. Sauer. I will take the last one first. You know, what
is not an H.R. 9 but should be there is we need to talk more
about how to make the IPR proceeding of administrative patent
challenges a more fair and balanced proceeding that has more
due process protections for patentees.
With respect to the Innovation Act, what I heard and that
is shared by BIO's members, is there are a lot of shared
objectives, things we want to do. When we say more targeted
reforms, we don't just mean the ones where we see clearly there
is going to be a good chance for consensus, that is
transparency, that is dealing with demand letters, small
business protections. But we also think that those provisions
should deal with enhanced pleadings. You know, we agree that
pleadings should be elevated to the standards that apply to
other civil litigation. And we can work to make these
pleadings, pleading requirements more targeted.
You know, Michelle Lee testified about this concept of at
least one claim apply to at least one product in a way that
states a plausible claim. I think all these ways will make the
provisions more targeted. Likewise, I was encouraged to hear
the number of alternative ideas to come to grips with discovery
stays. I think that is what we mean with targeting the bill.
Like we urge moderation without abandoning the same objectives.
Mr. Peters. Right. I might also mention that, the question
I heard from Mr. Ratcliffe before he left about venture
capital, that has been addressed by the venture capital
industry themselves, who have indicated that particularly the
personal liability for sponsoring litigation does have a
tremendously chilling effect probably both on the litigation
itself but also on the investment side. And I think that is
something that we should probably resolve as part of going
forward with the patent reform.
And, finally, Mr. Chairman, if we could, Biocom wrote a
letter dated today, April 14, about their concerns with this
bill. I would ask that it be included in the record.
Mr. Issa. Without objection, so ordered.

__________
Mr. Peters. And thank you. I yield back.
Mr. Issa. Thank the gentleman. We now go to the Ranking
Member of the full Committee, Mr. Conyers.
Mr. Conyers. Thank you, sir. I apologize for my absences
during the hearing. But I did want to ask Deputy General
Counsel Sauer a question or two. I apologize to Mr. Kramer,
Armitage, and Simon. In your testimony, you suggest that that
the new impleader authority in the measure under consideration,
H.R. 9, is one-sided because it benefits only winning
defendants. Why do you think this does harm to small companies
and individual inventors if you do in fact?
Mr. Sauer. There are two aspects about the impleader
provision in particular that we believe really interfere with
the ability of biotech companies to operate in their licensing
and partnership and financing ecosystems.
The first is the provision that talks about the notices of
potential liability under the impleader provision of the bill.
At the defendant's option, the accused infringer would get to
send out notices to all the patentee's business partners, the
licensors and their VC companies, to invite those to either
renounce their interest in the patent or otherwise dissolve, if
you will, their business relationship with the patentee or else
be subjected to potential attorneys fee awards. So early in the
case, there is a letter that will come to business partners
that exposes them to liability and has a certain menace
attached to it. That is one. We think that will interfere with
business relationships.
Secondly, the definition of those who could be impleaded,
you know, is quite broad and could capture, for example, VC
investors if they have certain voting rights. It is all those
who stand to benefit from the litigation and have the right to
direct or have the right and direct to control the litigation.
So that captures universities, VCs who have a seat on the
board. And these are the kind of entities that small biotech
companies very much need to do business with in order to
advance their innovations. And so those were the two main
concerns.
Mr. Conyers. Thank you. In what I think was your testimony,
you have described H.R. 9 as an overbroad attempt to deter
abusive patent litigation. But, at the same time, I read into
your remarks that it is woefully inadequate. What should H.R. 9
include other than inter partes review? Is that a fair
question?
Mr. Sauer. That is a fair question because the patent
system has to work for all industries. And as the biotech
industry, right we don't operate in a vacuum. I think it
behooves us to take account of the needs of other industries
for whom the patent system may not work in the same way. So if
you are asking me what else should the bill include, I would
say the bill should include that, which other industries need
to the extent it doesn't hurt biotech and to the extent it
makes for a better patent system that works for everybody who
has to participate in it, not just biotech. So you know, we
want to be quite reasonable in that sense.
Mr. Conyers. I see. Would H.R. 9 affect your member
companies and other small businesses and individual inventors
to obtain much needed funding? Would it help? Or would the bill
have negative consequences for the innovation economy itself?
Mr. Sauer. It would, there is no doubt in our mind that it
would have negative consequences, at least on innovation in
biotechnology because we depend so much on external funding. To
say it again, it takes us more than a decade to bring a product
to market. And once we are on the market, these products are
very long-lived. So we depend on investors' confidence. And
those investors expect that their investments will be secured,
among other things, by patents that are meaningful and
enforceable.
Mr. Conyers. Finally, let me ask you about the suggestion
that limiting discovery is too rigid and would delay litigation
costing plaintiffs market share and potentially increasing
damages for a defendant. In what ways, in your opinion, does
this proposed measure make matters worse?
Mr. Sauer. The proposed measure proposes to stay basically
merits discovery until the court has ruled on the
interpretation of the patent claim. The problem beyond that is
that going into the litigation, at the very beginning, the
parties don't really know what kind of information they need to
discover to even interpret the patent claim. In district courts
that do this often, there are local patent rules that have set
up a streamlined process to get to a claim construction process
and claim construction ruling quickly. And these processes, you
know, lay out certain categories of information that need to be
exchanged by both parties, to both parties with documents to
back them up. I think it would be a good idea for Congress to
look to local patent rules in the more sophisticated districts
for inspiration of how such a streamlined process could be
crafted. Our objective too would be, if we can, to get to a
claim construction hearing in cases where that is necessary
within a year or less. I think that would be a good outcome.
Mr. Conyers. I thank you. And I thank Chairman Issa.
Mr. Issa. I thank all of you. And hopefully I am last but
not least. Did you go? No, you didn't. Well then I won't be
last. Thank you for returning, Mr. Deutch. The gentleman is
recognized.
Mr. Deutch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That is too kind. I
appreciate it.
First, I would like to thank the witnesses for your
testimony today. We are well aware of the serious abuses that
have plagued the patent system in recent years. The question is
what scope of congressional action will stop these abuses
without also endangering America's innovation economy? That is
what we are grappling with here.
The legislation that we are considering is the same as
legislation that passed out of this Committee in 2013. But as
all of our witnesses have noticed, the context surrounding this
bill has changed dramatically. The Supreme Court has issued six
landmark patent decisions related to subject matter eligibility
and fee shifting standards. The standard pleading form for
patent complaints will be eliminated later that year. The
Patent and Trademark Office is in the process of implementing
the America Invents Act to improve patent quality. District
courts with high volumes of patent filing have updated their
local rules. And the FTC is exercising its powers to protect
end users from abusive demand letters.
Undoubtedly, all of those charged with building a strong
and efficient patent system have more to do to put an end to
abusive behavior. My primary concern with H.R. 9, as currently
drafted, centers on the broader litigation reforms. These
reforms push the patent litigation system in a direction that
it is already heading and may result in unintended consequences
that harm legitimate patent owners, including entrepreneurs and
small businesses, independent inventors, and major research
universities. Now, Mr. Armitage, a question for you, section
3(a) of H.R. 9 would add pleading requirements just as the
judicial conference eliminates form 18. And the question is
won't eliminating form 18 impose the specificity requirements
in Twombly and Iqbal on patent cases and won't the pleading
rules in H.R. 9 go further than the pleading standard for other
Federal courts?
Mr. Armitage. One way to compare the standards currently in
H.R. 9 is actually to go read local patent rules that have been
put in place in recent years, look at what the initial
mandatory disclosures are in those rules. I looked at two for
the purposes of this hearing, Northern District of Illinois and
California, and what I discovered is they're great
similarities. What I was proposing in my testimony was very
simple, use those rules as a template for pleading standards in
H.R. 9, have them only apply to those district courts where
they don't actually have best practices in local rules. That
way you would encourage uniformity across district court with
best practices, not have a statutory provision that would be
out of step with Twombly requirements, and probably have much
less concern among critics of that provision.
Mr. Deutch. Okay. Thank you. Mr. Sauer, you note in your
testimony that limiting discovery before claims construction
could delay discovery on merits by at least 12 months. Can you
explain just a bit more from your perspective why this may have
negative, unintended consequences for legitimate patent owners
among your members. And could you give examples of instances
where a delay in discovery would be wasteful or harm a patent
holder's right to defend their property rights?
Mr. Sauer. The delay in discovery could certainly be
wasteful because in the exchange of contentions that Mr.
Armitage described is also embedded a production of documents
to back up these contentions. So, in other words, in districts
where it works pretty well, the parties have to not just work
toward claim construction but also lay bare their theory of the
case and the evidence that backs it up. This is not relevant
just for claim construction. If this kind of evidence can be
developed in a patent case, it is relevant for claim
construction and also often gets the case in a position for
early summary judgment because we discover relevant information
alongside that which is relevant for claim construction.
This is not to say that, you know, there are certain kinds
of evidence that, especially under the modified rules of civil
procedure, you know, which are going to be required to be
proportionate to the needs of the case, the judges shouldn't
take a hard look at the kinds of evidence that should be
produced in every case. Damages discovery may not be relevant
in every case. Willfulness discovery may not be relevant in
every case. Discovery about inequitable conduct may not be
relevant in a lot of cases before liability has even been
established. So that is the response to the second half of your
question. I forgot the first half.
Mr. Deutch. That is a perfectly appropriate response as we
are headed down to vote. And I am out of time. Thanks again to
the witnesses. And, Mr. Chairman, thank you. For giving me the
time.
Mr. Issa. Of course. Thanks for your participation on both
panels. We now get to just me and I am up against the clock
too. Mr. Kramer, Mr. Armitage, Mr. Simon, I am going to ask you
because you sort of have firsthand knowledge of your companies.
Earlier we had a figure that came from Gary Shapiro at the
Consumer Electronics Association and everyone said well, how
did he get that figure. I just want to ask it in a different
way. I did the arithmetic, it is 3/10ths of 1 percent of GDP.
So the question is, is 3/10ths of 1 percent something that, in
fact, you think excess patent litigation could, in fact, be
hurting innovation and, thus, our GDP by that amount? Sometimes
the only way to break something down is to say, you know, 3/
10ths of a cent per dollar, do these trolls and excess
litigation of this sort, does it cost us that, not in actual
legal fees, but in the hit to all parts of it including
innovation?
Mr. Kramer. My answer is that it is a problem. It continues
to be a problem. I have not quantified it in terms of GDP. But
certainly for the high tech industry, we see new cases all the
time. Even if we settle them, we tend to get more. I just won a
case under 101, only for the troll to go and sue me again in
another country on a similar patent, the foreign equivalent. So
this problem is not going away. Because it is not going away, I
think it deserves our attention. Because it is a significant
problem, we should address it. H.R. 9 does that. Thank you.
Mr. Issa. Mr. Armitage, would you say that your time at Eli
Lilly that 3/10ths of 1 percent might have been spent directly
and indirectly related to litigation?
Mr. Armitage. So when I am enforcing a patent that is worth
$20 or $30 billion, no one asks me what the cost of defense is,
that is true. But the problem is that same order of magnitude
of cost for defense applies to patents that, for example, may
only be worth $5 or $10 million. It makes them effectively
worthless. So unless you address abusive litigation practices
across the board, what you are saying to a whole spectrum of
inventors is, go get your patents but they are effectively
unenforceable. Or when you are faced with a patent infringement
allegation that costs millions to defend, you effectively have
no defense. I think that is why we are here today, the
integrity of the patent system is at stake.
Mr. Issa. Mr. Simon, just a guess, you have spent a few
dollars related to troll activity, what do you think it costs
you?
Mr. Simon. Well, I have seen studies that at least I
personally find credible in the tens of billions of dollars. So
the numbers don't surprise me. But however it is measured, for
our company, millions of dollars means lots of engineers, means
lots of R&D, means lots of things we cannot do for our
customers.
Mr. Issa. Okay. For all of you, I am going to ask a final
set of questions and they really have to do with, Ms. Lee. With
the director, we talked earlier about fee shifting. And
throughout the day, there has been a lot of discussion about
shell corporations and so on. She had some concerns. You all,
Mr. Sauer, has some concerns. Let's talk about what a shell
corporation isand so on.
So, Mr. Kramer, I will start with you. When you sue on
behalf of Yahoo, you put the whole company behind it, right?
You don't form a separate shell and stick the patent in there?
Mr. Kramer. That is exactly correct.
Mr. Issa. Okay. And you do control--all three of you in
your roles, you controlled the conduct of the patent?
Mr. Kramer. Correct.
Mr. Issa. Okay. Now, a passive investor, let's see if we
can go through a definition, because it is important to me that
we get the bill right. If a passive investor is somebody who
gives money to a venture and that venture includes the
activities that might lead to suits but also includes, let's
say, a university looking for people to produce the product, to
license, perhaps even that venture is going to produce a
product using that technology, would you say that is a shell
corporation or would that, by definition, shield the limited
partners because it had purposes other than just litigation? In
the current bill and in your history. Mr. Kramer, you have got
the biggest smile, I will start with you.
Mr. Kramer. Yeah, it is a complex fact pattern, number one.
Mr. Issa. The bill does say that if your primary purpose of
the enterprise is more than just the litigation, then there is
no piercing of that corporate veil. And that is where I want to
ask. Because I think we have real questions about what a
passive investor is. Is it an investor in a lawsuit or is it an
investor in a technology?
Mr. Kramer. A passive investor would be the investor in the
technology, right. We should support investment in technology
because that is how we get jobs, that is how we grow the
industry. We don't grow the GDP by investing in suing each
other. And that is the problem. So I think if you have an
interest, a direct interest in the litigation, you have an
active stream of revenue from that litigation, then I think the
joinder provision should kick in. And if the shell corporation
cannot pay the fees, then whoever is backing it financially
should be on the hook.
Mr. Issa. So are the rest of you comfortable with that,
that if the corporation has some purpose other than just suing
and we make that clear, if it is not already clear in the
legislation, you are comfortable with that, that an enterprise
that, let's say, has licensed half a dozen people, is actively
supporting that, and may be developing more technology would be
exempt, even if they have no money, even if their claim was
frivolous. In your experience, are you comfortable with us not
dealing with that part of the so-called troll, you know troll
industry? Because that is the way I think the bill is
structured today. And I think that is what even, Mr. Sauer, I
think that is what you would want to see is that somebody who
is actively trying to do something more than just sue would
find themselves exempt from their investors being at risk.
I just want to make sure that we have got that consensus.
Because I think it is important because that is the intent of
what I think the bill does. And I want to make sure I
understand today, and with Ms. Lee, I want to make sure that we
get the bill to say that in a term everybody understands. So
any final comments? Mr. Armitage?
Mr. Armitage. I think I am with you. Remember, this is a
context where someone takes a patent, asserts it, it has no
reasonable basis on which to assert the patent, it loses, it
has no money, and, therefore, this provision means nothing
unless someone pays. So, I think in that context what you said
is fair. But you can't have too much sympathy for a passive
investor if the only purpose of the investment was to bring
relatively meritless claims on patents of this type.
Mr. Issa. Mr. Simon, you are dealing with a lot more start-
ups, a lot more people who have these sort of one-off patents.
How do you feel about that, you know, that limited protection
that we are giving you to pierce the corporate veil in this
case?
Mr. Simon. Well, given the press of time, I will say I
think Mr. Armitage pretty much stated it very well, as he
normally does, even when I disagree with him. But this time, I
agree with them.
Mr. Issa. Okay. And, finally, you get the last word on this
subject.
Mr. Sauer. And I will keep it short. I think there is a lot
of unanimity trying to achieve the same goals. I do note the
provision in H.R. 9 is different from the one that was in the
Cornyn bill in the last Congress. Right so there are a number
of different ways one can get at this. There is yet a different
provision that is circulating that Senator Hatch is working on.
I think we can make a lot of progress and I would urge maybe
getting a bunch of stakeholders together which I believe has
worked well during the AIA.
Mr. Issa. Well, we are going to continue to do that. And I
want to thank all of you for your testimony. Pursuant to the
rules, I will say this concludes today's hearing. I want to
thank all of my witnesses. Without objection, all Members will
have 5 legislative days to submit additional written questions
for you all and additional materials for the record.
And with that, we stand adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 5:40 p.m., the Committee was adjourned.]

Material Submitted for the Hearing Record

Prepared Statement of the Honorable John Conyers, Jr., a Representative
in Congress from the State of Michigan, and Member, Committee on the
Judiciary
We all agree that the exploitation of the patent process and
abusive patent litigation practices must be stopped.
In responding to these serious problems, however, Congress must not
harm our patent system, discourage innovation, weaken patent rights, or
increase patent litigation.
Unfortunately, H.R. 9 goes too far in its approach. And, for that
reason, I continue to have serious concerns with this legislation.
To begin with, the bill does not take into consideration current
ongoing developments.
For instance, the United States Patent and Trademark Office is in
the midst of implementing the America Invents Act and has undertaken
various efforts to prevent problems of abusive patent litigation. And,
the Office just held a Patent Quality Summit to address the issues
surrounding weak quality patents.
The legislation should also reflect how the federal courts are
changing the patent litigation landscape.
For example, the Supreme Court will soon eliminate the use of Form
18 in patent proceedings, which will lead to the higher pleading
requirements of Twombly and Iqbal.
Recent Supreme Court decisions such as Octane Fitness, which
lowered the standard by which a court may award attorneys' fees, and
Highmark, which gives deference to district court decisions on appeal,
should effectively make it much easier for prevailing parties to obtain
attorneys fees.
And other decisions, such as Alice, which declared that abstract
ideas could not be patented, and Nautilus, which set a higher standard
for certainty and specificity for patent claims, will make it easier to
invalidate many vaguely-worded software patents and business method
patents and prevent the Office from granting them in the first place.
Further, many lower courts are adopting model discovery orders and
guidelines that limit discovery in patent lawsuits, while others are
promoting early and active judicial case management.
Legislation also should not ignore the actions the Federal Trade
Commission and state Attorneys General are taking to stop deceptive
practices in sending vague patent demand letters.
Cumulatively, these various efforts address many of the concerns
about abusive patent litigation.
Unfortunately, H.R. 9 ignores the changing landscape and goes well
beyond tackling abusive patent litigation. It actually weakens every
single patent in America.

H.R. 9's heightened pleading requirements simply
create needless hurdles for legitimate inventors to access the
courts.

These requirements will work an unfairness against patent holders
across the board because they are drafted in a one-sided manner; they
will prolong litigation; and are unnecessary because the courts are
already addressing pleading standards.

The bill's fee shifting requirement favors wealthy
parties and chills meritorious claims. They are drafted in an
over-broad manner to apply beyond patent infringement actions.
They deprive courts of discretion and will confuse courts and
litigants about who is the prevailing party in an action. And,
again, they are unnecessary in light of recent Supreme Court
decisions.

The bill's discovery limitations are counter-
productive. They will delay litigation; lead to greater
expenses for the parties; and are more properly dealt with by
the courts.

Further, H.R. 9 mandates that the federal judiciary
adopt a series of new rules and judicial changes. The federal
judiciary, with its very deliberative rule-making process,
would do far better than Congress legislating changes.

By unbalancing the patent system, we send a signal to inventors
that their inventions are not worthy of full legal protection. And,
overly broad legislation, such as H.R. 9, could engender more rather
than less litigation, while weakening patent enforcement protections.
Finally, legislation to stop abusive patent litigation should
target the underlying issues fostering abusive patent litigation.
One of the most effective steps we can take in responding to
abusive patent litigation is to ensure that poor quality patents are
not issued to begin with.
We need to provide our examiners the resources they need to review
and analyze the hundreds of thousands of complex and interrelated
patent applications they receive every year.
Therefore, we must stop the diversion of patent fees, which has
already led to an estimated $1 billion in fees diverted over the last
two decades. And to protect these funds from a sequester or
appropriators' decisions to siphon money from the U.S. Patent and Trade
Office.
Legislation should also address the problem of the extortionist use
of demand letters. At every hearing on abusive patent litigation,
witnesses have requested a legislative fix to curtail the use of vague
and deceptive patent demand letters.
Yet, H.R. 9 does not do enough to resolve this issue. Legislation
should be drafted to apply to all parties because certain defendants
can employ abusive litigation tactics too.
In responding to the problem of abusive patent litigation, Congress
should do so in a more balanced and effective approach than H.R. 9.
