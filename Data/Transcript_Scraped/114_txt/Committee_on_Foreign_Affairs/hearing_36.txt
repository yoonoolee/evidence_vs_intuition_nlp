THE RELEASE OF UKRAINIAN FIGHTER.
PILOT NADIYA SAVCHENKO

----------

WEDNESDAY, APRIL 15, 2015

House of Representatives,

Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health,

Global Human Rights, and International Organizations,

Committee on Foreign Affairs,

Washington, DC.

The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2 o'clock
p.m., in room 2172 Rayburn House Office Building, Hon.
Christopher H. Smith (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Mr. Smith. The subcommittee will come to order. The
subcommittee meets pursuant to notice to mark up H.R. 1150, the
Frank Wolf International Religious Freedom Act, and H. Res. 50,
calling for the release of Ukrainian fighter pilot Nadiya
Savchenko who was captured by Russian forces in eastern Ukraine
and has been held illegally in a Russian prison since July
2014. One measure is introduced by a Republican, the other is
sponsored by a Democrat. Both measures enjoy bipartisan support
as is typical of the cooperation which characterizes both this
subcommittee and our full committee.
H.R. 1150 is named after our dear friend and colleague for
many years, Congressman Frank Wolf, who retired last year after
34 years of distinguished service. Some 10 Democrats have
signed on as cosponsors of the bill, and the lead cosponsor of
the bill is Anna Eshoo and I have introduced it. We have 80
total sponsors of the bill and the number is growing by the
day. Likewise, 10 Republicans have cosponsored Congressman
Sander Levin's resolution, I among them and in a few minutes I
will say a few words why.
Due to the strong bipartisan support for both measures the
fact that this is, the subcommittee will reconvene following
this markup for a hearing on neglected tropical diseases as
well as scheduling of other events, it is the intent of the
chairman to consider these measures en bloc which I understand
Ranking Member Bass has graciously consented to and Mr.
Cicilline, I think, will concur with that.
All members have copies of these documents before them, and
then after we have concluded our expedited consideration I
would be glad to recognize any member including myself and the
ranking member or any member of the subcommittee for
statements. All members are given leave to insert written
remarks into the record should they choose to do so.
Seeing that we have a reporting quorum present, without
objection the following are considered as read and will be
considered en bloc: H.R. 1150, the Frank Wolf International
Religious Freedom Act; H. Res. 50 calling for the release of
Ukrainian fighter pilot Nadiya Savchenko who was captured by
Russian forces in eastern Ukraine and has been illegally held
in a Russian prison since July 2014; and Smith Amendment 31 to
H. Res. 50 sent to your offices on Tuesday of this week.

----------

Mr. Smith. I move that the bill, resolution, and amendment
en bloc be adopted. All those in favor say aye.
All those opposed say no.
The ayes have it, and in the opinion of the Chair all the
items considered en bloc are adopted. Without objection, the
measures as amended are reported favorably to the full
committee and the staff is directed to make technical and
conforming changes.
I would like to now note that we have completed our formal
consideration of these measures and will recognize members for
remarks. And I recognize myself on behalf of the first bill,
the Frank Wolf International Religious Freedom Act.
Fifteen years ago, Congress had the foresight to make the
advancing of religious freedom U.S. foreign policy and a
priority. It wasn't easy to pass the International Religious
Freedom Act of 1998. I actually was the one who held all of the
hearings on that bill and frankly it was a very tough sell.
There were people in the administration and Congress who
opposed it. But there was a broad coalition that came together
to support the bill, bipartisan, ecumenical and inclusive of
foreign policy experts that made the difference.
The International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 was
authored by Congressman Frank Wolf, and it is largely because
of his efforts that international religious freedom is taken
seriously as a foreign policy issue. But Frank, though
prophetic, was not omniscient. The bill we passed 15 years ago
needs to be updated to match the new challenges of the 21st
century and that is what we are doing today with this bill, the
Frank Wolf International Religious Freedom Act of 2015.
We honor the author of the landmark International Religious
Freedom Act of 1998 by upgrading the tools, training and
resources used by the administration to advance this
fundamental human right. The need to advance religious freedom
globally is more important now than ever. From Beijing to
Burma, Nigeria to Syria to Pakistan and beyond, the need to
protect religious minorities, mitigate sectarian violence and
government restrictions, and counter radicalism and extremism
are critical priorities for U.S. foreign policy.
We see daily headlines of beheadings, kidnappings, mob
attacks, and arrests carried out by ISIS, al-Shabaab, Boko
Haram and many other groups. Ugly incidents of anti-Semitism
are also increasing globally, even in supposedly tolerant
Europe. According to the Pew Research foundation, government
restrictions on the freedom of religion are at a 7-year high.
A robust religious freedom diplomacy is necessary to
advance our Nation's interest in the stability, security, and
economic development of countries we engage with around the
globe. Research shows that where there is more religious
freedom there is more economic freedom, more women's
empowerment, more political stability. Countries that protect
religious minorities find greater levels of social harmony, a
healthy civil society, and economic prosperity.
Spreading respect for religious freedom is the ultimate
weapon against terrorism and societal violence and preemptively
undermines religious extremism. History also has shown that
when the U.S. makes religious freedom a priority in bilateral
relations conditions change without harm to security interests
or economic cooperation. In addition, countless numbers of
religious freedom advocates have benefited from U.S. religious
freedom diplomacy finding freedom, lesser jail sentences or an
end to torture. That fact alone should prick our consciences to
act.
The Frank Wolf International Religious Freedom Act will
upgrade the IRFA of 1998 to better address a growing religious
persecution globally and help the administration and State
Department to better respond to violent extremism globally as
well. The bill will among many other things better train and
equip diplomats to counter terrorism, address anti-Semitism,
which is on a huge rise not just around the world but also in
the United States but particularly in the Middle East, end
religious persecution and mitigate sectarian conflict. It gives
those tools by enhancing the position of the Ambassador-at-
Large for International Religious Freedom now currently held by
the distinguished Rabbi David Saperstein, creating a tier
system for the International Religious Freedom Report's of
Countries of Particular Concern, and creating a new special
watch list similar to the tier system we use in the Trafficking
in Persons Report.
As the author of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act we
have seen, I think, beyond any reasonable doubt by having a
list, a watch list, we're able to put on notice those countries
that should be or are close to being a CPC or Country of
Particular Concern and so that we can begin working
diplomatically to prioritize those countries.
The bill requires annual designations and actions of
countries with severe religious persecution or freedom issues,
allows the President to designate nonviolent, non-state actors,
and that's new, as well, as severe violators of international
religious freedom, and gives him the statutory authority to
sanction individuals responsible for committing those
violations, expands diplomatic training, counterterrorism
coordination and foreign assistance efforts to advance
religious freedom.
The bill also reauthorizes the U.S. Commission on
International Religious Freedom, or USCIRF, until 2021 with the
same language passed unanimously last year in the House.
Despite strong bipartisan support in the House for USCIRF
reauthorization, it did get bogged down in the Senate but it
was finally reauthorized and the legislation was signed by the
President for 1 year.
Finally I want to thank Anna Eshoo for being the original
Democratic sponsor of this bill along with myself and now as I
have said 80 other Members who have joined. Her advocacy on
behalf of religious minorities in the Middle East has been
laudable and important and critical. Ancient Christian
communities and adherents to other esteemed faiths such as the
Yazidis are being decimated by ISIS, and I deeply value her
partnership on this legislation and admire her commitment to
the cause of all those oppressed for the beliefs that they
hold.
Without objection I will add my comments on Sander Levin's
measure to the record in the interest of time, and will yield
to Mr. Cicilline for any comments he might have.
Mr. Cicilline. Thank you Mr. Chairman. I would like to
begin by thanking you and Ranking Member Bass for your
continued advocacy on important human rights issues and for
holding this markup today. I particularly want to acknowledge
you, Mr. Chairman, for your many, many years of leadership on
the issue of religious freedom.
International religious freedom is vitally important and we
need to commit the necessary resources to protect it. All
individuals have the right to choose and practice the religion
or belief of their choice alone or in a community with others
without persecution, discrimination or fear of violence, and
that is why I supported the passage of H.R. 1150 through the
subcommittee today even though there are still some issues that
I believe must be thoughtfully addressed.
I understand that the administration has some concerns
about the text in a number of areas including changes to
internal State Department structure, reauthorization of the
United States Commission on International Religious Freedom
without important reforms, and potential drains on democracy
funding of other important programs. It is also important to
remember that we had trouble moving the reauthorization of the
United States Commission on International Religious Freedom
last Congress in part because the Senate wanted to see some
specific reforms included. I hope we can address some of these
concerns as this legislation moves forward and before a markup
at the full committee level.
I look forward to working together with you, Chairman
Smith, my other colleagues in the State Department, to develop
final legislation that achieves our shared goals of protecting
religious freedom, maintains our support for other important
human rights concerns, and enjoys broad support.
I also supported the resolution today regarding the
imprisonment of Nadiya Savchenko. We continue to see tension
and reports of aggression between Russia and Ukraine and it
will take a tremendous amount of work and evidence of a
profound change in Russian behavior before these two countries
can truly coexist peacefully, and indeed before the United
States and Russia can build a productive bilateral
relationship.
The United States must continue to call out all of Russia's
lawless actions, and the imprisonment of Nadiya Savchenko
defies a basic respect for due process and human rights and
Russia should release her and other illegally detained people
immediately.
I thank you again Mr. Chairman for bringing these bills
before the subcommittee and look forward to continuing to work
with you on both of these issues and hope that we can bring
them to the full committee for passage onto the House floor.
And we thank you.
Mr. Smith. Thank you so very much Mr. Cicilline. Again
without objection I will make my statement on H. Res. 50 part
of the record. This markup is concluded.
[Whereupon, at 2:33 p.m., the subcommittee proceeded to
other business.]
