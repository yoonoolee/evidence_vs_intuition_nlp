THURSDAY, MAY 14, 2015

House of Representatives,

Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health,

Global Human Rights, and International Organizations,

Committee on Foreign Affairs,

Washington, DC.

The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:13 p.m., in
room 2172, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Christopher H.
Smith (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Mr. Smith. The subcommittee will come to order. Pursuant to
notice, we are here to mark up H.R. 2140, Vietnam Human Rights
Act of 2015, and H. Res. 213, Condemning the April 2015
terrorist attack at the Garissa University College in Garissa,
Kenya, and reaffirming the United States support for the people
and Government of Kenya, and for other purposes.
The first measure, the Vietnam Human Rights Act, I
introduced along with eight co-sponsors. It is a bipartisan
bill. It is the fourth time this legislation is making its way
through the Congress. Three other times it passed the House,
but regrettably was not taken up in the Senate. Our hopes are
this year it will be. And the H. Res. 213 was introduced by my
good friend and colleague, Ms. Bass, and that, too, is a
bipartisan resolution that will make its way to the floor very,
very shortly after full committee consideration.
Due to the bipartisan support for these measures, the fact
that the subcommittee will reconvene following the markup for a
hearing as well as scheduling of other events and floor
activity, it is the intent of the Chairman to consider these
measures en bloc. I understand that our staffs have been in
communication, and Ms. Bass has graciously consented to this. I
also that Mr. Bera may also wish to further consult with regard
to the Vietnam Human Rights Act in advance of the full
committee markup with regard to provisions dealing with labor
protections.
All members have copies of these documents before them
which were circulated to you on Tuesday, and after we have
concluded our expedited consideration, I will be glad to
recognize any member, including myself and the ranking member
and our distinguished colleagues to my right, for any comments
they might want to make on the pending legislation. All members
are given leave to insert remarks into the record should they
choose to do so. Seeing that we do have a reporting quorum
present, without objection the following are considered as read
and will be considered in en bloc: H.R. 2140, Vietnam Human
Rights Act of 2015, and H. Res. 213, Condemning the April 2015
terrorist attack at the Garissa University College in Garissa,
Kenya, and reaffirming the United States support for the people
and Government of Kenya, and for other purposes.
[The information referred to follows:]
[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Mr. Smith. The Chair moves that the en bloc items be
adopted. All those in favor say aye. All those opposed say no.
The ayes have it, and in the opinion of the Chair, the items
considered en bloc are adopted. Without objection, the measures
as amended are reported favorably to the full committee, and
the staff is directed to make technical and conforming changes.
I would note that we now have completed our formal
consideration of these measures, and I would recognize members
for remarks that they might want to make.
I would like to first speak to the Vietnam Human Rights Act
of 2015. Although we have witnessed the release of some
political prisoners in Vietnam, we should not be fooled or
deceived into believing that the release of a few dissidents
somehow represents real progress on human rights in Vietnam.
The underlying reality of repression in Vietnam is
fundamentally unchanged. The Government of Vietnam continues to
hold prisoners of conscience whose so-called crimes are only
their attempts to exercise universally-recognized human rights.
Since the State Department removed the Country of
Particular Concern designation with respect to religious
freedom in Vietnam, the situation there has gotten worse, and I
have heard from witnesses at hearings who have spoken of the
particularly egregious situation that exists for ethnic and
religious minorities. Forced renunciations of faith continue,
and people and institutions in a wide range of faiths are
harassed by authorities unless they submit to government
control and interference.
In order to show that we are serious about protecting human
rights, there must be serious consequences for failure to make
meaningful and systemic reforms that should take place.
Increased commercial ties and military cooperation, frankly,
should be off the table unless basic human rights standards are
met. Respect for the freedoms of religion, expression, and
assembly are a minimum. The U.S. must be unrelenting in its
demands for improvement for human rights in Vietnam. If not,
the repression will only get worse.
This piece of legislation would institute effective
measures toward improving human rights in Vietnam. The bill
prohibits any increase in non-humanitarian assistance over 2012
levels, when it was over $16 million, to the Government of
Vietnam unless it makes substantial progress in establishing a
democracy and promoting human rights, including respecting
freedom of religion and releasing all religious prisoners;
respecting rights of freedom of expression, assembly, and
association, and releasing all political prisoners, independent
journalists, and labor activists; repealing and revising laws
that criminalize peaceful dissent, independent media,
unsanctioned religious activity and nonviolent demonstrations
in accordance with international human rights standards;
respecting the human rights of members of all ethnic groups;
and taking all appropriate steps, including prosecution of
government officials to end government complicity in human
trafficking.
The bill would not prevent increased funding to the
Vietnamese Government for certain humanitarian assistance such
as food, medicine, Agent Orange remediation, or activities to
combat human trafficking or child labor.
The Vietnam Human Rights Act seeks to bring balance to any
future strategic partnerships by ensuring that the United
States' interest in human rights, including freedoms of speech,
religion, assembly, and association, and the rule of law are an
integral part of that bilateral relations.
Its enactment will send an unmistakable message to Hanoi
that human rights improvements are fundamental to better
relations critically linked to our mutual economic and security
interests, and cannot be ignored or bargained away.
I would like to yield to any of my colleagues if they would
like to, perhaps, comment on any of the legislation. Mr. Emmer.
Mr. Emmer. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thanks to Ranking
Member Bass for holding this markup on two very important and
timely pieces of legislation. In the last few months, I have
traveled to both Kenya and Vietnam. House Resolution 213,
Condemning the April 2015 terrorist attack at the Garissa
University College in Garissa, Kenya, and reaffirming the
United States support for the people and Government of Kenya,
is vitally important. During my trip I saw firsthand the
devastation caused by the gruesome killings in Kenya and the
diplomatic and humanitarian crisis it left. From security
crises that forced closure of refugee camps, causing
displacement across the country, to the cancellation of
remittances that people rely on, this attack has caused
incredible harm. I fully support the resolution and urge its
passage.
Just last week, I was in Vietnam, and as a co-sponsor of
H.R. 2140, to promote freedom, human rights, and the rule of
law, as part of United States-Vietnam relations. I want to
mention that the nation of Vietnam has made tremendous strides
in the cause of human rights, from what we observed, and that
should not be lost in this conversation. But there is much left
to do. During our trip to Vietnam, our delegation conveyed this
to our Vietnamese hosts, and to their credit, they agreed. In
other words, there is an ongoing dialogue. We must hold them
accountable, and especially in the face of a major trade deal,
it is absolutely necessary we ensure that any advancement in
cooperation is met by continued advancements in human rights. I
fully support both of these important bills and yield back.
Mr. Smith. Thank you so very, very much. Mr. Clawson.
Mr. Clawson. Yield back. Very supportive.
Mr. Smith. I would ask unanimous consent that my comments
on the resolution on Kenya be made a part of the record. I want
to thank my colleagues for their participation and presence
here today. This markup is concluded, and momentarily we will
begin the hearing on trafficking.
[Whereupon, at 2:22 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
