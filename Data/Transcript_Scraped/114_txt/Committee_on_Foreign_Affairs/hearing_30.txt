FTO PASSPORT REVOCATION ACT OF 2015

----------

WEDNESDAY, MARCH 25, 2015

House of Representatives,

Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade,

Committee on Foreign Affairs,

Washington, DC.H.R. 237

The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 1:30 p.m., in
room 2255 Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Ted Poe (chairman
of the subcommittee) presiding.
Mr. Poe. The subcommittee will come to order.
We meet today, pursuant to notice, to mark up the bill H.R.
237, the FTO Passport Revocation Act of 2015.
As your offices were notified yesterday, it is the intent
of the Chair to consider en bloc the following items which were
previously provided to all members and are in your folders:
H.R. 237, as introduced, and the Poe Amendment Number 25, a
bipartisan amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 237.
[The information referred to follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Mr. Poe. Without objection, these items are considered as
read and will be considered en bloc.
I will next recognize members to speak on these items if
they wish. I will speak, and then the ranking member will speak
after, and then those that wish to be heard on this particular
bill.
The recent terrorist group known as the Islamic State of
Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has taken over large parts of Iraq and
Syria, but it is not just in Iraq and Syria that Islamic
extremists have waged war. Recent deadly terrorist attacks in
France, Australia, Canada, Denmark, have reminded us that the
threat of attacks is in the West. These killers are ready to do
what they wish and eager to take their rampage worldwide.
Many of those killers, unfortunately, include some of our
own citizens. In 2015, the Director of National Intelligence,
James Clapper, said that 180 Americans had tried to go and
fight in Syria, either for ISIL or al-Nusra or some other
Islamic extremist group. There may be more; we do not know.
Each of you have in front of you a handout that describes
16 incidents that are known to the public. American citizens
fighting for ISIL in Syria and Iraq are a very real and
dangerous threat to the United States. These individuals are
receiving training that makes them capable of sophisticated
terrorist attacks, and they put themselves under the command
and control of leaders who want to attack eventually the United
States. This isn't a hypothetical threat.
Before Moner Mohammad Abusalha became the first American to
carry a suicide bomb attack in Syria, unbeknown to authorities,
he returned home to Florida as a fully trained terrorist. He
was also a card carrying member of the al-Qaeda-aligned al-
Nusra front. Fortunately, he did not carry out an attack in the
United States, but he could have.
These traitors who have turned against America and joined
the ranks of foreign radical terrorist armies should not be
allowed to come back into the United States unless they come
back in handcuffs.
For these reasons, H.R. 237, the Foreign Terrorist
Organization Passport Revocation Act, is a critical bill at a
critical time. This bill grants the Secretary of State the
authority to revoke or deny U.S. passports for individuals who
are members or otherwise help designated foreign terrorist
organizations execute their reign of terror. We must stop these
individuals from coming back to the United States to do harm to
Americans.
I will now turn to the ranking member, Mr. Keating from
Massachusetts, for his opening statement.
Mr. Keating. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would just
like to thank you for your cooperation, working together on the
amendment, and the opportunity to clarify the authority that
the Secretary of State will have in this regard, and hopefully
this is one more safety net for the emerging threats that we
have and face daily. So thank you, again, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Poe. I now turn to Mr. Wilson from South Carolina, if
he wishes to make an opening statement. And the microphones do
not work.
Mr. Wilson. Good. I am glad that you explained that. Mr.
Chairman, I want to thank you for having this timely and
important markup today. As a member of this subcommittee, and
as the chairman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on
Emerging Threats and Capabilities, and the father of four sons
currently serving in the United States military, I know the
threat of domestic terrorism firsthand.
With the rise in terrorism recruitment through vast
international communications opportunities and social media,
this is an issue that must be addressed now, not tomorrow or
the next day. This legislation makes--takes measures to ensure
that individuals who are involved in or supporting terrorism in
any capacity are not issued U.S. passports and have theirs
revoked if they are in possession of a passport currently.
Traveling under a U.S. passport is a privilege. When an
individual engages in terrorist activity that directly
threatens American families or her allies abroad, they forfeit
that privilege. I support this legislation because I know it
takes an important first step in stopping the spread of
homegrown terrorism, which we have unfortunately seen steadily
rise in recent months.
I applaud Chairman Poe and his work on this legislation,
and I look forward to continuing to work with this committee to
fight the spread of terrorism both around the globe and here at
home.
I yield back.
Mr. Poe. Thank the gentleman from South Carolina. How many
sons do you have that served in the Middle East?
Mr. Wilson. My two older sons served in Iraq, my third son
served in Egypt, and my fourth son just returned from serving
in Afghanistan.
Mr. Poe. Tell them thank you for their service.
Mr. Wilson. Well, hey, their mother did well.
Mr. Poe. Any other members wish to be recognized for a
statement? Mr. Cook of California.
Mr. Cook. Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for this
hearing. I am not going to talk very long, but I think what you
are doing today is something that I actually think we are a
couple of steps behind the terrorists, particularly ISIS, and
some of the other groups in terms of social media, and what
have you.
You have to give credit to this new, ruthless organization.
It is a new form of warfare. And, unfortunately, it is working.
It has worked in Boston. It has worked in New York. It has
worked in other areas. And unless we combat this with some of
the things that are listed here, we are never going to catch
up.
When we are losing our young people that are being
influenced to the point where they are going to go over there
and fight, actually die for a cause which means just--hard to
believe in terms of their values and morals.
So I thank you for this hearing. Thank you.
Mr. Poe. Thank the gentleman.
Any other members wish to be heard on a statement? Does the
gentleman from California wish to be heard on the--making a
statement on this legislation?
Mr. Sherman. No.
Mr. Poe. All right. Thank you. Hearing no further requests
for recognition, the question occurs on adopting the items
under consideration en bloc. All those in favor say aye.
[Chorus of ayes.]
Mr. Poe. Those opposed, no.
[No response.]
Mr. Poe. In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it. The
en bloc items are approved.
Without objection, H.R. 237 will be reported favorably to
the full committee in the form of a single amendment in the
nature of a substitute incorporating the adopted amendments,
and the staff is directed to make technical and conforming
changes.
I want to thank all of our members. I want to thank
especially the minority for their cooperation, and the staff
for all members and their assistance and cooperation that went
into today's markup.
The subcommittee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 1:46 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
