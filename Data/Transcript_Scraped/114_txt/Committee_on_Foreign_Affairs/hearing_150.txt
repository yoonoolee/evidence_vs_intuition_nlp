CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN TO FULFILL

THEIR PROMISES OF ASSISTANCE IN THIS CASE OF

ROBERT LEVINSON, THE LONGEST HELD UNITED

STATES CIVILIAN IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY

----------

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 2015

House of Representatives,

Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa,

Committee on Foreign Affairs,

Washington, DC.

The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 1:45 p.m., in
room 2172 Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Ileana Ros-
Lehtinen (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. The subcommittee will come to order.
We meet today pursuant to notice to mark up the ranking
member's bipartisan resolution aimed at securing the return of
Robert Levinson, the longest-held United States hostage in our
Nation's history.
And so as your offices were previously notified, it is the
intent of the Chair to consider the following items en bloc
which members have before them--House Resolution 148, calling
on the Government of Iran to fulfill its repeated promises of
assistance in the case of Robert Levinson, and Ros-Lehtinen-
Deutch Amendment 31 in the nature of a substitute to House
Resolution 435.
[The information referred to follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Without objection, these items are
considered as read and will be considered en bloc. After I make
some opening remarks and the ranking member speaks, we will be
glad to recognize any other members seeking recognition, and
without objection all members may have 5 days to submit
statements for the record on today's business.
The Chair recognizes herself. First, I would like to
welcome Christine, Robert Levinson's wife, and their son, Dan,
in the audience as well.
I wish I could say that it is a pleasure to see you today
but, unfortunately, seeing you here at this markup means that
it is another two birthdays and another two anniversaries that
you have missed with Bob for 3,261 days your family has had to
cope with not knowing where he is or even how he is.
But just know that we will not give up the fight to bring
Bob home to you and all of his loved ones and friends and we
will continue to demand that Iran honor its commitment and we
will continue to press the administration to help bring Bob
home.
We will continue to raise this issue ourselves, which is
why I am pleased to join the leader in this cause, Ted Deutch,
in introducing this resolution here before us today yet again.
As South Florida residents, you couldn't have asked for a
better and more determined representative for your cause than
Ted Deutch.
I have seen how important Bob is to Ted. His number-one
goal is reuniting him with you, the members of his family. I
can only say that we all support Ted in his efforts.
We will continue to work with Mr. Deutch in his fight for
your family, and because it is an issue that is so dear to Ted
I want to yield the balance of my time to give Ted the
opportunity to speak as long as he wants.
Mr. Deutch. Thank you very much, Madam Chairman.
I want to--I would like to begin by thanking for your
vigorous commitment to bringing awareness to Bob Levinson's
case and always pushing for Bob's return.
I want to thank the many members of the subcommittee who
have co-sponsored this resolution. I would also like to welcome
Christine and Dan to our markup today.
Last month, we received word that our Government negotiated
for the release of four Americans in prison in Iran. It was
welcome news.
These are Americans who were wrongfully held and the move
brought comfort to the families, corrected an injustice and
made very clear that the United States does not forget about
its own people.
Over the years, I have worked closely with Congressman
Kildee, Congressman Huffman and Congressman Labrador to
continue to raise Bob's case as well as those of Amir Hekmati,
Saeed Abedini and Jason Rezaian.
And I am so pleased that each of their constituents has
returned home to the United States to be with their family and
their friends.
Their nightmares are over. Unfortunately, this is not the
case for the Levinsons. For Bob, now the longest-held civilian
hostage in our history, and for his family, this nightmare
continues.
March 9th will mark 9 years since Bob disappeared on Iran's
Kish Island. That's 9 years of birthdays with his seven
children, anniversaries with his wife, Christine, weddings, the
births of three of his four grandchildren and many other
important milestones that should have been--should have been
joyous occasions for the Levinsons that should have been
celebrated together as a family and should have created happy
memories that one carries with them for their entire life.
Today, it is an honor to have Bob's wife, Christine, and
his eldest son, Dan, here. This is a family who for 9 years has
never given up and has worked tirelessly to bring their husband
and father home.
Your family deserves to feel the same elation and relief as
the families of those other Americans who were released and
rest assured we will not give up until Bob is returned.
Bob dedicated his life to serving this country, spending 28
years with the FBI and earlier with the DEA. Bob loves this
country dearly and now this country must come through for Bob.
There have been moments of optimism over the years. The
Levinson family has received proof of life in the form of
pictures and video.
We know that throughout the course of nuclear negotiations
with Iran, Secretary Kerry, Under Secretary Sherman and others
raised Bob's case at every single meeting.
But that is not enough. Whatever information Iran has about
Bob needs to be provided now so that Bob can be brought home.
The resolution before us today calls on Iran to follow
through on its repeated promises of assisting the United States
in locating Bob.
I am proud to introduce this resolution with my colleague
and good friend, Chairman Ros-Lehtinen, as well as our fellow
Floridians, Congressman Diaz Balart and Congressman Wasserman
Shultz.
The resolution recognizes that despite our many
disagreements with Iran, our Government and those of our
partners and allies must continue to press Iran for information
about Bob at every opportunity.
Both President Obama and Secretary Kerry have repeatedly
expressed their commitment to securing Bob's release. After the
release of the other Americans, President Obama stated on
national television that, and I quote,

``Iran has agreed to deepen our coordination as we work
to locate Robert Levinson, missing from Iran for more
than 8 years. Even as we rejoice in the safe return for
others we will never forget about Bob. Each and every
day and especially today, our hearts are with the
Levinson family. We will not rest until their family is
whole again.''

Today, Iran seeks to be part of the international
community. But let us make no mistake, a country that sponsors
terrorism, that threatens to wipe other countries off the map
and that holds innocent Americans hostage will not be welcomed
into the community of responsible nations.
For anyone who is watching this markup online, for anyone
in the audience, I encourage you to tweet about Bob Levinson,
using the hashtag #whataboutbob.
We have got to keep talking about this case. We have got to
raise the level of awareness and we must encourage our
Government and the governments of our allies and anyone who can
be helpful to continue to work tirelessly to find Bob and to
bring him home.
Christine and Dan, please know that the United States
Congress stands with you. We will not forget about Bob. And I
thank my colleagues for the support of this very important
resolution today, and I yield back.
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you so much, Mr. Deutch.
As always, when you speak about this case you do it in such
an eloquent manner. Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts
with us.
Mr. Chabot is recognized.
Mr. Chabot. Thank you, Madam Chair.
I want to commend you for bringing this important timely
legislation before the subcommittee today and I admire your
dedication and Mr. Deutch's dedication in particular and other
members of this committee who have displayed basically being
relentless about bringing to light what happened and where
Robert Levinson is and to bring him home to his family who, as
you have mentioned, is here today.
And as has been mentioned, Mr. Levinson is now the longest-
held U.S. civilian in American history and Iranian officials
must live up to their commitments to work through the case and
release the results of the investigation into Mr. Levinson's
disappearance to the United States.
While I recognize that U.S. officials have repeatedly
called for the safe return of Mr. Levinson and requested
Iranian assistance to help a fellow American citizen, the
administration and our allies must do more.
So I join with both Chair Ros-Lehtinen and Mr. Deutch in
urging the President and our allies to continue pressing Iran
on the case of Robert Levinson at every opportunity, despite
our many unresolved differences.
I urge my colleagues to support the legislation and I yield
back my time.
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you, Mr. Chabot.
Mr. Connolly is recognized.
Mr. Connolly. Thank you, Madam Chairman.
Let me, first of all, express my deep concern to the
Levinson family who are here today and to thank my colleague,
Mr. Deutch especially, and you, Madam Chairman, for keeping
this issue at the forefront of our relationship, evolving as it
is, with Iran.
It is never okay for a U.S. citizen to be detained without
charge, without explanation. Mr. Levinson is the longest-held
American civilian in our Nation's history.
Accountability is important. So if Iran wants to take its
place in the family of nations, if it wants to end its own
self-inflicted isolation, it must account for Bob Levinson.
Thank you both for your leadership.
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you, Mr. Connolly.
Mr. Zeldin.
Mr. Zeldin. I thank the chairwoman and ranking member for
your leadership to try to not only get more information on Mr.
Levinson but to hopefully eventually be able to bring him home.
I had the pleasure of speaking with the family of Mr.
Levinson before the start of today's markup and it is clear
that they are as determined as ever to get answers to questions
left long overdue.
Just last week, Congressman Mike Pompeo, Frank LoBiondo and
I went to the Iranian interests section here in Washington, DC,
to file visa applications.
We sent a letter to the Ayatollah. Part of that request is
to get more information on Mr. Levinson's whereabouts.
Hopefully, we'll have a positive response and I just want to be
part of working with the chairwoman and the ranking member to
hopefully bring Mr. Levinson home.
I yield back.
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you, Mr. Zeldin.
Mr. Meadows.
Mr. Meadows. Thank you, Madam Chairman.
I want to not only voice my support but certainly redouble
our efforts to continue to keep this particular issue that you
and our good friend, Mr. Deutch, continues to raise on a
regular basis.
Fundamentally, that if we allow the American people to
believe that we are going to tolerate a regime that not only
has unbelievable humanitarian atrocities that continue to get
leveled on an almost daily basis but that we are going to
tolerate it as an American people, it sends the wrong message.
And so I just want to thank you for your leadership, thank
Mr. Deutch for his continued involvement on behalf of his
constituency and we will all of us join together in a
bipartisan way to support this effort.
Yield back.
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you, sir.
Does any other member seek recognition on this measure?
Hearing no further requests for recognition, the question
occurs on adopting the items under consideration en bloc.
All those in favor say aye.
[Chorus of ayes.]
All opposed say no. In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes
have it and the en bloc items are approved.
Without objection, House Resolution 148 as amended will be
reported to the full committee in the form of a single
amendment in the nature of a substitute and staff is directed
to make any technical and conforming changes.
I want to thank all of the members and staff for their
assistance and cooperation that went in today's important
markup and we will move on to regular order of our
subcommittee.
And I want to--we want to once again thank the Levinson
family for appearing before us. Thank you very much.
[Whereupon, at 2:09 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
