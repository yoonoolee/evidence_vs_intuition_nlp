WEDNESDAY, MAY 20, 2015

House of Representatives,

Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific,

Committee on Foreign Affairs,

Washington, DC.

The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:11 p.m., in
room 2172, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Matt Salmon
(chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Mr. Salmon. The subcommittee will come to order. We meet
today pursuant to notice to mark up two bipartisan measures. As
your offices were notified on Monday, it is the intent of the
Chair to consider en bloc the following items which were
previously provided to members, and are in your folders. The
first bill is H.R. 1853, To direct the President to develop a
strategy to obtain observer status for Taiwan in the
International Criminal Police Organization. And the second bill
is House Resolution 235, Expressing the deepest condolences to,
and solidarity with, the people of Nepal following the recent
devastating earthquakes, and Salmon amendment 70 in the nature
of a substitute to H.R. 235. Without objection, these items
will be considered as read and will be considered en bloc.
[The information referred to follows:]
[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Mr. Salmon. I will now recognize members to speak on these
items, beginning with myself and the ranking member. Today, we
consider measures H.R. 1853 on ``Taiwan joining Interpol,'' and
H. Res. 235 on ``Condolences and support for relief efforts in
Nepal after their devastating earthquake.'' For 36 years, the
Taiwan Relations Act has helped promote peace and stability in
Asia, and facilitated a productive relationship between the
United States and Taiwan. In the spirit of the Taiwan Relations
Act, I, along with the chair and ranking members of both the
full Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Subcommittee on Asia
and the Pacific, Mr. Royce, Mr. Engel, and Mr. Sherman,
introduced important legislation that advocates the U.S.
Government's support of Taiwan's efforts to obtain observer
status in the International Criminal Police Organization, also
known as Interpol.
Interpol was designed to promote the widest possible mutual
assistance between all criminal police authorities. From 1964
until 1984, Taiwan enjoyed full membership in Interpol, but was
removed when the People's Republic of China applied for
membership. This bill will require the President to develop a
strategy to obtain observer status for Taiwan in Interpol.
Specifically, it requires an official request for observer
status for Taiwan, active urging of member states to assist in
the effort, as well as a status report to Congress.
Taiwan's observer status would promote stability and
security in the Asia-Pacific region and assist Taiwan in
protecting the safety of its citizens by combating criminal
activity through access to Interpol's global police
communications systems. Taiwan currently relies on the United
States and other countries' second-hand information, and it is
unable to share information on criminals to member countries,
generating inefficiencies in addressing criminal activity
throughout the region.
With the rise in terrorism across the globe, not allowing
Taiwan independent and easy access to Interpol is an
unnecessary and a very dangerous risk. It is with this
knowledge of the potential contributions Taiwan could provide
that I wholeheartedly support H.R. 1853, which closely reflects
Congress's support for Taiwan. I also want to thank Chairman
Royce, Ranking Member Engel for helping us move this bill
swiftly through the full committee process. And we look forward
to the full committee markup tomorrow on this bill.
Next, I would like to express my support for H. Res. 235,
which raises awareness on the ongoing efforts by our government
and other international actors to respond to the crisis in
Nepal. It further encourages rescue efforts to focus on
vulnerable populations, such as women and children. The
resolution has garnered over 110 bipartisan cosponsors. I have
an amendment in the nature of a substitute that updates numbers
on our aid efforts, that draws attention to the sacrifices of
our Marines, and that focuses on the specific threats to women
and children.
On April 25, 2015, Nepal was hit with a devastating 7.8
magnitude earthquake northwest of the capital, Katmandu. The
earthquake claimed the lives of over 8,000 people, with
thousands more reported injured, critical infrastructure
damaged, including roads, hospitals, and homes. The United
Nations estimated upwards of 8 million people were impacted by
this earthquake, with 1.4 million people in need of immediate
food assistance. After a quick response, led on the U.S. front
by USAID, with the Departments of State and Defense, search and
rescue operations had neared conclusion, the rise in casualties
began to slow, and international humanitarian relief began to
clear the road to recovery.
Then on May 12, Nepal was struck again, with a 7.3
magnitude earthquake near the capital, this time to the east.
This second earthquake claimed more lives and disrupted relief
efforts. It was after this second event that we learned of one
of our military helicopters going down in Nepal. We were
saddened to hear the subsequent confirmation that we lost all
six, all six Marines aboard and the two Nepali soldiers
traveling with them. It would be impossible for the
subcommittee to properly thank these fine men and women for
their great service. The sacrifice they made is far too great,
and words are far too inadequate. We take solace in the fact
that they served our Nation by doing something truly American,
helping pick up our friends when they have fallen. In fact,
Arizona, we lost one of our own, one of our brightest and best
in our efforts in delivering aid to Nepal, Lance Corporal Jacob
A. Hug. Coincidentally, he has the same name as my 34-year-old
son, and I spoke to his father yesterday for about 20 minutes
on the phone. It was a very heartfelt exchange. And I want you
to know that this family, they don't harbor any bitterness.
They are so very proud of their son. They are proud of the life
that he gave in the service of his fellow beings. And I am
proud of him too, and I am proud of all of them.
This resolution expresses Congress's deepest condolences
for all individuals affected by this tragic natural calamity.
Yet the resolution also recognizes how, in the midst of this
chaos, our government, especially USAID, the State Department,
and the Department of Defense have stepped up to provide
unparalleled support. And I couldn't be prouder of them.
We also commend the global NGO community for their ongoing
humanitarian response, and their selfless efforts and
sacrifices. It is going to be a long road to recovery for
Nepal, and it will be essential that the international
community, both governments and NGOs, work closely with the
Nepalese people to rebuild. I urge the committee's support for
these two measures, and I now recognize the ranking member for
his comments on today's measures.
Mr. Sherman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for this markup,
these two bills, and the subsequent hearing. The White House
has scheduled and invited me to a meeting on Iran. And if this
chair is absent for a while, it is not for any frivolous
decision. Both of these bills are important. As to the Taiwan
Interpol bill, I am pleased to be the chief Democrat on the
bill or lead Democratic sponsor, and whatever the proper title
would be. I strongly support the bill, of course. Taiwan
functions as an independent country, and needs to function as
an independent country inside international organizations. To
date, Taiwan has been admitted to only one international
organization, the World Health Organization, under the title
observer status. This fiction that Taiwan is part of China
complicates so many international affairs, but we cannot allow
it to prevent effective law enforcement against criminal gangs
and international criminal organizations.
As things stand now, Taiwan gets some information from the
International Police Organization, Interpol, but it is not
consistent, it is not reliable. Taiwan doesn't have real-time
access to Interpol's networks and systems. And this hurts not
only the people of Taiwan, but people all over the world that
are potentially the victims of criminals who cannot be
apprehended because we don't have an efficient sharing of
information and efficient multinational law enforcement. It is
for this reason I support the bill, which will direct the
President to develop a strategy to obtain observer status for
Taiwan in the International Criminal Police Organization, and I
look forward to this bill sailing through Congress, and
hopefully being executed robustly by the administration.
As to the people of Nepal, I represent Northridge. And we
know the calamity that an earthquake can cause. I am pleased to
be the Democratic lead sponsor on this piece of legislation. As
you pointed out, 8,000 and more have been killed, \1/2\ million
homes destroyed or badly damaged, 2 million people displaced.
This has been a terrible disaster, not only the first
earthquake, but the aftershocks, including the major aftershock
which the chairman briefed us about.
I look forward, between now and when we go to full
committee, to amending this resolution to first take note of
the Americans who have sought to provide assistance. We have
the two special task forces that were deployed to Nepal; one
from Fairfax, Virginia, the other from Los Angeles, California.
I know Gerry Connolly wants to make sure that this resolution
recognizes them. And, of course, you noted the Arizona hero
that lost his life trying to help the people of Nepal.
In addition, Mike Honda suggested to me that we, in the
resolving clauses in this resolution, focus on the importance
of preventing violence against women. And I look forward to
working with you on language to focus on that as well. I look
forward to the international community sustaining its effort to
help the people of Nepal. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for
working with me on both resolutions, and look forward to them
going through the full committee and the floor of the House.
And I am torn, but I do think I have to go to the White House
pretty soon.
Mr. Salmon. I thank the ranking member. And I know that it
is the lot of those of us that work in Foreign Affairs that
juggling multiple balls at the same time has become an art form
that we have to all master. And before I yield to any other
members that would like to make opening statements, one thing I
did want to say, especially in terms of our Marines that lost
their lives, one of the Scriptures that has given me a lot of
comfort through the course of my life, and one that I just
think is so poignant to this time is this: ``Greater love hath
no person than this that he would give his life for another.''
And I take great comfort in that. It is the greatest act that
any human being can do, and that is to give their life for
somebody else. And that is what these brave soldiers have done.
Any folks on the Republican side? Mr. Chabot, would you like to
open?
Mr. Chabot. Thank you. I will be brief, Mr. Chairman. I
want to express my support for both pieces of legislation under
consideration here this afternoon, H. Res. 235 and H.R. 1853,
as you indicated. I am a cosponsor of H. Res. 235 because it is
critical that we support the United States humanitarian
response efforts to the devastating earthquake that hit Nepal
last month. Our relationship with Nepal is strategically
important, among other things, because of its key location
between India and China, of course. But on a humanitarian
level, we certainly need to reach out. As you indicated, our
men and women in uniform and otherwise are doing that. And
some, unfortunately, have made the ultimate sacrifice. In the
days and weeks and months ahead, the challenges and needs will
only grow more serious for the people of Nepal. It is important
that they know we stand by their side.
I am also a cosponsor of H.R. 1853, and support efforts to
help Taiwan gain observer status in the International Criminal
Police Organization. I happen to be, along with my colleague to
my left, Mr. Rohrabacher, two of the lead original founding
Members of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus, along with Sherrod
Brown and Robert Wexler, when he was a Member.
Mr. Rohrabacher. Are we the only ones left?
Mr. Chabot. We are. At least in this august body. And at
the end of the day, allowing Taiwan to participate in Interpol
is beneficial for all of us. As the world has become more
interconnected, the sharing of information has increased
exponentially, which, in general, is a good thing. But it has
also resulted in the expansion of terrorist networks and
criminal activities on the Internet as well.
For that reason, allowing Taiwan to have observer status in
this organization will foster greater security, safety, and
peace across the region and around the globe by giving it real-
time information on criminal and global criminal activities
that happen to cross Taiwan's borders. Readily having this
access will allow Taiwan to serve as a responsible member of
the international community.
As we have seen with Taiwan's participation in the World
Health Assembly and International Civil Aviation Organization,
Taiwan's participation in this institution is no different. It
will only continue to promote global safety and security that
benefits everyone. I also agree--I would like to say I agree
with what Mr. Sherman said before because I don't say that all
the time, but I definitely agree when he said that this idea
that Taiwan is really not a country is just fiction. It is a
country, and ultimately, I believe will be independent from
China. It is probably not going to happen next week or next
month or next year, but this fiction that it is a separate
country is something that at some point needs to be put to
rest.
I say that as a former founding member of the Taiwan Caucus
and a present member of the Taiwan Caucus. I see my colleague
from Virginia kind of cringed there because he knows we are
probably stepping on some toes in Beijing, but to hell with
Beijing. I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. Salmon. Any other member seek recognition to speak on
these items?
Mr. Connolly. Mr. Chairman?
Mr. Salmon. Yes.
Mr. Connolly. I always have respect for my friend from Ohio
and his insights, but I would say as cochairman of the Taiwan
Caucus, I think we need to work to enhance both Taiwan's
defense and to support Taiwan in the path it has chosen as a
democracy. My first visit to Taiwan, Taiwan frankly was not a
democracy, and it has come a long, long way. And there are
cultural ties that both unite and separate the mainland and
Taiwan. And I would just caution, however, that there are
things that can provoke and that make the task of
reconciliation and support for Taiwan's unique path more
difficult. And that would be the only reason I cringed a little
bit, and my friend saw it, because words we say here are
magnified in the Taiwan Straits. And we obviously want to be
supportive, and not unwittingly do anything that could be, as I
said, provocative. Thank you.
Mr. Salmon. Thank you. Any other member seek recognition on
either of these two measures? If not, we will get to business.
Hearing no other requests for recognition, the question occurs
on adopting the items under consideration en bloc. All those in
favor, say aye. Opposed, say no. In the opinion of the Vhair,
the ayes have it, and the en bloc items are approved.
Without objection, H.R. 1853 and H. Res. 235, as amended,
will be reported favorably to the full committee. And the staff
is directed to make any technical and conforming changes. I
would like to thank all of our members and staff for the
assistance and cooperation that went into today's markup. The
subcommittee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 2:30 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
