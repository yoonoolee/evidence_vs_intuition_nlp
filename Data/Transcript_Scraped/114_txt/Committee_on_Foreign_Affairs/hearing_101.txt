HONORING THE TUNISIAN PEOPLE FOR THEIR

DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION; AND EXPRESSING CONCERN

OVER ANTI-ISRAEL AND ANTI-SEMITIC INCITEMENT

WITHIN THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY

----------

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 2015

House of Representatives,

Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa,

Committee on Foreign Affairs,

Washington, DC.

The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 1:55 p.m., in
room 2172, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Ileana Ros-
Lehtinen (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Ms.  Ros-Lehtinen. The subcommittee will come to order. We
meet pursuant to notice to mark up two bipartisan resolutions.
As your offices were previously notified, it is the intent of
the Chair to consider the following items en bloc which members
have before them: House Resolution 277, honoring the Tunisian
people for their democratic transition; the Ros-Lehtinen
amendment in the nature of a substitute to House Resolution
277, which was provided to your offices yesterday; House
Resolution 293, expressing concern over anti-Israel and anti-
Semitic incitement within the Palestinian Authority; and a Ros-
Lehtinen amendment in the nature of a substitute to H. Res.
293, which was also provided to your offices yesterday. Without
objection, these items are considered as read, and will be
considered en bloc.
[The information referred to follows:]
H. Res.
277 deg.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Ms.  Ros-Lehtinen. After the ranking member and I speak on
these measures, I will be glad to recognize any other members
seeking recognition. Without objection, all members may have 5
days to submit statements for the record on today's business.
Nearly 5 years ago, the Tunisian people sparked a wave
across the Middle East and North Africa called the Arab Spring,
that the world hoped would be the catalyst to end authoritarian
rule in the region and usher in a new era of democracy. Today,
the people of Tunisia are firmly going down the path toward
democracy, as we have seen them reach multiple milestones. We
know that elections alone do not make a democracy, and that
establishing a new democracy is a long road. But today, I am
even more optimistic for Tunisia's democratic prospects.
The people of Tunisia have adopted a new Constitution, one
that makes place for religious and ethnic minorities and women
to be equal and to help build the new Tunisia. For the first
time ever, the Tunisian people democratically elected a new
legislature and a President. Now, the Tunisian Government is
moving to consolidate its gains and build on its democratic
institutions, ensure the respect for human rights and the rule
of law, and implement additional democratic reforms. Of course,
there are still so many hurdles to overcome, but it is our hope
that with the continued assistance of the United States, we can
assure that Tunisia remains on course and becomes the region's
first full-fledged democracy and a shining example for the rest
of the region to emulate.
That is why I am pleased to support this resolution
honoring the people of Tunisia for their continued success on
their democratic transition. And I urge all of my colleagues to
do the same, and send a message to the people of Tunisia that
we appreciate and support their efforts. I would also urge my
colleagues to support a resolution I have introduced alongside
my good friend and ranking member, Mr. Ted Deutch of Florida,
expressing concern over the anti-Israel and anti-Semitic
sentiment within the Palestinian Authority with all that is
going on now with the clashes in Jerusalem at the Temple Mount
between Palestinians throwing rocks at Jews and Israeli
security forces while tensions are, as we know, on the rise.
And one of the major reasons why these tensions are on the
rise is because rather than being a responsible partner for
stability and peace, Abu Mazen and the Palestinian Authority
have stoked the anger with government-sponsored incitement. For
years, the Palestinian Authority has served to exacerbate the
problem through indoctrination in schools, including anti-
Semitic language in textbooks and lesson plans, or by paying
salaries to the families of terrorists and naming public
schools and public squares after these terrorists.
We always hear that actions speak louder than words, but
the actions and the words from the PA and Abu Mazen both
indicate that there is no interest in the current government
for peace with Israel. We must do more to hold the PA
accountable for its anti-Israel incitement. We must do more to
encourage the PA to discontinue its incitement to violence
against Israel. And we must work to do more to support and
encourage those individuals and organizations working to
promote cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians. There
will never be peace until and unless there is some trust and
respect. But it can't happen until the Palestinian leadership
no longer moves to incite hatred and violence against Israel.
And now I am pleased to yield to the ranking member, Mr.
Deutch, for his remarks.
Mr.  Deutch. Thank you, Madam Chairman. I will be brief in
my comments as I have got to run back and forth to another
committee hearing. I want to thank the chairman for working
together to ensure bipartisan support for these two
resolutions. Chairman Ros-Lehtinen and I introduced House
Resolution 293 to highlight the ongoing incitement by officials
within the Palestinian Authority in official textbooks and on
state television. President Abbas came to power on a platform
of nonviolence. He speaks of his desire for peace. But using
inflammatory language and failing to speak out against anti-
Semitism and incitement simply gives the appearance of
condoning it. Violence cannot be condoned. And those truly
seeking peace must speak out. Indeed, when there is violence
against innocent Palestinians we must speak out. And I am
pleased to see Prime Minister Netanyahu doing so.
We know that peace will only come from an agreement between
the Israelis and the Palestinians themselves. But conditions on
the ground will dictate whether the Palestinian people are
prepared for what a Palestinian State living side by side with
the Jewish State of Israel ultimately looks like. Textbooks and
maps must show Israel's existence. Town squares should never be
named after suicide bombers or attackers that glorify terrorism
against innocent civilians. This resolution also applauds those
Israeli and Palestinian organizations that are working together
to promote peace between the two peoples, whether it is through
the provision of medical services, or peer-to-peer interaction,
or a Palestinian professor who dares to teach his students of
the horrors of the Holocaust. I hope my colleagues will join us
in supporting this resolution.
Second, I urge members to support House Resolution 277,
which recognizes the democratic transition in Tunisia and the
importance of the U.S.-Tunisia relationship. It was the self-
immolation of a Tunisian fruit vendor that gave way to the Arab
Spring. And since 2011, Tunisia has fought to ensure its
transition to democracy would be peaceful. And thus far, it has
been a model for other nations still struggling for democratic
ideals.
Tunisia has successfully completed its first free
Presidential elections and transition to a new government. The
new Constitution includes unprecedented rights for women and
minorities and respect for rule of law. Yet Tunisia faces a
precarious security threat. Tunisians have gone to train with
ISIS in staggering numbers. Its border with Libya is difficult
to control. And Libya's lawlessness has made it a magnet for
terror training and transit.
In a span of mere months, Tunisia suffered a horrific
terror attack at the Bardo Museum and another at the popular
tourist destination of Sousse. The United States is committed
to assisting Tunisia with stabilizing its security, its
economy, and its democracy. This resolution is a reminder of
the importance of a successful and thriving Tunisia. I urge my
colleagues to support it.
Ms.  Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you so very much, Mr. Deutch. I
would like to recognize other members for any opening
statements they would like to make. Mr. Chabot of Ohio is
recognized.
Mr.  Chabot. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I want to
commend you for bringing this legislation before the
subcommittee today. As we know, Israel is one of the United
States' closest allies. And over the years, it has withstood
anti-Semitic rhetoric from far too many of its neighbors, often
propagated by state institutions and government officials from
neighboring states. And unfortunately, one of the offenders is
right next door, the Palestinian Authority. A monthly
educational magazine for children, one that is sponsored by the
Palestinian National Committee for Education, depicts Hitler as
a role model. This does nothing for the promotion of peace in
the region. To the contrary, it encourages hate and violence,
when acceptance of differences and loving your neighbors should
be the key principles of a young person's education.
And this perpetuated hatred by the Palestinian Authority
and their allies has a direct impact within Israel's own
borders. Just this week, a Jewish man was killed by Palestinian
stone throwers after the Secretary General of the Palestinian
Liberation Organization accused Israel of turning Jerusalem
into an exclusively Jewish city. Tell me how is this rhetoric
productive in finding a middle ground?
Israel and the Palestinian Authority will never be able to
negotiate peace if one party is constantly under attack by one
that institutionally encourages anti-Israeli and anti-Semitic
beliefs. If we ever hope to see cooperation in the region, we
will have to see a change in attitudes first. This measure
recognizes those realities and reasserts our support for an
Israel that is treated with the dignity and respect that it
deserves. It is a timely measure. I urge my colleagues to
support H. Res. 293. And I yield back, Madam Chair.
Ms.  Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you very much, Mr. Chabot. Mr.
Cicilline.
Mr.  Cicilline. Thank you, Chairwoman Ros-Lehtinen and
Ranking Member Deutch, for bringing up these two bills for
markup today. I am proud to be a cosponsor of both. I would
like to just say a few words about House Res. 293, which
condemns anti-Semitic sentiment within the Palestinian
Authority. Both the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli
Government have agreed on numerous accords to refrain ``from
incitement, including hostile propaganda.'' But it is
incredibly concerning that the PA has not eradicated such anti-
Semitic and anti-Israel language from their public statements,
official materials, and their educational system.
As the Middle East faces incredible turmoil and chaos, the
perpetuation of anti-Semitism by the Palestinian Authority is
more dangerous than ever. Both the Palestinian Authority and
Israel are threatened by the current regional destabilization,
and fueling the fire with anti-Semitism is outrageous and
extremely risky for Jews, for Israel, and ultimately for the
entire region.
This all happening in the context of dangerously increasing
anti-Semitism throughout Europe. To be sure, there are
organizations with individuals on both sides working to foster
cooperation, mutual understanding, and cultural exchanges
between Israelis and Palestinians. And there are Palestinians
who reject the hateful and racist language being used by the
Palestinian Authority and its supporters. I hope that the
United States will continue to support those that are working
to bring peace and understanding to the region, and will
continue to condemn the Palestinian Authority's actions and
statements meant to incite hatred against Jews and against the
State of Israel. And I thank you, Madam Chair, and yield back.
Ms.  Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you, Mr. Cicilline. Seeing no
other requests for time, are there any amendments? The Chair
moves to report the en bloc items favorably to the full
committee. All those in favor say aye. All opposed, no. In the
opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it. The motion is approved,
and the measures, as amended, are reported favorably to the
full committee. With thanks to my colleagues for their input
and cooperation, that concludes today's markup, and the
subcommittee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 2:07 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
