WEDNESDAY, JULY 6, 2016

House of Representatives,

Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific,

Committee on Foreign Affairs,

Washington, DC.

The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:03 p.m., in
room 2172, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Matt Salmon
(chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Mr. Salmon. The subcommittee will come to order. We meet
today pursuant to notice to mark up four bipartisan measures.
As your offices have been notified, it is the intent of the
Chair to consider en bloc the following items, which were
previously provided to members and are in your folders: House
Resolution 210, Affirming and recognizing Khmer, Laotian,
Hmong, and Montagnard Freedom Fighters and the people of
Cambodia and Laos for their support and defense of the United
States Armed Forces and freedom in Southeast Asia; included in
that is Salmon amendment 148 in the nature of a substitute to
H. Res. 210; House Resolution 634, Recognizing the importance
of the United States-Republic of Korea-Japan trilateral
relationship to counter North Korean threats and nuclear
proliferation, and to ensure regional security and human
rights; Salmon amendment 146 in the nature of a substitute to
H. Res. 634; House Resolution 728, Supporting human rights,
democracy, and the rule of law in Cambodia; Sherman amendment
42 to H. Res. 728; and H.R. 4501, the Distribution and
Promotion of Rights and Knowledge Act of 2016.
Without objection, these items are considered as read and
will be considered en bloc.
[The information referred to follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Mr. Salmon. And I will now recognize members to speak on
these items, beginning with myself and the ranking member.
I would like to speak in support of each of the measures
our subcommittee will be marking up today. First, House
Resolution 210, legislation introduced by Mr. Duffy of
Wisconsin, recognizes the people of Cambodia and Laos for their
support of the United States Armed Forces in Southeast Asia.
Many ethnic groups in Cambodia and Laos fought with the United
States Armed Forces, aided in rescue efforts, assisted with
intelligence gathering, and provided food and shelter to our
troops during the Vietnam war era. These acts are truly
commendable. And this resolution seeks to recognize their
important contributions in our shared history. I worked with
Mr. Duffy in creating an amendment in the nature of a
substitute and submit that today to clarify some of the
language in the bill.
The next item is House Resolution 634, a bill I introduced
to recognize the strategic and security importance of the
United States-Republic of Korea-Japan trilateral relationship.
North Korea continues its provocations, test firing two
ballistic missiles just a couple of weeks ago. North Korea's
boldfaced rejection of international norms and multiple U.N.
resolutions is manifestly threatening the safety of the
neighborhood and our close allies Japan and Republic of Korea,
proving the administration's strategy of strategic patience is
not working. As a result, we must work proactively with our
allies to counter North Korean threats and nuclear ambitions.
The Korean-Japan relationship has come a long way. And our
three nations are now working closely together to confront the
threat of a nuclear North Korea. These closer ties will
ultimately foster increased security and ultimately improve the
lives of all those on the peninsula and in the region.
We can have no other expectation than that North Korea will
continue its provocations. And we must stand firm with our
allies and partner with them to deploy an antimissile system
that will protect their communities.
This resolution puts forth congressional intent to bolster
the trilateral relationship and offer support for regional
ballistic missile defense systems and provides viable stability
to the region.
Next, House Resolution 728, introduced by our Foreign
Affairs colleague Mr. Lowenthal, seeks to support human rights,
democracy, and the rule of law in Cambodia. I was proud to be
the lead cosponsor with him on this legislation to support
democracy and human rights in Cambodia. I am deeply concerned
by the ongoing harassment of opposition politicians and growing
restrictions on civil society and the press. The opposition
leader remains in exile under the threat of arrest. And his
deputy faces ostensibly politically motivated charges as well.
There is much that must be done in Cambodia to ensure fair and
free elections next year. This legislation will help facilitate
the necessary changes.
Our last item is H.R. 4501, the Distribution and Promotion
of Rights and Knowledge Act of 2016, which I was pleased to
introduce in partnership with Ranking Member Sherman. When
looking at the mess that is North Korea, we largely have two
means to improve security in the region, and the lives of those
within the hermit kingdom. First, under Chairman Royce's
leadership, Congress has already imposed new sanctions to
squeeze off funding mechanisms in an effort to reduce the means
to proliferate nuclear weapons. Second, we need to provide
information to the people of North Korea to empower them from
the inside, to reduce Kim Jong-un's influence and power.
North Korean leadership maintains a stranglehold on
information. It not only provides propaganda to preserve its
power. In 2008, under the North Korean Human Rights Act,
Congress authorized radio information flow into North Korea to
educate and free the minds of the people. Technology and times
have changed, and the programs we fund are in need of upgrades
as well. This bill will improve content and listenership to
empower the people of North Korea with information about the
outside world and basic human rights by allowing distribution
of devices as well as content within North Korea. These much-
needed updates to the program will go a long way to undermine
the regime's oppressive governance in North Korea.
All these bills are solid bipartisan measures, and I urge
my colleagues to support them as introduced or corrected by way
of amendment in the nature of a substitute.
And I would like to recognize Mr. Sherman for any comments
that he might have.
Mr. Sherman. Thank you. I want to thank the chairman for
holding this markup. I support each of the four bills we are
considering.
H. Res. 210, affirming and recognizing the Khmer, Laotian,
Hmong, and Montagnard Freedom Fighters and the people of
Cambodia and Laos for their support and defense of the United
States Armed Forces and freedom in Southeast Asia. It is
entirely appropriate that we recognize these brave allies who
fought alongside us.
Supporting human rights, democracy, and the rule of law in
Cambodia, H. Res. 728. I want to thank my colleague from
southern California, Mr. Lowenthal, for his leadership on this
resolution and his general leadership on human rights in
Southeast Asia. I met just last week with opposition leader Sam
Rainsy, who is in exile because the government of Hun Sen has
abused the criminal defamation law to try to silence him. You
can't have a democracy when you have a criminal defamation law,
probably of any kind, but certainly a criminal defamation law
that is used to silence and criminalize political speech. That
is why I offered my amendment that would call specifically on
Cambodia to reform its defamation law and hopefully not apply
it to any political speech and not provide criminal penalties
for so-called defamatory statements. And we want to make it
explicit that Congress takes these issues extremely seriously.
We all buy garments. Some of them are made in Cambodia.
Cambodian garment manufacturers and U.S. importers have got to
understand that the American people want to see improvements in
human rights in Cambodia.
H. Res. 634, Recognizing the importance of the United
States-Republic of Korea-Japan trilateral relationship to
counter North Korean threats and nuclear proliferation, and to
ensure regional security and human rights. The North Korea
regime of Kim Jong-un is a great danger to international
security. The Kim regime continues to work toward developing
missiles and nuclear weapons. It is now trying to lengthen the
reach of those missiles with the sole purpose of reaching the
United States.
I am also concerned about North Korea perhaps selling
nuclear weapons to Iran or others. And, of course, Iran now has
many, many tens of billions of dollars that it did not have at
the beginning of last year.
The guiding principle of the United States' policies in
North Korea should be to exert every effort to pressure the
regime in order to incentivize change. So this resolution
encouraging cooperation with South Korea and Japan makes
senses. I fully support the resolution.
Moving on to H.R. 4501, Distribution and Promotion of
Rights and Knowledge Act of 2016. Pleased to join our chairman
in introducing this resolution. It calls for a more assertive
U.S. approach in trying to get independent information to the
people of North Korea using electronic media in various forms
as well as improving our broadcasting efforts. I want to thank
the chairman for moving this important bill.
Beyond economic sanctions, short of the use of military
force, one of the most effective things we can do is provide
the people of North Korea with information, which this
murderous regime seeks to deny them. This is one of the most
effective things the international community can do to pressure
the regime and hopefully move forward to a day when we can have
a government in North Korea that is at peace with the world and
at peace with its own people.
Information from independent sources has consistently been
a destabilizing influence on totalitarian regimes, which
accounts for why they go to such extreme ends to prevent that
information from reaching it citizens. The United States should
increase its efforts in this regard, increasing current VOA
broadcasting into North Korea and supplementing this
broadcasting with social media. We must adopt our diplomatic
efforts to spread the American message according to the new
technology of these times.
I am pleased to see the committee more forward in a
bipartisan fashion, which of course has characterized its work.
And I yield back 1 second of time.
Mr. Salmon. I thank the ranking member.
The Chair recognizes Mr. Rohrabacher.
Mr. Rohrabacher. I rise in support of all four of these
resolutions, but in particular, I would like to thank you, Mr.
Chairman, for your leadership and H. Res. 210, which
underscores the important role played by Khmer, Laotian, Hmong,
and Montagnards during the Vietnam war.
Now, while not in the actual military, I found myself in
the Central Highlands in Vietnam in 1967. And I was working
with a Montagnard tribesman, who I would--the people who you
could trust with your life were Montagnard tribesmen. And at
that time, there were some troubles with relying on our allies
in the South Vietnamese Army, but these tribal people, the
Montagnards--and by the way, ``Montagnards'' means mountain
people, and ``Hmong'' and ``Laotian'' mean mountain people. And
what we are really talking about is an ancient separation of
various peoples of that region between mountain people and
valley people. And the Montagnards were very unsophisticated
but most courageous. And they were short and small in stature,
but just overwhelming in courage and honor with their word. So
it is good that we are honoring them today because they saved a
lot of American lives. And I witnessed that firsthand.
And, number two, I would like to thank Mr. Lowenthal for
his H. Res. 728. Mr. Lowenthal has, as I did when I represented
his district, which he represents now, a large Cambodian
population of Cambodian-Americans, and the Cambodian-Americans
have come here to be free, but they look back at their
homeland, and after all these years when the Vietnam war is
behind us, Cambodia is still run by the same tough guy, a
corrupt regime that has been in power for over 30 years.
Let me just note, in a historical note, one reason why this
is an important resolution for us is that the United States
Government convinced Hun Sen, the tough guy who was put into
power by a Vietnamese military, they convinced him that he
should actually have a free and fair election. And he had it.
And there were 20,000 United Nations troops that were permitted
into Cambodia for that election. This must have been about the
middle 1990s. And Hun Sen lost that election. It was very--he
lost the election. And he was--but the American Ambassador at
the time felt that Hun Sen would not give up power and that if
we tried to force it, that he would--there would be bloodshed,
et cetera. And we backed down. And there was a compromise. They
would have two Prime Ministers and two Presidents. That bit of
a lack of willingness to stand up has condemned the people of
Cambodia all of these years to live under a tyrannical and
corrupt regime.
And this resolution should remind us that the people of
Cambodia are still suffering, and we should not leave them out
of the equation when we are trying to decide where we are going
to take a stand because it was our Ambassador who made the
wrong decision that has condemned them all of these years. So
what this resolution should be called is ``Mr. Hun Sen, it is
time to go.'' And as we pass this resolution, I hope that
message will be delivered to Hun Sen: It is time for you to go,
Hun Sen. It is time for the people of Cambodia to have their
freedom and to cast off this corrupt regime that steals their
property and enriches a small clique of Hun Sen cronies.
So, with that said, I will be supporting of the resolutions
but especially those two.
Mr. Salmon. I thank the gentleman.
The Chair recognizes Mr. Lowenthal.
Mr. Lowenthal. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And I would like to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for bringing
up my resolution, H. Res. 728, which supports human rights,
democracy, and the rule of law in Cambodia.
And I would also like to thank you, Mr. Chair, for
introducing this bill as the first sponsor, along with myself,
along with Chairman Royce as a cosponsor, and Ranking Member
Engel as a cosponsor. Congressman Chabot is also an original
cosponsor. Together, Congressman Chabot and myself founded the
Congressional Cambodia Caucus earlier this year to shine a
light on these issues.
As has been pointed out so well by Congressman Rohrabacher,
who I thank you for your comments, and also by the chair,
Cambodia is a nation with enormous potential, home to a large
youth population that strives to have their voices heard and
their concerns listened to. However, for over 30 years,
Cambodia has been ruled by the same ruling party and its
leader, Prime Minister Hun Sen. Despite political violence and
election irregularities, which were sanctioned by Hun Sen and
his Cambodian People's Party, the opposition has continued to
grow in support and will contest, first, local elections in
2017 and national elections in 2018. Last year, the Cambodian
Government revived the 7-year-old defamation charges against
opposition leader Sam Rainsy, expelling him from the
Parliament, forcing him into self-imposed exile. That is not
enough. Since then, the government has sought to arrest Kem
Sokha, the deputy to Sam Rainsy and the deputy opposition
leader, who now remains under house arrest, effective house
arrest.
This deteriorating political situation in Cambodia demands
action from the United States. That is why it is so important
that we pass this resolution and show that Congress stands with
the people of Cambodia and reaffirms our commitment to
democracy, human rights, and the rule of law in Cambodia.
Through this resolution, we call on the Government of Cambodia
to, one, cease all harassment and intimidation of the Cambodian
opposition; drop all politically motivated charges against
opposition law makers; allow them to return to Cambodia and
freely participate in the political process; and we ask the
Government of Cambodia to foster an environment where democracy
can thrive and flourish.
Lastly, I would like to thank Congressman Sherman for
working with us to offer his amendment strengthening the
resolution. This amendment adds a clause calling for reform of
criminal defamation laws of the sort which are now being used
to prosecute Cambodian opposition leaders, laws that are
fundamentally antidemocratic.
Again, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and
I thank you again, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back.
Mr. Salmon. Thank you.
Do any other members seek recognition to speak on any of
these items?
If not, then we will go ahead and proceed. Then we will be
voting on adopting the items under consideration en bloc.
All those in favor, say aye.
Opposed, say no.
In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it, and the en
bloc items are approved.
Without objection, H. Res. 210, H. Res. 634, H. Res. 728,
and H.R. 4501, as amended, will be reported favorably to the
full committee, and the staff is directed to make any technical
and conforming changes.
And I would like to thank all the members and staff for the
assistance and cooperation that went into today's markup.
And the subcommittee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 2:23 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
