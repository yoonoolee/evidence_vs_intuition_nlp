ERRATA

The referenced hearing held before the Subcommittee on
Human Resources, House Committee on Ways and Means and the
Subcommittee on Nutrition, House Committee on Agriculture was
inadvertently published with the wrong name for the House
Committee on Agriculture's subcommittee. On the cover of the
hearing it should read ``COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE/SUBCOMMITTEE
ON NUTRITION;'' and on page (1) under the title and date it
should read as Committee on Agriculture, Subcommittee on
Nutrition.
