NATIONAL ACADEMIES STUDY ON PEER REVIEW AND DESIGN COMPETITION IN THE
NNSA NATIONAL SECURITY LABORATORIES

House of Representatives,

Committee on Armed SerWashington, DC, Tuesday, January 12, 2016.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 3:31 p.m., in room
2118, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Mike Rogers
(chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE ROGERS, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM ALABAMA,
CHAIRMAN, SUBCOMMITTEE ON STRATEGIC FORCES

Mr. Rogers. Good afternoon, the subcommittee will come to
order. I want to welcome our witnesses, who are co-chairs
of the National Academies of Science panel that conducted
a study on these issues. Today's hearing is on Peer Review
and Design Competition in the NNSA [National Nuclear
Security Administration] National Security Laboratories.
This committee launched this study a few years ago because it
wanted an objective, nonpartisan review of these two
foundational aspects of our nuclear deterrent. Quoting
from the committee report in 2013, quote: ``The committee
believes that peer review and design competitions are
critical components of nuclear stockpile stewardship.
Because of their importance, the committee believes that
an independent assessment is needed to understand the
effectiveness of current practices,'' closed quote.
It is clear that without effective peer review and design
competition within our nuclear weapons labs, the long-term
health and viability of our deterrent is in danger. So we
asked the National Academies to review these two issues
and give us their assessment. And at the risk of stealing
their thunder, our witnesses are reporting that while,
quote, ``The state of peer review at the weapons labs is
healthy and robust, the state of design competition is
not. The NNSA complex must engage in robust design
competitions in order to exercise the design and
production skills that underpin stockpile stewardship and
are necessary to meet evolving threats,'' close quote.
So the report card is mixed, and we need to understand why.
More importantly, we need to hear the witnesses'
recommendations on what we and the administration should
be doing about it. Because at its core, the credibility of
our nuclear deterrent rests on the ability of our
scientists and engineers to design, build, and field
weapons in a timely way. The witnesses state that the
nuclear enterprise needs to exercise, on a regular ongoing
basis, the full suite of nuclear weapons design,
development, engineering, and production capabilities
needed to respond to the evolving threats.
This committee has recently taken steps in this direction by
creating the Stockpile Responsiveness Program, and the
Foreign Nuclear Weapons Prototyping Program. I will be
curious to hear what the witnesses think of these efforts
and what more should be done.
Coupled with our Project Atom hearing in November, today's
hearing should focus our efforts on preparing for the
dynamic and highly uncertain nuclear future. We must
ensure our nuclear enterprise is ready to meet the future.
With the guidance of our witnesses, I am confident we can
do just that. Thank you for testifying today and leading
the study. We know it takes time to do these things, and
we very much appreciate this time and effort.
Our witnesses today are Paul Peercy, co-chair, National
Academies Study Committee that conducted this study and
Dean Emeritus of the College of Engineering at the
University of Wisconsin, Madison; and Dr. Jill Dahlburg,
co-chair of the National Academies Study Committee. In her
day job, Dr. Dahlburg is with the Naval Research Lab,
although she is not here in that capacity today.
With that, let me turn to the ranking member, my friend and
colleague from Tennessee, for any statement he would like
to make.

Appendix on page 19.]

STATEMENT OF HON. JIM COOPER, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM TENNESSEE, RANKING
MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON STRATEGIC FORCES

Mr. Cooper. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all,
congratulations on the victory last night. I stayed up
until midnight to see that. It was an amazing, amazing
game. Second, I would like to ask unanimous consent to
insert my opening statement for the record, as well as the
testimony of Dr. Garwin and Dr. Schwitters. Unfortunately,
they were not able to be here today, but----
Mr. Rogers. Without objection.
[The information referred to can be found in the Appendix
beginning on page 37.]
Mr. Cooper. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I look forward
to the testimony of the witnesses. These are extremely
important questions, and I hope that we can receive the
wisdom of the panelists today and do the right thing for
the country. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Cooper can be found in the
Appendix on page 21.]
Mr. Rogers. I thank the gentleman and the witnesses' joint
statement will be entered, without objection, into the
record.
Mr. Rogers. I would also like to enter into the record the
full report of the National Academy Study Committee.
Without objection, that will be submitted as well.

The Summary from the report is included in the Appendix. The full report
can be found at http://www.nap.edu/read/21806/chapter/1.
[The information referred to can be found in the Appendix on
page 45.]
Mr. Rogers. We have copies of the report for each of the
members and have a few available for others as well.
We will now ask our witnesses to make 5-minute opening
statements summarizing their statement. Dr. Peercy, we
will start with you. You are recognized for 5 minutes.

STATEMENT OF DR. PAUL S. PEERCY, CO-CHAIR, COMMITTEE ON PEER REVIEW AND
DESIGN COMPETITION RELATED TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS, NATIONAL ACADEMIES OF
SCIENCES

Dr. Peercy. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Mr. Chairman,
Ranking Member Cooper, and members of the subcommittee,
thank you for the opportunity to discuss the results of
our National Academies report, Peer Review and Design
Competition in the NNSA National Security Laboratories. My
co-chair, Dr. Jill Dahlburg, and I have prepared this
joint statement, and I want to ask Jill to please chime in
at any time during my comments.
Our report was released on October 15, and it is a product of
a very strong committee whose members have extensive
experience and excellent credentials in this area. The
statement of the task given to the National Academies for
the study was specified as noted in the fiscal year 2013
National Defense Authorization Act [NDAA]. It charged our
committee with assessing the quality and effectiveness of
design competition. The charge specified particular
dimensions of these assessments, which were carefully
addressed in our study and report. The study was supported
by the National Nuclear Security Administration which went
out of its way to provide the committee with full
information relevant to these tasks.
Let me begin with the bottom line, which Chairman Rogers has
already noted. The state of peer review at the DOE
[Department of Energy] weapons lab is healthy and robust,
but the state of design competition is not.
The NNSA complex must engage in robust design competition to
exercise design and production skills that underpin the
stockpile stewardship, and are necessary to meet evolving
threats.
Recent competitive design studies, such as the reliable
replacement warhead, RRW, were useful design and modeling
exercises, but were not true design competitions because
they did not result in the creation of an engineering
prototype, and the latter step is necessary to provide
essential feedback on the viability and practicality of a
design.
Therefore, the committee recommended that to exercise a full
set of design skills necessary for an effective nuclear
deterrent, the NNSA should develop and conduct the first
of what the committee envisions as a series of design
competitions that integrate the full, end-to-end process
from novel design conception, through engineering,
building, and non-nuclear testing of a prototype.
The process should exercise a full range of skills in the
complex needed to produce a new weapon, but this should be
done with the clear understanding that this prototype
would be a nuclear device, not a warhead, and that the
prototype would not enter the stockpile.
Maintaining nuclear weapon design skills through design
competitions is necessary for our nuclear deterrent
workforce to be fully capable of designing and building
weapons to meet evolving threats, understanding the status
and direction of foreign nuclear weapons programs, and
determining the best and most cost-effective approaches to
resolving problems that arise during stockpile weapon
surveillance and life extension programs.
It is important to emphasize that the scientists and engineers
who designed and built the weapons currently in the
stockpile have either retired, or soon will retire and
these design-and-build competitions are essential for
training the next generations of weapons designers for
transferring the knowledge from the current generations to
future generations, and for maintaining production skills
within the NNSA complex.
The committee made other recommendations. I would like to
bring three of these to your attention. The first, design
competition between independent teams that use different
approaches and methods are extremely valuable, especially
in a system as complex as a nuclear weapon where we do not
have comprehensive understanding of the physics. We also
gain increased confidence in the safety and reliability of
weapons in the stockpiles when they are assessed by
independent teams using different approaches and methods.
These observations led the committee to recommend that Los
Alamos and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories
continue to maintain independent design capabilities using
different approaches and methods to enable independent
peer review of critical technical issues. Sandia National
Lab should, likewise, carry out, for high priority issues,
competitive designs with independent teams that use
different approaches followed by peer review of component
subsystems and the full system.
Next, while noting that the peer review process is basically
healthy, the committee recommended two minor changes to
strengthen the peer review process.
And finally, the committee recommended steps to be followed in
future design competitions to avoid the detrimental
aspects of the RRW competition.
So, thank you again for the opportunity to testify today. And
we remain at your disposal for questions.
[The joint prepared statement of Dr. Peercy and Dr. Dahlburg
can be found in the Appendix on page 22.]
Mr. Rogers. And I thank you. Dr. Dahlburg, did you want to
summarize your opening statement?
Dr. Dahlburg. I would like to. Thank you very much.
Mr. Rogers. You have an extra 5 minutes.

STATEMENT OF DR. JILL P. DAHLBURG, CO-CHAIR, COMMITTEE ON PEER REVIEW AND
DESIGN COMPETITION RELATED TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS, NATIONAL ACADEMIES OF
SCIENCES

Dr. Dahlburg. Okay. So I would like to hark back to what Paul
said, which is, it is important to emphasize the
scientists and engineers who designed and built the
weapons currently in the stockpile have either retired or
soon will retire. And what we need to do is make sure that
we have a cadre of people who are going to be able to
maintain the stockpile into the indefinite future. I think
we all agree, as long as we have nuclear weapons, we must
be confident in these weapons.
The analogy I often think of is, like, actually cooking. If
you want to make something in the kitchen and you are
trying to train someone else to make what you are already
cooking, you can write down a recipe and they can follow
it. If they have never cooked before, the odds are that
they are not really going to know how to do it. You can
make a video, and they can look at it and then try it from
that. But the odds are, they are not going to have quite
the same expertise as if they actually come in the kitchen
with you, and they learn how to do what you mean by a
pinch of salt, or by stirring the flour with the butter.
And when you train that way, then you have a group of
people who are going to be able to do what is necessary at
each stage of replacement warheads, at each stage of
designs in the future.
And I want to emphasize that what we are talking about are
prototype devices. The design and fabrication should
exercise the full range of skills needed to produce a new
weapon. Doesn't mean produce one, it just means you have
to make sure that these people know every aspect of what
they are doing. The design should be able to be certified
in a manner consistent with the testing moratorium. This
is absolutely mandatory. The prototype nuclear explosive
package should be fully integrated with all of the Sandia
components. So it is not just the piece that the Livermore
and Los Alamos might work on, but across all of the three
laboratories.
If they require new Sandia electronic components, the
prototypes of these components should also be designed and
produced in parallel. And it should be a device, not a
warhead. That is, stockpile-to-target type scenarios
should be considered by assimilation or testing, but there
should be no expectation of actually getting something
that looks like it is going into the stockpile.
And this is, I believe, necessary in order to train that next
generation workforce, which is every bit as important for
a deterrent as the hardware that they are maintaining.
That is my statement.
[The joint prepared statement of Dr. Dahlburg and Dr. Peercy
can be found in the Appendix on page 22.]
Mr. Rogers. Great, I appreciate the opening statements. We
will now open to questions, and I recognize myself for the
first set of questions. Dr. Peercy and Dr. Dahlburg, let's
start with the good news you bring to us. Your team found
that the peer review was strong, healthy within the NNSA
labs. So tell us why.
Dr. Peercy. I think it is there because it was built in from
the early culture of excellence and a fear of failing,
because they did not understand the materials they were
using. So they really wanted, they wanted their designs
peer reviewed by others before they put them into test.
Mr. Rogers. How was that carried out, that peer review?
Dr. Peercy. So that peer review started out being carried out,
primarily, from other scientists in the same laboratory.
And then as time passed and especially after Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratories failed on its first three
tests, the peer review became laboratory-to-laboratory
much more. And in the case of Sandia National
Laboratories, a branch was built in Lawrence Livermore,
and they reviewed the Albuquerque designs, and the
Albuquerque team reviewed the Lawrence Livermore designs.
The cultures of those two branches were very different. The
culture of the Sandia Lab in Livermore took on the culture
of Lawrence Livermore National Lab and the culture of the
Sandia Lab in Albuquerque took on the culture of the Los
Alamos National Labs. And so that gave purely independent
teams designing each other's work, and that is why we
recommended that that be maintained going forward,
especially for high-consequence items.
And we also recommended that the peer review be codified a bit
more. Sandia has written guidelines for what type of peer
review when, and we recommended that Los Alamos and
Lawrence Livermore create their own short, written
guidelines.
Dr. Dahlburg. Yes, and actually short is to the point. We
don't want this to turn into another process that becomes
a time sink. just something that they can explain. Because
right now, they do very informal peer review, peer-to-
peer, and it goes higher and higher until, finally, the
lab director is involved, and there should be something of
a checklist that says at the level of uncertainty, this is
the kind of peer review that we require.
Mr. Rogers. Good. How do the labs determine what level or
types of peer review is required for various programs or
projects and is the process formal, informal, ad hoc, or
structured?
Dr. Peercy. So the process has been a bit ad hoc at the
nuclear design laboratories, Los Alamos and Livermore.
Sandia is a much more formal process. And they continue to
formalize it. And Sandia also has--although it does not
have a complete--a competitor that does a complete end-to-
end design of the non-nuclear components for a given
weapon, if you look across American industry, every one of
those different parts are designed and sold. So those are
customers for Sandia, and they are also reviewers of
Sandia.
Mr. Rogers. Okay. Is the peer review process strong on the
non-nuclear side of the business given that there is only
one lab, Sandia, that is doing non-nuclear?
Dr. Peercy. Yeah, it is strong, and it was made strong partly
because the other--some other institutions, like the
Department of Defense, use the same products, some of the
same products; but, also, there are competitors in the
private sector. And they provide the same products, and so
there is competition, not on the complete spectrum from
one company, but if you take--if you integrate all of the
companies, you have the complete spectrum.
Mr. Rogers. Okay. Let's move over to the less than good news
side of the news you brought us. The report says your
team, quote, ``is deeply concerned about the state of the
design competition in all three laboratories,'' closed
quote. It goes on to say that, quote, ``Recent design
studies have been good analysis and modeling exercises,
but they did not result in the actual engineering and
fabrication of components and systems,'' closed quote.
Why is this distinction important, and why should the labs be
pursuing actual engineering and prototype fabrication with
a clear guidance that the weapon would not actually be
produced and deployed?
Dr. Peercy. I think the committee thinks that is important
because we do not have complete understanding of the
physics of the materials and the processes that go into
the weapon. So you look at--you do the best you can with
experiments, but you can't reach all of the experimental
region you need, and then you do models and simulation
based on that. But you find that the two different labs'
models give different answers. So the question is, which
one is right?
Mr. Rogers. Okay.
Dr. Peercy. And that is why you do this.
Dr. Dahlburg. And there are, in addition to the workforce, we
need to understand the status and direction of foreign
nuclear weapon programs, and we also need to determine the
best and most cost-effective approaches to resolving
problems that do arise during surveillance and the life
extension programs. So these three are the key reasons.
Mr. Rogers. Okay. The report notes that designing and
producing prototypes of new nuclear weapons designs will
help address evolving threats. Why does conducting
modeling or computer simulations not get the job done
here, and why do we need to go all the way to full designs
and the building of prototypes? Your microphone.
Dr. Peercy. Sorry. It was very clear for the nuclear
components why you need to do the prototyping and testing.
And----
Mr. Rogers. Go ahead and explain why.
Dr. Peercy. Pardon?
Mr. Rogers. Go ahead and explain. You said it is obvious.
Dr. Peercy. Oh, okay, because you don't know if the design is
going to work. Right off the bat, you don't know first, if
it is a viable design that can be built. A lot of the
early designs could not be built.
Dr. Dahlburg. And there is more than that. When you are doing
a simulation, you are modeling the real world, and there
are aspects in that simulation that you made assumptions,
in many ways. The numerics themselves are assumptions, and
the physics packages are also assumptions. So as you go
into more and more extreme states of matter, in large
cases, you are guessing because you can't have measured
every point that you are simulating. Therefore, you have
to do some form of validation with physics. And that is
why you need to do actual experimentation.
Mr. Rogers. Okay. Last thing I want to ask is, why does the
report stress that a, quote, ``clean slate,'' closed
quote, design competition--why is that important?
Dr. Peercy. So the committee thinks that is important because
you want to stimulate the nuclear engineering package
designers to think about how to design a new weapon, and
you want to stimulate the Sandia National Labs, who have a
lot of work doing life extension programs to actually
think about how they would build the supporting
electronics and systems for a different nuclear package.
So right now, the life extension programs only look at
existing nuclear packages. And that exercises part of
Sandia's expertise, but not all that is needed, and, of
course, no new nuclear packages are being designed. So Los
Alamos and Lawrence Livermore need that exercise.
Mr. Rogers. If that clean-slate competition were pursued, does
the administration 3+2 nuclear stockpile strategy exercise
the full range of skills and design competition your study
recommends?
Dr. Peercy. We didn't hear much about the 3+2, but from what
we heard about the 3+2, it does not exercise the full
range. Because the 3+2 basically takes existing nuclear
packages, or, at least, the footprint of those, and works
around those.
Mr. Rogers. Okay. With that, I yield to the ranking member for
any questions he may have.
Mr. Cooper. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to explore
first the degree of unanimity behind the report; first, of
your committee members.
Dr. Peercy. So all of the committee members agree with that
report.
Mr. Cooper. So no dissenting views? No----
Dr. Peercy. There was no minority views.
Mr. Cooper. How about among the reviewers?
Dr. Peercy. Pardon?
Mr. Cooper. How about among the reviewers?
Dr. Peercy. Well, the reviewers had a lot of suggested
improvements, which we appreciate. But the reviewers, some
of the reviewers did not fully support the conclusions of
the report. I think that's a fair statement.
Dr. Dahlburg. Yes. But in the end, I think we accommodated all
of the reviewer comments in the document that you are
holding.
Mr. Cooper. Are we allowed to see the reviewer comments?
Mr. Weidman. No, they are held quiet within the Academy, by
the Academy's guidelines.
Mr. Cooper. So is it fair to say that this is supported by the
National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine?
Dr. Dahlburg. Yes. Absolutely.
Mr. Cooper. So how would you characterize the opinions of
scientists who disagree with you, who are members of the
Academy?
Dr. Peercy. I don't know. I am--I suspect there are
disagreeing opinions. In fact, I know there are two that I
just saw this morning that I think you entered into the
record. And I think there is a difference of opinion as to
whether or not we actually have enough knowledge to design
a new weapon if an adversary designs a new weapon and we
need to move into a new space that we have not been in
without a skilled workforce. And I think there is a big
difference of opinion over that. You want to add to that?
Dr. Dahlburg. Yeah, so that is why I started with my analogy
about cooking. It is something that we all know. And my
reason for being on this committee was that I truly feel
that that workforce is an essential pillar of our nuclear
deterrent.
So from the perspective of what we wrote, we wrote this in
order to make sure that that workforce was going to
continue into the next 30 to 50 years.
Mr. Cooper. I think you are touching on the core issue here,
which is really a personnel issue.
Dr. Dahlburg. Uh-huh.
Mr. Cooper. Especially the sensitive subject of quality of
personnel. Some people who are brilliant refuse to work on
nuclear weapons at all, in any form.
Dr. Peercy. That is right.
Mr. Cooper. So we don't have that talent pool. So we have to
make do with those who are willing to do this work, this
necessary work. So how do we cope with this? You use a
cooking analogy. That is important, and I don't want to
cut you off, Dr. Peercy. Go ahead if you would like.
Dr. Peercy. I was just going to say that the NNSA is
responsible for providing and maintaining the capabilities
necessary to sustain a safe, secure, and reliable nuclear
weapons stockpile for the Nation and its allies. And using
her analogy and other analogies, if you don't know how to
build a weapon because you've never built one, and there
is--and you can't even write down the recipes for it on
paper, how do you know you have got--you have maintained
the capabilities to sustain that nuclear weapon stockpile
for the Nation and its allies?
Mr. Cooper. Well, let's be very careful how we speak here,
because to say there are no recipes, I think would be
inaccurate. Dr. Dahlburg was saying, you know, there is
knowledge retention. It is a question of actually doing
it, the cooking process, the pinch of salt, the stirring
in the butter, whatever the analogy is. In medicine, in
residency training, each one, treat one, teach one. But
here, you are cutting it more finely, because you are
talking about a prototype, a nuclear device; not a
warhead. But what works is a warhead. So you are stopping
short. You want a real-world competition, but then you
don't want to actually build anything.
So this is a very tricky dividing line here. How do you make
it real without it being real? And one element that was
completely missing from the report is the State Department
aspect, because you are kind of assuming that other
nations won't see this as a threat or a problem when there
is no input from that sphere. A further question is, we do
a lot of forensic work on other things, and we learn a lot
from that. And that is not as a competition right there
using--that is more of an Olympics than what you are
talking about. You are talking about a national
competition, not an international Olympic competition. So
there are a lot of moving pieces here, but, fundamentally,
these are personnel issues. And personnel issues are very
difficult to address.
Dr. Dahlburg. And so, I guess we are both scientists, and
applied physicists, and so speaking from our personal
experience, if you don't actually compare your work with
experimentation, you can delude yourself very easily. Now,
I recognize NNSA has done a marvelous job categorizing the
large body of knowledge that exists. This is, indeed, the
case. It is the workforce, and it is our opinion that if
we want to maintain that for 30 years, we better have a
little bit more hands-on experience. And so----
Mr. Cooper. But you limit the degree of hands-on experience.
Dr. Dahlburg. Well, for two reasons. One is that we are
responding to an NNSA charge. So we spoke within the
sphere of the NNSA. So our goal was to make sure that the
NNSA complex is entirely addressed. Beyond that, the
report did not----
Mr. Cooper. But the goal is a safe, secure, and reliable
stockpile. It is not pleasing NNSA bureaucrats.
Dr. Dahlburg. Oh, heavens no. But it is--oh, no, no, no, no,
no, that is not what I meant. What I meant is, we were
addressing a charge. In a report of this nature, the
recommendations can only recommend back to NNSA. So we
can't go outside of that and recommend to the State
Department or to other agencies.
Mr. Cooper. Would the recommendations have been different if
you had been able to recommend to other agencies, if the
leash had been----
Dr. Peercy. We probably would have taken this further. There
was discussion among the committee about flight tests. And
we did not recommend flight tests for three reasons. One
reason was we wanted to keep it within the current budget.
We didn't want to see a big--a large expense that has to
be in place. Second reason is that we wanted to make sure
we didn't send the wrong signal as to why we were doing
this program, and flight--to an adversary, flight test
might do that. But the third reason is, flight tests are
in the purview of the Department of Defense [DOD], and not
the Department of Energy. And we were charged within the
NNSA purview.
Mr. Cooper. And you don't fear that subcritical testing would
have any of those negative implications?
Dr. Peercy. No, I don't fear the subcritical testing would
have those, as long as there are no nuclear emissions.
Mr. Cooper. But you put your own blinders on not wanting to
deal with State Department issues, or budget issues, or
DOD issues, or----
Dr. Dahlburg. Well, I think that is--we tried to stay true to
the charge. And so the charge itself was to actually
address the quality of the peer review, the incentives for
peer review. We are done with those. The alternate methods
for peer review, we addressed that, and then where design
competition is, what is the health and status and what is
going to happen to design competition. And so that was
what the report was about. If you would like to charge us
to do another report, the same committee would probably--
--
Dr. Peercy. Then broaden it. We would be happy to do that.
Mr. Cooper. The challenge in life is to get at the truth. No
one can ever achieve it completely. But we are trying to--
--
Dr. Dahlburg. Of course.
Mr. Cooper [continuing]. Model it. And it is very difficult--
--
Dr. Dahlburg. Of course.
Mr. Cooper [continuing]. Because there are a lot of moving
parts here. But I have overstayed my welcome. I will let
the chairman move on. I know Dr. Fleming is here.
Mr. Rogers. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from
Louisiana, Dr. Fleming, for 5 minutes.
Dr. Fleming. Thank you, and thank you to our panel team. Just
so I can understand some of the statements that you make
is kind of filled with jargon, and kind of vague
references. So I want to try to understand. What we have
is a stockpile of nuclear weapons, which, for the most
part, were built many years ago. The people who built
them, for the most part, probably have retired or died by
now. And what I think you are saying is, beyond other
things, you want to create a whole other generation of
people who are capable of keeping up the stockpile,
overhauling them when necessary, and maybe even some day
replacing them, if necessary.
We are already talking about the modernization of weapons. I
remember when I first came to Congress in 2009, getting a
lecture on the fact that we were still using what was
equivalent to television tube technology in some of our
nuclear weapons. Obviously, something--I mean, you
wouldn't--probably wouldn't find a television repairman
today, much less one who could actually fix a TV like
that.
So I get all of that. That makes a lot of sense. But when you
said that you have to test it to validate it, and it makes
a lot of sense, how far do you take that? Do you actually
do some type of near-nuclear reaction, or simulated
reaction, or how far do you get along the line to actually
validate the accuracy of your studies?
Dr. Peercy. So that is a very good question because you can do
a lot of tests on the components and the subsystems, and
then if you want to test the full system, you would take
out the warhead. You take out the nuclear package, and put
in a dummy package that behaves like the nuclear package
but does not have any radioactive material.
Dr. Fleming. Right.
Dr. Peercy. Okay. So that will test the full system.
Dr. Fleming. Right.
Dr. Peercy. And you hopefully can test without any nuclear
explosions, the nuclear package independently.
Dr. Fleming. So you understand that nuclear trigger and,
obviously, the response of plutonium, or whatever that you
have in there. So you go all the way up to that point with
the various interacting systems which you have to
modernize going forward.
Dr. Dahlburg. And also the complex itself. So I will use a
completely different build, so that I don't get in any
trouble. Say you are building a space flight instrument.
Okay? And so you have this instrument and you are going to
have to get it to technology ready--TRL [technology
readiness level] level 9, and it is going to go in a
satellite. In order to do that, you have to design it;
then you have to make sure that you can procure the parts.
You have to work with someone who might build a camera;
have to understand the electronics, and so on. And in
order to do all of this, you have to reach into different
places of the space flight hardware community.
Dr. Fleming. Uh-huh.
Dr. Dahlburg. Similarly, with the NNSA, there are many
different places that someone who is designing this
instrument is going to need to go. And if you don't go as
far as a design, you won't be testing that aspect. Do I
know the telephone numbers? Can I actually call somebody
at the plant and see if they can build this thing? So it
is that part of the testing that we are talking about.
Dr. Fleming. Yeah, so it sounds like to me that you wouldn't
even be coming close to violating any sort of test bans or
anything like that because you are not really using
directly nuclear material. You are using all of the
devices up to that point?
Dr. Peercy. That is correct.
Dr. Fleming. So that is important. So the National Nuclear
Security Administration's labs are not doing the weapons
designs needed for the eventuality to modernize nuclear
weapons arsenal. So my question is this: The report states
that your study group is deeply concerned about the state
of design competition at all three laboratories. Would you
please elaborate on this concern? What specifically
concerns you about this? I know you have touched on it
some, but maybe you can encapsulate that.
Dr. Peercy. So, I think the concern about the design
competition was that we have not really had a design
competition for the full weapon since 1992. Right. There
have been some modeling and simulations, but that doesn't
tell you if they are going to work. And then when you look
at the non-nuclear parts of the weapon, and Jill touched
on this, look at how fast the electronics changes, how
fast communication changes. I mean, you are not going to
be able to buy the components in those weapons that are in
there today. You are going to have to design whole new
ones. You may not find an industry out there that is
building those. Then you have got to build them in-house.
And you have got to know what you need, and you have got
to have the experts to do it.
Dr. Fleming. Okay. And so the advantage of prototyping is you
may know all of the systems work perfectly, but you don't
know if they all work perfectly together. Would that be a
fair----
Dr. Peercy. That is correct.
Dr. Fleming. Okay. Okay. Well, I think that answers my
questions. Thank you.
Mr. Rogers. I thank the gentleman. We have just been called
for votes. But I wanted to just close with one question
first, before I recognize the ranking member for any
closing questions.
How did your recommendation for design competition align with
the programs this committee has created through
legislation in recent years? Specifically, with the
Stockpile Responsiveness Program created by section 3112
of the fiscal year 2016 NDAA?
Dr. Peercy. I think it is very well-aligned. I think the two
are quite well-aligned. I think your legislation goes
further. It goes with the flight tests, but other than
that, they are the same.
Mr. Rogers. Would you recommend any modifications to our
legislation?
Dr. Peercy. I don't have any. No, I think it is very good.
Mr. Rogers. Great. All right. Does the ranking member have any
more questions?
Mr. Cooper. Do the heads of Los Alamos or Sandia or Lawrence
Livermore have the authority today, when they evaluate
personnel, to test them and see how good they are at
solving problems, including design problems?
Dr. Peercy. I would assume so. Yeah.
Mr. Cooper. So are we really talking about anything new here,
except an extramural way of formally having a process of
competition, because in competition, some people win, some
people lose.
Dr. Peercy. I think the thing that we are talking about is,
when you do a design and you don't understand the physics,
you don't know if what you have designed will work. And
that's the bottom line.
Mr. Cooper. But we have competency testing for physicists, and
some are better than others.
Dr. Peercy. That is certainly true.
Mr. Cooper. And, presumably, lab directors pay and reward
those who do a better job.
Dr. Dahlburg. Sure, but----
Mr. Cooper. And they test them with real-world circumstances.
They are doing testing today. They are not sitting on
their hands.
Dr. Dahlburg. No, it is true. But that is why we have--I mean,
as you know, we have experimental science because even the
best physicists in the world can be surprised by----
Mr. Cooper. But they are testing today, different things.
Dr. Peercy. They are testing the capability of given a problem
in which you actually can figure out the physics, you can
solve that problem. Now, if I give you a problem which you
can't solve, you can't solve it. And that is what we are
talking about.
Mr. Cooper. Well, you have confused me, but not being a
physicist, I am somewhat handicapped, but I will turn that
over to the chairman.
Mr. Rogers. Someone who is really handicapped there. Listen,
thank you all very much. You have been very helpful. We
appreciate your participation. For other members who
couldn't be here to ask some questions, we will submit to
you in writing, and then ask that you respond to those in
a timely manner if you could. With that, this hearing is
adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 4:10 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MR. ROGERS

Mr. Rogers. Your group's report says that some ``recent design
studies have been good analysis and modeling exercises, but they did
not result in the actual engineering and fabrication of components and
systems.'' Why is this distinction important--why should the labs be
pursuing actual engineering and prototype fabrication (with the clear
guidance that the weapon would not actually be produced and deployed)?
Dr. Peercy and Dr. Dahlburg. Analysis and modeling alone, no matter
how carefully and expertly performed, can only be an approximation to
reality, and the validity is limited by our assumptions and by gaps in
our knowledge of physics at the extreme scales of nuclear weapons
science. The Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC) Program has
improved understanding of weapons physics and has enabled the
performance of unique basic science experiments. The data generated are
useful in peer reviews and for providing feedback to nuclear explosive
package (NEP) designers. However, ASC alone does not exercise the
complete set of skills needed for actual design and engineering of an
NEP. I fully concur with our committee's assessment of the future,
wherein maintaining the full range of nuclear weapon design skills at
the NEP laboratories--as well as production skills within the NNSA
complex--is essential, to achieve three objectives: 1) Maintaining a
credible nuclear deterrent workforce that is capable of designing and
building weapons to meet evolving threats; 2) Understanding the status
and direction of foreign nuclear weapon programs and thus strengthening
the nonproliferation regime; and, 3) Determining the best and most
cost-effective approaches to resolving problems that arise during
stockpile weapons surveillance and Life-Extension Programs (LEPs).
REF: Report pages 25, 48, 49.
Mr. Rogers. In carrying out the Stockpile Responsiveness Program
created by section 3112 of the FY2016 NDAA, should the program
specifically look at new designs and creative solutions, or should it
adhere solely to existing weapon designs and techniques? Is this the
program to pursue the ``clean slate'' designs your report recommends?
Dr. Peercy and Dr. Dahlburg. While our study did not examine the
Stockpile Responsiveness Program per se, the recommendations in our
report suggest that such a program should explore the full spectrum of
technical creativity and innovation that would be consistent with a
true blank slate design competition that includes engineering and
building a prototype; the report specifies that prototype design and
production should exercise the full range of skills in the NNSA complex
needed to produce a new weapon. However, it is important at the same
time to keep in mind that the series of design competitions that the
report recommends--which include designing, engineering, building, and
non-nuclear testing of a prototype, with the non-nuclear components
integrated into the design and fabrication of the prototype--are also
envisioned by the committee to be of modest cost and managed so as to
impact neither the cost of nor the schedule for delivering Life
Extension Programs (LEPs) or the 3+2 program plan.
REF: Report pages 48, 49.
Mr. Rogers. Regarding your study's recommendation for full and
robust design competitions, can you elaborate on how they should be
conducted? How often do you recommend such competitions be conducted,
what would they entail, how many people would be involved, and how much
would they cost? Do you envision this effort would require significant
additional funding, or could it be accomplished through a repurposing
of existing research and development programs? Do you think design
competitions would detract from or complement other weapons programs,
like life extension programs and infrastructure modernization?
Dr. Peercy and Dr. Dahlburg. Roughly speaking, the committee
imagines a design competition as involving a few dozen laboratory staff
members, with a larger number in the first year of each competition,
plus some prototype development and experiments up to and including
hydrodynamic tests. Such design competitions should be initiated
periodically (perhaps every five years) to allow learning from mistakes
and for the continuous development of judgment and skills of the
nuclear weapons enterprise workforce. Regarding impact to other
programs, our committee's consensus view is that the laboratory staff
activities that would take place during the alternative design
competitions would be focused applications of science and engineering
skills that should happen anyway under the laboratories' science
campaign and engineering campaign, so that the incremental cost of the
competitions would be modest, while the benefit to the nation would be
immense.

QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MR. COOPER
Mr. Cooper. Could the NNSA labs do more to leverage other entities
for peer review, such as the JASONs group, the Atomic Weapons
Establishment in the United Kingdom, or cleared groups of university or
industry experts? Would this lead to gains in effectiveness or
efficiency?
Dr. Peercy and Dr. Dahlburg. First, our study committee observed
that all three of the nuclear weapons labs currently recognize the need
for and thus exercise the relevant multiple types of review, including:
external peer review, involving persons actively engaged in equivalent
work outside the lab who review a lab's work in an particular area;
internal peer review, involving persons from the same lab actively
engaged in equivalent work (but not in the work being reviewed), who
review the lab's work in the given area; subject-matter reviews,
involving internal and external subject matter experts, who review a
lab's execution of, or capabilities in, particular areas of science and
engineering; and, technical reviews of programs or projects, involving
internal and external experts, such as this question addresses, who may
not have as full a range of expertise as the people performing the
original work but who provide technical scrutiny and checking of
selected aspects of the work. Then, on the topic of the nuclear
weapons-related systems and science reviews that the labs currently
participate in during a typical year, the committee developed the
following semi-quantitative conclusions: 1) Each lab already
participates in some 800 nuclear weapons systems and/or weapons
science-related peer reviews in a given year; 2) About half of those
reviews are internal and the other half involve some experts from other
NNSA labs and/or from outside the nuclear weapons complex; and, 3)
Substantial staff time and resources are involved in organizing,
preparing for, conducting, and responding to these already ongoing
reviews. Hence, we concluded that in the main, these processes are
already healthy and robust, and accordingly our report's
recommendations for improvement are modest, i.e., that LLNL and LANL
should ensure short written guidance for a graded approach to peer
review, and SNL should strengthen and broaden its use of outside
experts on its peer review teams.
REF: Report pages 11, 26, 42, 44.
Mr. Cooper. The report notes that ``Recommendation 4 [the
recommendation to build prototypes based on new designs] might be seen
by some critics as promoting an aggressive posture that would put the
United States in a position to manufacture new nuclear weapons quickly
and thus fuel a new global nuclear arms race.'' Can you elaborate on
these risks?
Dr. Peercy and Dr. Dahlburg. To avoid the fundamental risk of
losing a core capability that could be essential for responding to
evolving national security threats, our committee realized that the
NNSA complex needs a means of exercising, on a regular and ongoing
basis, the full suite of nuclear weapons design, development, and
engineering capabilities through true design competitions. To clarify
what we envision these competitions to encompass, in order to minimize
the possibility of our report being misunderstood, we explicitly noted
that a prototype developed in a design competition should be a
``nuclear device,'' not a warhead. Implementation of our Recommendation
4 would help develop and maintain the most important of national
nuclear security assets--a competent, focused workforce with
demonstrated skills and judgment--and would instill confidence by all
stakeholders (including adversaries) in the ability of this workforce
to maintain the nuclear deterrent.
REF: Report pages 5, 6, 49.
Mr. Cooper. Your report stresses that a ``clean slate'' design
competition is important. Would this respond to specific military
requirements? Would it help sustain the current arsenal, or be geared
toward developing a new arsenal? How often do you recommend such
efforts be conducted, what would they entail, and how much would they
cost? How would you ensure that this effort does not detract from other
priorities such as life extension programs and infrastructure
modernization, or from the mission of understanding foreign nuclear
weapons designs? Are there any risks of using a clean slate approach to
new nuclear weapons designs and building prototypes?
Dr. Peercy and Dr. Dahlburg. Our report did not propose linking
these design competitions to specific military requirements. However,
we noted that the design should be such that the consensus of the
design community would be that the design could be certified in a
manner consistent with the nuclear testing moratorium--that is, it
should be close enough to a vetted design to permit that consensus.
Once hands-on experience of the NEP labs' science and engineering
personnel in nuclear weapons design or testing would be lost, it could
seriously compromise the nation's defensive posture and would be
difficult to reestablish. The committee unanimously judged that a blank
slate approach to exercising the full range of skills in the NNSA
complex needed to produce a new weapon should significantly help to
ameliorate this immense risk. Please note that the other questions
raised here are addressed in my responses to Questions #2 and #3 above.
REF: Report pages 47, 49.
Mr. Cooper. What other skills are not exercised through life
extension programs? And should those be exercised as well?
Dr. Peercy and Dr. Dahlburg. Life Extension Programs (LEPs) for the
warheads in the enduring stockpile systems are planned far in advance,
and extend over the next several decades. In an LEP, components that
are known to suffer from deterioration or obsolescence within the time
frame considered in the LEP are replaced; other components that may
degrade more slowly with time or fail abruptly after a time longer than
that examined may or may not be replaced. As a result, the ``aging
clock'' of these latter components continues to tick. In some LEPs,
components may need to be changed to improve the safety and security of
the warhead. Assessment of the performance of changed components is a
significant challenge, especially because the skills associated with
designing and developing nuclear explosive packages--and, in the
process, strengthening understanding of the linkages between the design
and performance--have not been thoroughly exercised in the nuclear
weapons complex for more than 20 years. From the perspective of a long-
term view, the nation must have in place the capability to anticipate
and respond to potential new threats the country could face in the
future. To attempt this with a future workforce without validated
experience in weapon design and development would be very risky.
Accordingly, reliably validated workforce experience should be
cultivated and routinely exercised, in complement with and also in
support of LEPs.
REF: Report pages 40, 41.
Mr. Cooper. The report notes that engineering and producing
prototypes of new nuclear weapons designs will help address evolving
threats. What are these threats and how would building new prototypes
help address them?
Dr. Peercy and Dr. Dahlburg. Perhaps even in the later years of the
Cold War, the nuclear threat landscape appeared more static, and the
United States stabilized and reduced its stockpile. After the cessation
of nuclear explosion testing, the United States and its allies put
their main efforts into maintaining the existing stockpile. Today, as
foreign stockpiles and their doctrines for use are modernizing, several
countries are contemplating the development of nuclear capabilities,
and terrorism is spreading around the world, the nuclear threat
landscape consequently is again evolving. NNSA, entrusted with the
responsibility of ensuring unimpeachable confidence in the nation's
nuclear warheads through its nuclear complex--which consists of the
three nuclear weapons labs, the test site, and the production plants--
requires for proper preparedness a focused science and engineering
enterprise of high quality and technical staff of high competence and
good judgment. The functions of peer review and design competition
contribute essentially to these attributes, and accordingly both
functions should be exercised routinely.
REF: Report pages 40, 41.
Mr. Cooper. Are there other means, such as advanced computer
simulation, that could help understand new designs?
Dr. Peercy and Dr. Dahlburg. Advanced computer simulations would be
essential to every step of the design competitions we recommend.
However, as noted in response to Question #1, analysis and modeling
alone, no matter how carefully and expertly performed, can only be an
approximation to reality, and the validity is limited by our
assumptions and by gaps in our knowledge of physics at the extreme
scales of nuclear weapons science.
Mr. Cooper. Are there any risks to the quality of peer review done
between Los Alamos National Laboratory and Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory if the members of the boards of both labs are identical?
Might a same board provide and require the same incentives or promote
the same culture, that could limit the maximum effectiveness of peer
review, that might not otherwise be true of other independent peer
reviews? What measures are in place to mitigate such risks?
Dr. Peercy and Dr. Dahlburg. The report alludes to this concern in
the first full paragraph on p. 28, which reads as follows:
``With many staff and managers moving from one laboratory to
another today, and with continued encouragement from DOE/NNSA and
others for the two NEP laboratories to cooperate--including sharing
codes and analysis practices--some observers have raised the concern
that the laboratories' independence may be compromised by moving toward
more commonality. The laboratory directors should monitor the
composition of peer review panels to avoid this possibility.''
Our committee believes that as long as each lab director is
independently attentive and vigilant about this issue, such a
possibility will be avoided.
Mr. Cooper. Did any members of the NAS committee that wrote this
report have ongoing contracts with either of the NNSA nuclear design
laboratories?
Dr. Peercy and Dr. Dahlburg. I understand that that this sort of
question is one that is faced by nearly all Academies studies. How does
one attract the most knowledgeable experts on a particular subject to
serve on the study committee and yet ensure that the committee's
deliberations are not influenced by particular matters that give rise
to conflicts of interest? The Academies have developed an elaborate
vetting process used in forming committees, to balance any biases and
ensure that study members will not benefit financially from potential
committee activities or recommendations. The National Academies vetting
process was fully exercised for our study. Moreover, the report of our
14-member committee is a consensus product; all members agreed with the
entire document, which was also reviewed by an independent set of nine
outside experts (listed in the report). Because it successfully went
through that external review, the report is an official product of the
National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, and not of
the study committee members.
______

QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MR. FRANKS
Mr. Franks. How urgent is the issue of expert nuclear scientists
and engineers, who know how to design and build these nuclear devices,
retiring and leaving the industry? Will these competitive design
programs mitigate these critical losses?
Dr. Peercy and Dr. Dahlburg. The number of nuclear explosion
package (NEP) laboratories' science and engineering personnel with
hands-on experience in nuclear weapons design and nuclear explosion
testing continues to decrease and--unless changes are made--this number
will reach zero in the next decade or so. Once NEP hands-on experience
would be lost, it could limit the nation's strategic options, and it
would be difficult to reestablish. Accordingly, the issue is very
urgent. Although it was considered too expensive for every design
competition to result in the production of a prototype during the Cold
War, those competitions that did reach the prototyping stage provided
the feedback that designers needed to stay at the cutting edge. Hence,
today as well, design competitions, and the subsequent testing of
components, subsystems, and systems (within the limits of national
policy and agreements) are critical to developing the next generation
NEP designers with expertise that goes beyond analysis and modeling. It
is the committee's strong consensus view that design competitions as
described in our report would exercise the full set of NEP design
skills necessary for an effective nuclear deterrent.
