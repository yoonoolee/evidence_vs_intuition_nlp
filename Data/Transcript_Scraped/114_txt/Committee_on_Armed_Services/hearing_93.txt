U.S. STRATEGIC FORCES POSTURE

----------

House of Representatives,
Committee on Armed Services,
Subcommittee on Strategic Forces,
Washington, DC, Wednesday, February 24, 2016.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 3:33 p.m., in
room 2118, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Mike Rogers
(chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE ROGERS, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM
ALABAMA, CHAIRMAN, SUBCOMMITTEE ON STRATEGIC FORCES

Mr. Rogers. I would like to call this hearing to order,
this hearing of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on
Strategic Forces.
Today we are focused on the U.S. strategic forces posture,
and we have again this year a tremendous pair of witnesses--no
pressure, fellas--the Honorable Brian McKeon, Principal Deputy
Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, Department of Defense,
and Admiral Cecil Haney, Commander, STRATCOM [U.S. Strategic
Command].
I want to, as always, thank you all for the time it takes
to prepare for these. I know it is an inconvenience, it takes a
lot of time and effort, but it is very helpful to us. So I do
appreciate that.
We also appreciate the seriousness with which you have
prepared for this hearing, and I assure you, we approach our
responsibility to provide oversight policy and funding
authorization for the Nation's nuclear deterrent, missile
defense, and national security space systems and capabilities
with the same seriousness.
Your testimony will directly inform the policy and funding
authorization decisions we make in the coming weeks as we
prepare for the NDAA [National Defense Authorization Act].
These three mission areas could not be more important, indeed
existential, to the Nation's security.
Admiral Haney, I noted your recent appearance at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies when you stated, quote:
``We are out of time. Sustainment is a must. Recapitalization
is a requirement . . . Our budget has a deterrent value of its
own and reflects our Nation's commitment to our deterrent
strategy . . . Our adversaries pay close attention to whether
we back up our words with resources . . . Our choice is not
between keeping the current forces or replacing them. Rather,
the choice is between replacing those forces or risk not having
them at all.'' Close quote.
Admiral Haney, I hope you repeat this point as often as you
can.
To many in the public policy and advocacy machine in this
city, they either aren't aware of this fact or they are
willfully choosing to ignore it. We can't help those who are
willingly choosing ignorance, but we shouldn't give up on those
who just aren't aware of the facts.
Mr. McKeon, I know you spent a significant amount of time
and energy in the Department's Nuclear Enterprise Review of
2013. I am eager to hear how you are ensuring the momentum
achieved during this review is maintained, especially as we see
key recommendations, like the replacement of Vietnam-era
missile field security helicopters, that are languishing in red
tape in the Air Force and the Joint Staff.
And I know I don't have to tell you, but I feel it is
essential that the American people are aware of the increasing
threat we face in outer space. We are facing serious and
growing foreign threats to our space systems. We need to work
closely with STRATCOM and OSD [Office of the Secretary of
Defense] to ensure that the warfighter has the capabilities and
authorities to fight and win a war should it extend into space.
With that, I recognize the gentleman, my friend from
Tennessee, Mr. Cooper, for any opening statement he may want to
make.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Rogers can be found in the
Appendix on page 23.]

STATEMENT OF HON. JIM COOPER, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM TENNESSEE,
RANKING MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON STRATEGIC FORCES

Mr. Cooper. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I would like to add my voice in welcoming the witnesses,
and also emphasize for this public portion of the hearing that
there probably are no more important issues that our Nation or
the world faces, because these are existential issues. We have
got to get this right. And I appreciate the long professional
involvement of both of our witnesses in making sure that we do
get these vital existential issues correct.
It is also important from a fiscal standpoint, because
literally this is a trillion-dollar subject here, and we have
got to get that right as well to make sure that we have a safe,
secure, and reliable nuclear deterrent as efficiently as
possible. And that costs real money, because we are also
talking long-range bombers here, we are talking about new
submarines, we are talking about keeping our ICBM
[intercontinental ballistic missile] missile fields state of
the art.
So these are extremely important topics. Sadly, a lot of
our duties have to be held in secret. But I welcome the
witnesses and look forward both to the public and the private
portions of this hearing.
Mr. Rogers. Thank you.
And as always, your full opening statements will be
accepted for the record, without objection.
And now I recognize you, Mr. McKeon, for 5 minutes to
summarize your opening statement.

STATEMENT OF HON. BRIAN P. McKEON, PRINCIPAL DEPUTY UNDER
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR POLICY, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

Mr. McKeon. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Cooper, members of
the subcommittee. Thank you for this opportunity to testify
today on the fiscal year 2017 budget request for strategic
forces. We are grateful in the Department for your continuing
support of this critical mission of nuclear deterrence and
nonproliferation.
Earlier this month, Secretary Carter identified five
evolving challenges that have driven the focus of the Defense
Department's planning and budgeting this year. The first and
second challenges reflect a return to great power competition
with Russia and China; third is North Korea; fourth, Iran; and
fifth, our ongoing fight against terrorist organizations.
Each has implications for our current or planned strategic
capabilities and posture. Let me address each of these briefly
in turn.
First, China is introducing qualitative advances into its
nuclear and conventional military capabilities as it continues
to rise in the Asia-Pacific region. We will continue our
rebalance to maintain the regional stability that we have
underwritten for 70 years and that has allowed many nations to
prosper.
Second, Russia poses one of our most pressing and evolving
strategic challenges, challenges felt across the strategic
forces mission. Russia has undertaken aggressive actions in
Crimea, and elsewhere in Ukraine, and has adapted a pattern of
reckless nuclear posturing and coercive threats. Russia remains
in violation of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces [INF]
Treaty, and Russia remains unreceptive to the President's offer
to negotiate further reductions following the New START
[Strategic Arms Reduction] Treaty.
Third, North Korea's evolving nuclear weapons and missile
programs pose a continuing threat to the United States and our
allies and partners. Last month, North Korea conducted its
fourth nuclear test, and earlier this month conducted a
ballistic missile launch that successfully placed a satellite
into orbit.
Fourth, as we work to counter Iran's malign influence
against our allies and partners in the Middle East, we will
remain vigilant for any reversal of course by Iran on its
commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
Iran's ballistic missile program is the largest in the region,
and we must continue to enhance our ability to defend against
this ballistic missile threat today and in the future. As
Secretary Carter has underscored, the nuclear deal does not in
any way constrain or inhibit the ability of the United States
to defend itself or our allies and partners.
Finally, denying terrorists access to weapons of mass
destruction and weapons-usable materials is an absolute
imperative in the ongoing fight to defeat terrorist
organizations.
Let me focus briefly on some key details in the fiscal year
2017 budget.
First, on nuclear deterrence, although the President's
ultimate goal is a world without nuclear weapons, he has been
clear in his commitment to maintain a safe, secure, and
effective nuclear arsenal for as long as nuclear weapons exist.
This is the highest priority of the Department of Defense.
We work closely with the Department of Energy to maintain the
safety and security of our nuclear forces at the lowest
possible number of weapons consistent with retaining a full set
of options to respond to and to address current and potential
threats.
Our budget request focuses on maintaining stable and robust
deterrence in a time of geopolitical uncertainty while also
managing the transition to a modernized nuclear force through
life extension programs for warheads, replacement of aging
delivery systems, and enhancements to sustainment and
operations of the current force. It also includes funding
necessary to continue addressing the findings of the nuclear
enterprise reviews.
Our plan is fully consistent with the administration policy
of a reduced role for nuclear weapons in our defense strategy
and retains only those capabilities we need to sustain stable
and effective deterrence.
The effort to modernize our delivery systems and extend the
life of our warheads across the triad and our nonstrategic
nuclear force will require significant resources over the next
decade and beyond. This critical investment is affordable if
prioritized appropriately by the Department, the Congress, and
the Nation.
On missile defense, our request funds the development and
deployment of a robust ballistic missile defense capability to
protect our homeland, deployed forces, and allies and partners.
North Korea's launch, which I recently mentioned, underscores
the importance of BMD [ballistic missile defense] in protecting
the homeland and the need to increase the number of our
deployed Ground-based Interceptors to 44, develop a redesigned
kill vehicle, and proceed with the development of Long-Range
Discrimination Radar. Our budget funds all of these.
As North Korea and potentially Iran make progress on ICBM-
class missile technologies, we must be prepared to address new,
more complex threats in the next decade. To that end, our
budget requests funding for investments in new technologies,
including directed energy and the Multi-Object Kill Vehicle.
Progress on these technologies, as well as adapting current
technologies to new purposes, will enable us to meet the
advancing threat and lower the costs of intercepting ballistic
missiles.
Our budget also reflects the Department's commitment to
building regional missile defenses that are interoperable with
systems deployed by international partners. We continue to
implement the European Phased Adaptive Approach [EPAA] to
missile defense, which is designed to protect our deployed
forces and allies in Europe from attacks emanating from the
Middle East.
In December of last year, the Missile Defense Agency
declared the Aegis Ashore defense system in Romania technically
capable of defending against Iranian ballistic missiles. The
request supports the implementation of phase three of EPAA,
including the upcoming groundbreaking at the Aegis Ashore site
in Poland, which will be completed in the 2018 timeframe.
Mr. Chairman, let me briefly touch on space. In his
Worldwide Threat Assessment testimony earlier this month, the
Director of National Intelligence said that Russia and China
understand how our military fights and how heavily we rely on
space, and they are each pursuing destructive and disruptive
antisatellite systems.
To address these concerns, the Department conducted a
portfolio-wide strategic review of our space systems, focusing
on how we assure space capabilities in light of current and
future threats. The results included significant new
adjustments in the budget, starting with last year and
continuing in this year. In addition, we are strengthening the
governance of our space enterprise and providing an independent
voice in providing assessments to the Secretary.
At Air Force Space Command, we have established a Joint
Interagency and Combined Space Operations Center that will
allow us to experiment with new operational concepts across the
national security space enterprise and develop new concepts and
associated tactics for future operations.
We appreciate your support and review of this budget, which
is critical to our national defense. Thank you.
[The prepared statement of Mr. McKeon can be found in the
Appendix on page 25.]
Mr. Rogers. Thank you.
Admiral Haney, you are recognized for 5 minutes.

STATEMENT OF ADM CECIL D. HANEY, USN, COMMANDER, U.S. STRATEGIC
COMMAND

Admiral Haney. Good afternoon, Chairman Rogers and Ranking
Member Cooper and members of this committee. I am honored to be
with you today, and I am pleased to testify with Principal
Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Mr. Brian McKeon.
I am also honored to be here to represent my sailors,
soldiers, airmen, and marines and civilians, my team, who carry
out the very missions assigned to U.S. Strategic Command. They
are dedicated professionals who represent our most precious
resource and deserve our unwavering support.
As a result of their efforts, our Nation's strategic
nuclear deterrent force remains safe, secure, and effective and
ready, and we are working hard to improve the resilience and
flexibility in space and cyberspace. It is crucial that we
modernize our strategic nuclear deterrence capabilities, which
underpin our Nation's security.
As you know, the current global security environment is
more complex, dynamic, and uncertain than possibly at any time
in our history, and our adversaries and potential adversaries
challenge our democratic values and our security in so many
ways. They are modernizing and expanding their nuclear
capabilities, developing and testing counterspace and
cyberspace technologies, and are advancing conventional and
asymmetric weapons.
Future deterrence scenarios will likely include multiple
adversaries operating across multiple domains using anti-
access/area denial, asymmetric warfare, and escalate-to-
deescalate tactics. These trends affect strategic stability.
Given all of this, the missions of U.S. Strategic Command
remain important to our joint military forces, our Nation, and
our allies and our partners.
My command priorities guide our efforts. Comprehensive
strategic deterrence, assurance, and escalation control is far
more than just nuclear weapons and platforms. It also includes
a robust foundational intelligence apparatus, space,
cyberspace, conventional and missile defense capabilities, and
comprehensive plans that link organizations together in a
coherent manner.
Additionally, we engage daily in a broad range of
activities across our other mission areas: intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance; countering weapons of mass
destruction; joint electronic warfare; and analysis and
targeting.
Achieving comprehensive strategic deterrence, assurance,
and escalation control requires a long-term approach to
investing in capabilities and a multigenerational commitment to
intellectual capital. The President's budget for fiscal year
2017 strikes a responsible balance between national priorities,
fiscal realities, and begins to reduce some of the risks we
have accumulated because of deferred maintenance and
sustainment. This budget supports my mission requirements, but
there is no margin to absorb new risk. Any cuts to that budget
will hamper our ability to sustain and modernize our military
forces.
I thank you for this opportunity, and I look forward to
your questions.
[The prepared statement of Admiral Haney can be found in
the Appendix on page 40.]
Mr. Rogers. I thank you both for those opening statements.
Now we will start with questions. I will recognize myself
first.
For both of you, have both of you participated in a nuclear
exercise to demonstrate how the people and systems would work
if they are ever called upon?
Start with you, Mr. McKeon.
Mr. McKeon. Mr. Chairman, in my prior job in the White
House, I took part in an exercise with the director of the
White House Military Office. It was somewhere in 2013. I can't
remember the date.
Mr. Rogers. Admiral Haney.
Admiral Haney. Chairman, I have participated in a number of
exercises as part of my job, as a minimum once a quarter, but I
can't tell you how many I have had.
Mr. Rogers. On nuclear exercises, was it your experience
that the people and systems performed as you expected in those
exercises?
Admiral Haney. Yes, Chairman, they did.
Mr. Rogers. Mr. McKeon.
Mr. McKeon. Yes, they did. And part of the exercise that I
was on was working on quality of the communications, and they
actually performed better than we expected.
Mr. Rogers. Good. Mr. McKeon, to your knowledge, in your
tenure at NSC [National Security Council] and DOD [Department
of Defense], has President Obama actually participated in such
an exercise?
Mr. McKeon. I don't know the answer to that, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Rogers. Okay. Could you find out and let me know back
at your convenience?
Mr. McKeon. We can check.
Mr. Rogers. Admiral Haney, I call your attention to the
charts on your TV screens to your left and right. These show
the so-called acquisition bow wave in the Department of
Defense. Is this a nuclear bow wave or does the Department have
an acquisition bow wave across the services in practically
every capacity? The chart may not be that helpful to you.
[The chart referred to can be found in the Appendix on page
71.]
Admiral Haney. Chairman, I have seen a variety of charts
relative to the need in our current plan in terms of needing
resources in order to recapitalize and modernize our strategic
forces. As you know, we have in many cases stretched out well
beyond the life expectancy of many of our programs, and now we
are at a point where we have to modernize various facets of our
triad as well as our nuclear command and control capabilities.
So that is what is creating this bow wave of sort that is
discussed in various things, such as the Congressional Budget
Office reports and what have you, that quantify it thereabouts
5 to 6 percent of our associated expected departmental budget
over those years.
Mr. Rogers. Mr. McKeon, is the modernization of deterrent
the highest priority of the Department of Defense?
Mr. McKeon. It is, yes. And the Secretary, I believe, has
testified to that in the past.
Mr. Rogers. Excellent.
We hear--and this is also for you--we hear some people
saying that the need to have a debate on modernization of the
triad. What are your thoughts on this? Has the administration
not debated these issues? Has the President not made his
decisions in Congress as well?
Mr. McKeon. Mr. Chairman, I think I have seen some of the
comments you may be referring to, and those are interesting
comments, but they don't reflect the policy of the President or
the administration.
We have clear policy guidance from the Nuclear Posture
Review, from the review on employment that was conducted early
in the second term, and from the last Quadrennial Defense
Review, and that guidance says we shall have a triad. And that
is what we need to sustain and that is what we need to
modernize. We won't be here for these investments--or at least
I won't--in the next administration, but we are laying the
foundation for the way ahead.
Mr. Rogers. Excellent.
Admiral Haney, I noted your stated concerns about the idea
of overflights of the U.S. by Russia with a new advanced
electro-optical sensor. The treaty also allows the Russian
Federation to overfly the United States with infrared and
synthetic aperture radar sensors. If electro-optical capability
is at risk, what of these even more advanced capabilities, are
they a risk?
Admiral Haney. Chairman, regarding the Open Skies Treaty,
as we look at how technology has developed, it is not
surprising to me that there would be a desire to use more
advanced capabilities in order to conduct that Open Skies
Treaty.
While I am concerned in terms of overflights of any ability
of another nation to learn more about our overall critical
infrastructure, I do have respect for said treaty in terms of
the 32-some nations that are also part of that treaty, in which
it allows for transparency and the ability of sharing
immediately that information that that treaty is associated
with.
So as we make these advances and as Russia is asked to
apply additional capability, there is a process that is going
through by which this is being assessed. And I feel that I have
a voice in that process going forward here as we measure the
pluses and minuses associated with that approach.
Mr. Rogers. Well, you realize that Congress as policymakers
are going to need to take those risks into consideration and we
depend on you to give us a heads-up as to what you see is the
most threatening of those risks. And that is why I asked the
question.
With that, I will turn to the ranking member for any
questions he may have.
Mr. Cooper. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Let me point out the obvious here, which is there is an
astonishing national consensus in both parties, among most all
people, that the triad is important; in fact, it is vital to
our national security, and it is our duty to keep it safe,
secure, and reliable. That includes all the life extension
programs, upgrades, to keep that capability state of the art.
We almost should be thankful that we face a few rivals and
would-be rivals in the area, because think of how difficult it
would be to fund all this if there were none. So now we have
something to complain about and also build support behind.
But it is our unquestioned superiority that is what we must
maintain. And I am just thankful that there is such a
bipartisan consensus on these issues and that the admiral can
testify in favor of the President's budget request
wholeheartedly.
I hope that this Congress will not only fund that amount,
but actually find the real dollars to support it and not borrow
that money, as we have for many other DOD expenditures.
Mr. McKeon, on a much, much smaller issue, the Cooperative
Threat Reduction Program is an important program, and I
understand that you would like to expound on some of the
activities happening in North Africa regarding that program.
Mr. McKeon. Mr. Cooper, thank you.
As you and I discussed briefly this morning in the office
call, we have recently begun work on a Cooperative Threat
Reduction Program in North Africa. As you know, this program
had its roots at the end of the Cold War in the former Soviet
Union, but over time it has expanded and Congress has given us
the authority to expand this to other regions.
And its specific authority here is to address an emerging
proliferation threat. And what we are embarking on is working
with the Government of Tunisia to strengthen its border and
security of its border with Libya, which is quite porous, a lot
of people moving back and forth across it. You are probably
aware of the strike we took in western Libya this weekend
against several people in a camp, including a leader suspected
of the Bardo Museum attack in Tunis last year.
So we think this is an important and urgent project because
of the threat to Tunisia of terrorists moving across that
border, as well as from ISIS [Islamic State of Iraq and Syria]
and from AQIM [Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb], in its western
mountains. We have seen ISIS using sulfur mustard in Iraq and
Syria, so it is not a leap to suggest they might undertake
similar attacks in Libya.
And so we are very focused on trying to help the Government
of Tunisia, which started the Arab Spring and seeks to build on
a new democracy, and it is under threat from a lot of places.
Mr. Cooper. So this is an emerging threat on the Tunisian
border to prevent Libyan WMD [weapons of mass destruction], not
nuclear but chemical, from possibly crossing that border?
Mr. McKeon. That is correct. And I should say, Mr. Cooper,
we have done similar projects strengthening border with an eye
toward the WMD issue in Ukraine in the last couple of years and
in Jordan as well.
Mr. Cooper. Oh, I appreciate that clarification.
Mr. Chairman, I have no more questions at this time.
Mr. Rogers. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from
Colorado, Mr. Lamborn, for 5 minutes.
Mr. Lamborn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you both for being here and for the work that you
each do for our country.
Admiral Haney, it is always good to talk with you. Thank
you for our earlier visit. And I would like to follow up on
something we chatted about briefly earlier, and that is the
JICSpOC [Joint Interagency Combined Space Operations Center].
And I am encouraged to see that you are using rapid acquisition
authority for that and also to see that the GEON [GPS Enhanced
Onboard Navigation] is in the budget request. When do you think
the JICSpOC will be fully operational?
Admiral Haney. Congressman Lamborn, thank you for that
question. The Joint Interagency Combined Space Operations
Center, JICSpOC, very important to me and your Strategic
Command and I think to our Nation, particularly as we work
right now through our experimentation process, which goes
through this summer, such that we can look at refining CONOPS,
concept of operations, which will further help define what we
need for the future.
So we have completed a couple of those experiments, pretty
elaborate, bring in professionals across our Department of
Defense space as well as our Intelligence Community space,
coming together, working in a synergetic way so that we can
look at how do we have space indications and warnings,
situational awareness, attribution capability, all the way to
what to do about it if that occurs.
As such, this will take some time. I don't have a discrete
timeline for you right now. We are working with the Office of
Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff, and others in terms of
providing those refined concepts of operation, which will
further define that timeline. But I am encouraged that we have
some capability just in where we have experimented if we needed
to pull it together in a hurry to take matters at hand.
Mr. Lamborn. Okay, thank you.
And for anyone who is unaware of what is happening here, it
is just a way of integrating the DOD and the Intelligence
Community so that they can look at space assets and what they
have to offer together. In other words, the integration part is
so critical there.
Do you see roadblocks going forward? And do you have all
the authorities you need to make sure this capability gets
fielded as rapidly as it needs to be?
Admiral Haney. Congressman, as part of this, we are working
through to really understand those authorities either we may
need in heightened tensions and what have you, in that regard,
as we work through various scenarios associated with it.
As of right this moment, I have the authorities I need in
order to work through this concept. There may become a time in
the future where additional authorities are required.
Mr. Lamborn. And do you see any roadblocks on the way going
forward?
Admiral Haney. Right now, the biggest roadblock, I would
say, is working to establish what frequently is called, like, a
common operational picture, and how we can look at the
dynamics, space situational awareness, in a more refined manner
as we look at the threats that other nations are working in
their counterspace programs. We are working on that, as you
mentioned the GEON-type concept, as a team right now. But we
have to get there, and we are working on helping to define that
through this experimental phase of the JICSpOC.
Mr. Lamborn. Okay. Thank you so much.
And I am going to shift gears completely. And this is kind
of technical, but it is an important question that I have
worked with staff on. The Air Force is completing its analyses
of alternatives for the OPIR [Overhead Persistent Infrared] and
AEH[F] [Advanced Extremely High Frequency] systems. Can you
assure us that the analysis of alternatives will fully take
into account your requirements, that is the warfighter
requirements? And can you send us, send the committee written
details on the AOAs when the AOAs are completed?
Admiral Haney. Congressman, I would say yes to both
questions. I work very closely with the Air Force and with the
principal Department of Defense space adviser, Secretary James,
as well as the Office of Secretary of Defense staff as we look
at this going forward. But I am a teammate in terms of working
the analysis of alternatives for those programs.
Mr. Lamborn. Thank you so much.
Mr. Rogers. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from
Nebraska, Mr. Ashford, for 5 minutes.
Mr. Ashford. Thank you.
Admiral Haney, thanks again for keeping me abreast and our
office abreast of the issues that you are raising here today
and other issues as we have been proceeding along. And thank
you for your work at Offutt and at STRATCOM in our area. It is
exemplary work and admired by everyone. So thank you.
I just want to, if I could, just reiterate what the
chairman asked about the Open Skies issue. I did notice in our
Omaha World-Herald today a discussion that you had had
concerning that. And I would second the chairman's comments
about, as we move forward, to be clear as to what we should or
shouldn't do in regard to that. And also the fact that we do
have missions from Offutt in the 55th that are part of that
Open Sky, and so obviously have concerns about it in that
regard. So anything you can do to keep us abreast would be
great.
I have a question though, totally unrelated, really, I
think to probably the budget, and we have had this conversation
before. And one of the concerns, very briefly, and we can talk
about it further later, but this whole idea of standardizing
cyber education and cybersecurity issues so that as this
becomes more advanced and as the need for workforce in this
area increases.
What are your thoughts generally about trying to come up
with some kind of standardized way to train our cyber force,
and as the threats are so dynamic, so frequently changing, that
if we have some sort of standardized way to educate our people?
Do you have any general thoughts on that?
Admiral Haney. Congressman Ashford, first and foremost, the
Department is working--Joint Staff is working--on an approach
to ensure all of our employees, all of our workforce, all of
our sailors, soldiers, airmen, marines, do have a basic
understanding of what we call cyber hygiene in terms of their
role, one as a sensor and reporting and understanding what
types of things they see on cyber and get those reported to the
necessary team that works that.
So you have standardization of the population as a whole
and the workforce as a whole, then you have the standardization
of the training associated with those that are at a higher
level of working cyber defense and those types of operations
for, for example, U.S. Cyber Command and the services and the
work to ensure we have the necessary capability to protect the
military systems and also to work to defend the Nation.
Mr. Ashford. As we reach out to the private sector in
obtaining expertise as we move forward, do you feel work needs
to be done in how we train those individuals so that they
better understand the standards that are applied in the
military? Do you see that evolving?
Admiral Haney. I know a lot of the industry teams I talk
to, et cetera, are very concerned about cyber as well. Across
the country as a whole I think the knowledge of the threat is
improving. I do believe we have a lot more work to go in that
regard. And my commander for U.S. Cyber Command, Mike Rogers,
has been involved in a variety of different areas in coupling
together with other outside Department of Defense organizations
in that regard.
Mr. Ashford. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Admiral.
Mr. Rogers. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from
Colorado, Mr. Coffman, for 5 minutes.
Mr. Coffman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. McKeon, you mentioned the Joint Interagency and
Combined Space Operations Center, or JICSpOC, in your written
statement. Can you briefly discuss how this effort contributes
to space mission assurance?
Mr. McKeon. Congressman Coffman, this is a little bit of an
operational experiment, as Admiral Haney said. It is for
focusing on space situational awareness and coordination
between ourselves and the IC [Intelligence Community]. And what
they have been working on is, I think, a series of vignettes to
sort of understand the operating picture and how we are
integrating with our IC colleagues and even the private sector
and some allies at some future point.
So it is still early days in it. The deputy secretary has
focused a lot on this, and he has already gone out there to pay
a visit to it. I would defer to Admiral Haney to the other
details he would have.
Mr. Coffman. Sure. Admiral Haney.
Admiral Haney. Congressman, we have been working a bit on
space mission assurance even before we had the JICSpOC. What is
nice about the JICSpOC concept is it is really honing in our
efforts and working as a team, as was mentioned here. The
business, first and foremost, very complicated environment by
which we are working in, and the key of integrating all of our
combined efforts.
And that is why taking an interagency approach to this is
very important in terms of being able to share, move
information in a timely manner, and then have a more
synergistic approach to the problem with both DOD and IC assets
going forward, particularly as we look at what our
adversaries--potential adversaries--are working toward,
everything from jamming, lasing, terrestrial launch rockets
into space, and on-orbit kind of capabilities.
Mr. Coffman. Sure. Admiral Haney--and then I will go to Mr.
McKeon--we have heard a lot about the threats from North Korea
and Iran in terms of missile threats. Can you comment on our
missile warning posture in relation to these emerging threats?
Admiral Haney. Congressman, with regard to missile warning
posture, 24/7 I have service men and women that are manning
stations, one, to very quickly report through our overall
constellation of any launch that occurs anywhere on the planet.
That information is moved quickly. It is backed up and verified
by land-based radars in terms of things so that we can
ascertain whether there is an attack against America or attack
against an ally, or is it something we expect in a test, or
what have you. And there is a process and a procedure that
moves that information all the way through command centers, and
what have you, in terms of things. So that piece, I think,
works very well today.
Mr. Coffman. Do you have anything to add, Mr. McKeon?
Mr. McKeon. I don't have anything to add to that, sir.
Mr. Coffman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
Mr. Rogers. I thank the gentleman.
The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Washington
State, Mr. Larsen, for 5 minutes.
Mr. Larsen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. McKeon, the CBO [Congressional Budget Office] has
estimated that the cost of maintaining nuclear weapons and
delivery vehicles to be approximately about $340 billion over
10 years. Is that an estimate that you agree with, the CBO
estimate?
Mr. McKeon. Maintaining the current infrastructure now,
including modernization, or just sustaining what we have?
Mr. Larsen. I think that is including modernization.
Mr. McKeon. It is probably in the ballpark, Congressman. I
think our sense of the modernization in the years ahead is
between $350 billion and $450 billion.
Mr. Larsen. Over the next 10 years?
Mr. McKeon. I think that is the number.
Mr. Larsen. And somewhere around--although 30 years is a
long way from now, we will probably all be gone by then--there
is a trillion-dollar estimate from a lot of outside groups for
over 30 years. Does that sound about right?
Mr. McKeon. I would have to check on that. It may include a
lot of ongoing sustainment and operation. It is not just the
recapitalization.
Mr. Larsen. Sure. Okay. So the point I am getting at is the
answer to your question earlier to Mr. Rogers about this being
the highest priorities in the budget. If these are the highest
priorities in the budget then, again, you mentioned you get to
go--knocking on wood we get to stick around. What does that
mean for the other priorities in the budget, without adding
dollars or adding relatively more dollars, what does that mean
longer term for budgets, defense budgets?
Mr. McKeon. Sir, it is clear that the future Congresses and
future administrations face a big challenge with this. I think
we discussed it a little bit in the hearing that Chairman
Thornberry had last summer with the deputy secretary and the
vice chairman, where we start in 2021, it is in the current
Future Years Defense Program with the Ohio Replacement Program.
And right now for the nuclear enterprise in DOD it is about 3
percent of the budget. It will grow to 5 or 6 percent during
this recapitalization period, so it is doubling, but still not
a huge part of the Department budget.
I think our leadership would say today, if we continue to
see the fiscal constraints that are in place, Budget Control
Act is still there, notwithstanding the 2-year relief from the
balanced budget deal, we would probably need some top-line
relief in the 2020s in order to accommodate this. But as
Secretary Carter said, it is the top priority, so we need to
figure out a way to pay for it.
Mr. Larsen. I would just note a doubling of billions of
dollars, even though it might be 3 percent to 5 percent, is a
lot of money.
Mr. McKeon. Indeed.
Mr. Larsen. Still a lot of money and still puts a lot of
pressure on the rest of the budget. I just want to be sure we
are clear about that.
Can you talk a little bit about the THAAD [Terminal High
Altitude Area Defense] missile defense batteries and the
discussion going on with South Korea and what we can expect. Is
South Korea ready to incorporate that into their defenses? And
if an agreement was signed today, actually how long would it
take until a THAAD system could be even operational in the ROK
[Republic of Korea]?
Mr. McKeon. As you know, we recently announced with our
Korean partners, consultations on deploying THAAD to the
Republic of Korea. And I think there is a formal meeting next
week General Scaparrotti mentioned in his testimony this
morning. And I think probably the long pole in the tent is the
site, the land for the battery. And I don't know how long that
would take to come to an agreement with the Koreans on the
funding for that.
I think once we had it in place, I don't think it would
take very long to deploy it. We have the battery available. So
I think that would be the main issue in the near term.
Mr. Larsen. Admiral Haney, you spoke a little bit this
morning, I just want to get your feedback again on a recent GAO
[Government Accountability Office] report that found that
overlapping testing and acquisition of additional interceptors
for Alaska risk compromising the reliability of the system. And
I want to know how much you would agree with that analysis, if
at all; and then related, are you concerned about the deterrent
capability of that system as a result?
Admiral Haney. Congressman, I think it is very important
relative to that report that we are able to populate our
missile fields up to that 44 number by 2017, which is the plan.
And as I look at the priorities for missile defense, it is also
very important that we are able to conduct the necessary
testing so that we can have a most reliable kill vehicle as
well as discrimination. So getting to the long-range
discriminating radar is important for a future, and in looking
at the other alternatives so that we can work that cost curve
associated with our approach per missile so that we can be even
better as a deterrent.
Mr. Larsen. Thanks.
I think that is good for me for now. Thanks. Yield back.
Mr. Rogers. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from
Oklahoma for 5 minutes.
Mr. Bridenstine. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And thank you, gentlemen, for being here and testifying
before our committee.
Admiral Haney, I wanted to talk to you for a second about
the JSpOC [Joint Space Operations Center]. We have had
opportunities to talk about it. We have heard testimony on this
committee from General Raymond, when he was JFCC Space [Joint
Functional Component Command for Space], that space is getting
more contested, more congested. And one of the challenges they
have at the JSpOC is doing all of the conjunction analysis and
reporting not only for DOD purposes but also for all the
commercial operators and foreign operators.
And as this continues, the burden is getting bigger and
bigger. And I would like to hear from your perspective, do you
believe this burden is going to continue to grow with all the
commercial activities and foreign activities in space?
Admiral Haney. I absolutely do think the activities in
space will continue to grow, which ultimately means the
activities that our Joint Space Operations Center there in
Vandenberg, California, that works space situational awareness
from that point, absolutely, will continue to grow.
Mr. Bridenstine. We have also heard testimony from General
Hyten and General Raymond about not wanting the DOD to be the
FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] for space. Is that a
concern that you share as the commander of STRATCOM?
Admiral Haney. Well, I think when we say we don't want to
be the FAA for space, what does that mean? When I hear that,
what is really being discussed is that is in the bin of what I
call space traffic control, in terms of things.
As the Department of Defense with critical capability in
space, we don't get a pass, we have to understand space
situational awareness. And I would say as the years go on,
giving where potential adversaries are investing in
counterspace capability, we are going to have to have even
better space situational awareness capability, data fusion
capability, et cetera. And this is some of the work that is
ongoing here as we experiment in the JICSpOC, the Joint
Interagency Combined Space Operations Center.
Mr. Bridenstine. Right. So the concern I have is that as we
continue moving forward with all of the activities--we have
heard, you know, OneWeb is launching a constellation of 800
satellites into low-Earth orbit [LEO], SpaceX is talking about
a constellation of 4,000 satellites into low-Earth orbit--it
seems at some point, I think everybody agrees, we have got to
make sure that the DOD is the number one entity in the world
when it comes to space situational awareness, not only taking
advantage of all of our sensors and our software, but also
taking advantage of what commercial is doing in integrating
commercial capabilities, and even what foreign countries are
doing, that are our partners and allies integrating that as
well.
My concern is that we could lose focus by really taking up
a lot of our manpower resources to do conjunction analysis when
there are two, say, commercial communication satellites in LEO,
which isn't really the case these days but in the future will
be, that conjunction analysis in mass volumes could really
burden the JSpOC in the future. And I just want to make sure
that that is something that you are thinking about as the
commander of STRATCOM as we move forward.
Admiral Haney. Absolutely, Congressman. I would just say,
as we look at this, and like you said, as Space Fence comes on
board here, the amount of data will come up, et cetera, but
there are certain attributes that have to be done even from a
space traffic control as well as space situational awareness.
And with it, we have to have information assurance. Data
protection has to be part of that as we go forward. And with it
we have to have automation and better fusion capability.
So however we do it in the future, those are the
attributes. We are clearly working and definitely thinking
about that going forward.
Mr. Bridenstine. I am running out of time here, but I just
want to get this, maybe you can respond in writing at some
point. When we go forward with the future communication
architecture, one of the challenges we have on this committee
is not getting an accurate assessment of SATCOM [satellite
communications] utilization.
What percentage of our SATCOM, how much gigabits per second
or gigabits in general are flowing through commercial vice
military, and which commercial satellites are carrying most of
the capacity, and in what regions? And do we have any
underutilized capacity? Are we purchasing capacity beyond what
we need? Maybe there are areas where we don't have enough
capacity.
So just getting an accurate assessment of SATCOM
utilization would be very valuable for us. And I know that is
one of the missions of STRATCOM and very much appreciate if we
could get an update there.
Admiral Haney. Absolutely, Congressman Bridenstine.
[The information referred to can be found in the Appendix
on page 75.]
Mr. Bridenstine. Thank you, Admiral.
Mr. Rogers. Thank the gentleman.
The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Montana, Mr.
Zinke, for 5 minutes.
Mr. Zinke. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the
opportunity to be with your committee today.
Admiral, my background is as Navy SEALs [Sea, Air, Land
teams]. And I have spent a lot of time looking at security, and
recently I went out to Malmstrom Air Force Base. And I am
concerned about the UH, the helos, particularly the Vietnam-era
Hueys. From talking to folks on the ground looking at it, and I
concur, these are aging helicopters, as well as they don't have
the lift and capacity. And if they do get an alert situation,
they just don't have the hover time and the distances in
Montana and I assume Minot. And I understand that you did go
out to exercise Mighty Guardian recently. Do you share my same
concerns about the Hueys?
Admiral Haney. Congressman, absolutely, in terms of
thinking very crisply associated with what we need to do to
improve security of our missile fields, and part of that effort
has included looking at those UH-1s and working with the Air
Force and Joint Staff in terms of our methodology going
forward.
So I know the Air Force has a plan now by which they plan
to work to replace those helicopters, but the attributes you
listed are the attributes that concern me in terms of the
capability, not just now, but into the future.
Mr. Zinke. Well, Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into
the record a response from the Secretary of the Air Force to
Chairman Rogers. In it, reading through it, she notes until we
replace the Hueys, it is not going to be possible to meet the
alert requirement in that letter.
[The information referred to can be found in the Appendix
on page 72.]
Mr. Zinke. Are you familiar with the letter, Admiral?
Admiral Haney. I am not exactly sure which letter you are
talking about. I am understanding of the requirements
associated with what we need the security helicopters to do.
Mr. Zinke. You would concur, though, that it is a priority
to make sure we have an alert requirement and that the teams
that are operating have the right aircraft and the right
capacity and lift?
Admiral Haney. Absolutely, sir.
Mr. McKeon. Congressman, if I could interject, the deputy
secretary is very focused on this, and we have had discussions
about an interim solution until the Air Force procures the
replacement. So we don't have a solution yet, but it has gone
up to the deputy and we will meet Admiral Haney's requirement.
Mr. Zinke. I do sit on the seapower side of it, and I know
that we looked at, as the Navy moves around their helicopters,
their MH-60s, to see whether or not it would be possible to
trans-deck some of those, and it doesn't seem possible. So I
think the solution is to look at maybe perhaps the Army
contractor, find a vehicle where we can get you the right
helicopter replacement.
I came in the service in 1985. I remember the Hueys. But I
haven't flown on a Huey since the mid-1990s. I was surprised
when I went out there and saw them. They are an aging aircraft,
but they just don't have the lift. Montana has got a lot of
expanses, let alone the weather, and then just the lift
capacity. If they do get in trouble, they just don't have the
lift to get the right people out there and stay in station.
Sir.
Mr. McKeon. I was just going to say, I have ridden the ones
at F.E. Warren. They run very well. And the people who maintain
them know how to maintain them, and they have a high
operational readiness rate. But they are very old, as you say,
and there is the weight issue.
Mr. Zinke. Thank you for your service, sir.
I yield the remainder of my time.
Mr. Rogers. I thank the gentleman. His letter will be taken
into the record, without objection.
Mr. Rogers. And you know, I am glad to hear, Secretary
McKeon, that you have said that you all have taken that up,
because it is something that I have put a lot of attention on,
as has the ranking member. We are very concerned about seeing
those helicopters replaced, and I hope that you can help the
Air Force stop being so worried about being sued and start
making the right decisions and the other stuff will work itself
out.
I just wanted to go back before I close out, the topic that
I was talking about with you, Admiral Haney, before I yielded
to the ranking member for his questions, and that goes back to
this Open Skies issue. Can you discuss with us in this open
setting what exactly the Russians are overflying as far as
infrastructure and what they are getting out of those flights?
Admiral Haney. Chairman Rogers, I think that might be
better discussed in a closed hearing in terms of things. But
they follow a flight plan and they fly over the United States.
We know where they are going to go, that sort of thing, that
covers a lot of areas. It is a transparency treaty, so likewise
we work with those other 30-some nations to also likewise fly
over Russian areas.
Mr. Rogers. Well, I will ask you in the closed session
then.
What about this, can you talk about this in the open
setting: Do you know how Open Skies fits into the Russian
overall collection strategy?
Admiral Haney. Well, I don't have the Russian intelligence
guidebook available to me, but I will say that given the lack
of overhead capability that the Russians have, Open Skies gives
them a capability to be able to reconnoiter parts of our
country and other nations as part of that.
Mr. Rogers. Okay. That is all I have got.
I yield to the ranking member for any additional questions
he may have.
Mr. Cooper. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am going to wait
till the classified session.
Mr. Rogers. Okay. Then I will go to Mr. Larsen from
Washington State. I understand he has another set of questions.
Mr. Larsen. Yeah, just one question, and this is to give
some context for tomorrow. We have the full committee as
General Breedlove is coming to testify. So I wanted to hear
from both of you, you can choose which one goes first, what
would be your recommendations in response to Russia's
noncompliance with the INF Treaty, thinking specifically the
INF Treaty, but also broadly.
Mr. McKeon. Congressman Larsen, I spent a good deal of time
in December in this room with your colleagues and the
colleagues on the House Foreign Affairs Committee on this
issue, so I would refer you for an in-depth discussion there.
But in brief, what we have done is looked at Russia's
activities, not just in regard to its violations of the INF
Treaty but its other behavior in Europe and its fairly
belligerent rhetoric, and made a number of investments in the
defense of Europe and in technologies that will be utilized in
Europe against the A2/AD [anti-access/area denial] challenge
that Russia poses, including because of their development of
this noncompliant INF missile.
So we are putting a lot of thought, work into it at EUCOM
[European Command] and in the Department, and a lot of
resources to respond to what we see as a much broader Russian
challenge, not just in its behavior in INF but what they have
done in Ukraine, some of the rhetoric. And there are some other
treaties where we have compliance concerns including the Open
Skies Treaty.
If I could amend briefly the answer before, Mr. Larsen, and
we will get you a written answer. I may have misspoken. Our
understanding is the $350 billion to $450 billion estimate is
for modernization over more than a decade. But I will clarify
that for the record.
[The information referred to can be found in the Appendix
on page 75.]
Mr. Rogers. All right. With that, we will recess for 5
minutes while we move to room 2216 for the closed portion of
this hearing.
[Whereupon, at 4:28 p.m., the subcommittee proceeded in
closed session.]

RESPONSE TO QUESTION SUBMITTED BY MR. LARSEN

Mr. McKeon. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated the
total cost of U.S. nuclear forces at $348 billion over the 10-year
period of FY 2015 through FY 2024. This estimate included both
sustainment of the existing force and modernization, for both DOD and
DOE, as well as Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3). The
CBO estimate also included a $49 billion projection for cost growth.
The FY 2015 Report on the Plan for the Nuclear Weapons Stockpile,
Nuclear Weapons Delivery Systems, and Nuclear Command and Control
System Specified in Section 1043 of the National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (the ``1043 Report'') projected a total cost
of $298 billion for U.S. nuclear forces over the same period of FY 2015
through FY 2024. After accounting for the CBO's projection of cost
growth, the two estimates for 10-year total cost are approximately
equal.
While multi-decade cost estimates are of questionable utility, we
expect the total cost for DOD nuclear modernization to be in the range
of $350 billion-$450 billion over the next two decades (FY 2017 through
FY 2036), with a projected average cost of about $19 billion per year.
In addition to these modernization costs, about $12 billion of the
annual DOD budget is currently allocated to sustainment and operation
of existing nuclear forces and Nuclear Command, Control, &
Communications (NC3).   [See page 18.]

Admiral Haney. USSTRATCOM lacks the necessary operational fidelity
to definitively address these questions; however, initiatives are being
taken to eliminate these data gaps. The DOD has directed creation of
service alternatives to address fiscal, operational, and policy
challenges, and ``specific pathfinder activities'' the DOD should
undertake that could improve commercial SATCOM acquisition and
management. DOD has charged DISA and Air Force with pathfinder
development and execution. The DISA acquisition pathfinders are
intended to help DOD understand its global commercial SATCOM
requirements & utilization while analyzing alternative commercial
leases in the short-term. The Air Force pathfinders are intended to
investigate better ways to buy commercial SATCOM in the long term.
Currently, Air Force and DISA have 5 pathfinder projects each in
various stages of development and execution. DISA pathfinder
initiatives will not be completed in FYI 7. The Pathfinders are being
institutionalized into a business process that will be executed in an
iterative fashion and will support preparation of the annual wideband
SATCOM Plan. Air Force Pathfinder 1 is complete with the four remaining
expected to be incrementally completed through 2019. Furthermore, the
Joint Staff has approved a Commercial SATCOM Centralized Management
(CSCOM) Concept of Operations (CONOPS) leveraging the pathfinders to
investigate more efficient means of operationally managing an
enterprise pool of COMSATCOM bandwidth for the DOD, particularly in the
more competitive or contested environments.   [See page 15.]
Admiral Haney. Yes, globally. a. The Defense Planning Guidance
(DPG) study ``Restoring SATCOM in a Degraded Environment'' concluded,
successful Operations Plan (OPLAN) execution is at risk due to
insufficient SATCOM capacity and is compounded in a degraded
environment. b. Current day to day lower priority missions* (i.e.
training, exercise, VIP support, RDT&E and Miscellaneous) go
unfulfilled due to lack of funds and/or capacity and coverage
shortfalls in various geographic regions. Most priority missions are
successfully executed; however, these missions may also be challenged
due to user saturation or on-orbit availability in South West Asia
(SWA), Africa, and portions of the Pacific.   [See page 15.]

QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MEMBERS POST HEARING

February 24, 2016

=======================================================================

QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MR. ROGERS

Mr. Rogers. Why is it important that NATO declare operational
capability of the European Phased Adaptive Approach this summer when
the Alliance gathers for the Warsaw Summit?
Mr. McKeon. EPAA Phase II provides NATO (Ballistic Missile Defense)
(BMD) with a roughly tenfold increase in capability since NATO declared
Interim BMD Capability at the Chicago Summit. This tenfold increase
comes from Aegis Ashore in Romania; four Aegis BMD capable ships
homeported at Rota, Spain; a more capable interceptor; a more capable
Aegis weapons system; and an improved NATO command and control system.
A NATO declaration of BMD IOC at the Warsaw Summit sends three
important messages: first, that the United States is committed to the
defense of our deployed forces and Allies by increasing the capability
of NATO BMD; second, that Allies recognize the importance of this
contribution; and third, that NATO follows through on its security
commitments.
Mr. Rogers. When you testified in December of 2014 and in December
of 2015, you promised this subcommittee, and a sister subcommittee on
another committee, a briefing on the military options that have been
promised to respond to the Russian Federation's violations of the INF
treaty. That briefing has not yet happened. When will that briefing
occur?
Mr. McKeon. I understand that Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
is working to arrange a time of brief Chairman Rogers and Ranking
Member Cooper.
Mr. Rogers. We received a response to a question for the record you
were asked in December concerning press reporting of negotiations with
Pakistan concerning nuclear weapons. The response indicated there were
no discussions that would lead to a ``legally binding'' agreement. To
be clear, are there any discussions, including those that would lead to
an agreement that would not be legally-binding?
Mr. McKeon. I believe the question for the record to which you
refer was directed to the State Department. I defer to the State
Department to provide additional information.
Mr. Rogers. Recently, I saw a press report that the United States
floated to Russia a proposal to undertake further nuclear arms
reductions. I have to ask, is this true? Have the Russians in any way
even attempted to resolve their violation of the INF treaty? Has it
done anything to resolve compliance concerns on the Open Skies Treaty?
How about the Biological Weapons Convention? The Chemical Weapons
Convention?
Mr. McKeon. The United States has and will only consider nuclear
reductions that are in the U.S. national security interest and that of
our allies and partners. In June 2013, President Obama stated U.S.
willingness to negotiate up to a one-third reduction in deployed
strategic warheads from the level established by the New START Treaty.
Although the Administration's desire for such a negotiation remains,
progress requires a willing partner and a conducive strategic
environment, which we do not have currently.
Russia has not been forthcoming with any information related to the
existence of its Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty
noncompliant missile.
With regard to the Open Skies Treaty, the United States continues
to engage with Russia and other Treaty Parties in the Open Skies
Consultative Commission in an effort to resolve our compliance concerns
and to improve Treaty implementation. In the meantime, we have adopted
a very strict interpretation of our Treaty obligations, given Russia's
failure to address these concerns to date. We are working with allies
and partners to engage Russia on a path to full implementation. Open
Skies observation flights by the United States and other Treaty Parties
continue over Russia regularly and most of these proceed without issues
arising.
The United States still cannot confirm Russia's compliance with the
Biological Weapons Convention, as it remains unclear whether Russia has
fulfilled the obligations inherited from the Soviet Union to destroy
completely or divert to peaceful purposes items specified in Article I
of the Convention.
Similarly, the United States still cannot confirm Russia's
compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention, as it is unclear if
Russia has met its obligations for declaration of its chemical weapon
stockpiles, production facilities, and development facilities.
Mr. Rogers. Why has the President consistently supported the ICBM
leg of the triad? Why does it continue to be relevant?
Mr. McKeon. The Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) force
provides the President with an important and unique contribution to our
overall deterrent capabilities. ICBMs provide our most rapid response
capability, and current U.S. nuclear posture preserves that
responsiveness and strengthens strategic stability by maintaining most
ICBMs on alert. The ICBM force also ensures that no adversary could
launch a comprehensive counterforce attack on the United States by
striking only a few targets. Finally, ICBM upload capability provides
the ability to hedge against geopolitical surprise and technical
problems in other parts of the arsenal. These attributes continue to
contribute significantly to maintaining strategic stability.
Mr. Rogers. As a policy matter, what should an adversary know if it
thinks about attacking our MW and NC3 satellites? Is that adversary
crossing a redline by taking our our protected comms and eyes that are
designed to maintain situational awareness during a nuclear war? These
capabilities are special, right?
Mr. McKeon. Adversaries should understand that any attack against
the United States, including attacks on critical U.S. military systems,
would result in a U.S. response that would impose costs that far
outweigh the benefits they hope to achieve. Attempts to degrade our
ability to detect or respond to nuclear attack would be particularly
dangerous for them and not worth the associated risk.
Mr. Rogers. Should any decisions be made by the services or
components that would deprive the President of decision time when it
comes to nuclear attacks and nuclear responses?
Mr. McKeon. In general, the Department of Defense (DOD) supports
maximizing the President's decision time in crises, and providing the
President with as much information as possible to inform his decisions.
DOD continues to take steps to ensure that our Nuclear Command,
Control, and Communications capabilities meet national requirements,
and the Military Departments play a vital role in that process.
Mr. Rogers. Is nuclear deterrence the highest priority of the
Department of Defense? Does the Obama Administration believe 7% of our
defense budget for a decade or so is a price worth paying for
modernizing our nuclear deterrent? If top-line budget relief is not
provided, does the administration believe it should: (1) make cuts
within the nuclear portfolio; (2) make cuts in the conventional
portfolio to keep the nuclear portfolio whole?
Mr. McKeon. Nuclear deterrence is the highest priority of the
Department and we are committed to ensuring a safe, secure, and
effective arsenal. This requires adequate and consistent funding of
modernization programs that cannot be delayed further without putting
the safety, security, and effectiveness of our nuclear forces at
significant and unacceptable risk.
Although multi-decade cost estimates are of questionable utility,
we expect the total cost of modernization to be in the $350 billion to
$450 billion range. Peak projected funding occurs in the 2026-2035
timeframe, with a maximum of $26 billion in Fiscal Year (FY) 2030. The
projected average cost is $19 billion per year from FY 2017 through FY
2036. The peak fraction of the defense budget will depend on the size
of the overall budget at that time, and is currently not known. We can
say, however, that $19 billion to $26 billion corresponds to 3.3-4.5
percent of the President's FY 2017 budget request. In addition to
modernization costs, sustainment and operation of existing nuclear
forces and Nuclear Command, Control, & Communications currently
accounts for about two percent of the DOD budget.
The Administration's nuclear sustainment and modernization plan is
necessary, and it is affordable, if prioritized appropriately by the
Department of Defense, Congress, and the Nation.
Mr. Rogers. Please explain to us why the Administration is pursing
the new air launched cruise missile, the LRSO? Is the Administration's
commitment to this capability iron-clad? Does the Administration
believe LRSO is destabilizing?
Mr. McKeon. The Administration's decision to develop a Long-Range
Standoff (LRSO) cruise missile to replace the aging Air-Launched Cruise
Missile (ALCM) is essential to maintain the ALCM's unique contribution
to stable and effective deterrence. The current system is already
decades beyond its planned service life, and its viability will be
challenged over the next decade by advanced air defenses.
Cruise missiles provide capabilities that complement rather than
duplicate that of a stealth bomber. Standoff capability extends the
effective range of our bomber fleet and complicates the air defense
problem facing any country seeking to negate the air component of our
deterrent. As air defense capabilities continue to improve and
proliferate, we cannot assume our technological lead will forever
ensure unchallenged U.S. bomber operations over any target in any
theater.
The ALCM provides an important contribution to the range of
credible options available to the President for responding to nuclear
attack. And because aircraft can be visibly deployed and flown during a
crisis, they provide a forceful reminder to an adversary contemplating
aggression that the risk it faces is real. The ability to respond
proportionately to a limited nuclear attack strengthens our ability to
deter such attacks from ever taking place. This is critical in a world
where we must not only avoid unintended escalation, but also deter
deliberate nuclear escalation like that envisioned in Russia's current
strategy.
The LRSO will contribute to strategic stability by retaining a
response option that does not pose the threat of a disarming surprise
attack against Russia or China. The process of alerting strategic
bombers is observable, and the aircraft and the missile must spend
hours flying towards their targets. Thus, ALCMs provide more potential
for warning than do either ballistic missiles or ground- and sea-
launched cruise missiles forward-deployed in theater or aboard ships on
station.
Mr. Rogers. What is the goal of U.S. nuclear forces? Do we merely
wish to ``deter'' nuclear weapons use against the U.S. and its allies?
Do we also plan to ``defeat'' a nuclear-armed adversary if deterrence
fails?
Admiral Haney. U.S. nuclear forces contribute to our national
security interests in peacetime, crisis, and conflict by deterring
potential adversaries and assuring allies around the world. They are an
indispensable component in preserving strategic stability.
The President's 2010 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) states that the
fundamental role of U.S. nuclear weapons, which will continue as long
as nuclear weapons exists, is to deter nuclear attack on the U.S., our
allies, and partners--recognizing that there remains a narrow range of
contingencies in which U.S. nuclear weapons may still play a role in
deterring a conventional or chemical-biological weapon attack against
the U.S. or its allies and partners. The NPR also lists five key
objectives that frame U.S. nuclear weapons policies and postures.
Specifically, preventing nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism;
reducing the role of U.S. nuclear weapons in U.S. national security
strategy; maintaining strategic deterrence and stability at reduced
nuclear force levels; strengthening regional deterrence and reassuring
U.S. allies and partners; and sustaining a safe, secure, and effective
nuclear arsenal. While the NPR provides the framework and guiding
principles of U.S. nuclear forces, there is prudence in further
articulating the role of these capabilities.
The 2013 Report on the Nuclear Employment Strategy of the United
States notes another key objective of U.S. nuclear weapons policies and
posture, namely, to contribute to the President's options for achieving
U.S. and allied objectives if deterrence fails.
As stated in 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review, our nuclear forces
contribute to deterring aggression against U.S. and allied interest in
multiple regions, assuring U.S. allies that our extended deterrence
guarantees are credible, and demonstrating that we can defeat or
counter aggression if deterrence fails. This includes the security and
vital interests of our allies and partners in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, Asia, and the Pacific. U.S nuclear forces also help
convince potential adversaries that they cannot successfully escalate
their way out of failed conventional aggression against the United
States or our allies and partners.
Further, our extended deterrent reduces the likelihood of nuclear
proliferation. Beyond the implications this has for the Nuclear Non-
proliferation Treaty, the ability of the U.S. to dissuade acquisition
by others minimizes strategic risk. More to the point, the nuclear and
conventional dialogue as well as cooperation we enjoy with our allies
present a more cohesive and ardent challenge to potential adversaries.
Invariably, the U.S. extended deterrence policy guarantees the safety
and security of our allies under the any scenario when their very
existence and way of life may be threatened.
Ultimately, deterrence is about conducting integrated and combined
operations and activities. It requires a comprehensive understanding of
the strategic environment from an adversary's point of view. It's about
communicating capability and intent. Whether we are deterring
aggression in space, cyberspace, or nuclear--our actions and
capabilities must convince any adversary that they cannot escalate
their way out of a failed conflict--and that restraint is always the
better option. Our adversaries must appreciate that the U.S. is not
limited to a single domain or axis and that we are capable of
responding in a time, place and domain of our choosing.
Mr. Rogers. Why has the President consistently supported the ICBM
leg of the triad? Why does it continue to be relevant? Why is keeping
the Milestone A decision on schedule important to you? What are your
views on ``commonality'' in the development of the Minuteman III
replacement, the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD)?
Admiral Haney. The Administration's nuclear posture and defense
reviews affirmed previous findings that a nuclear Triad delivers the
best mix of unique and complimentary capabilities to accomplish our
national strategy and policy objectives of deterring adversaries and
assuring allies. The Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) force
continues to provide the most responsive capability that maximizes
decision space. ICBMs also provide a highly reliable and cost effective
deterrent capability as part of a credible Triad. Any attempt to defeat
the geographically dispersed ICBM force would require an adversary to
execute a complex strategic attack. This `high cost to attack'
reinforces stability by reducing the incentive for an adversary to
execute such a strategy.
Maintaining the development and deployment schedule for Ground-
Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) is essential; it is a `just-in-time'
program to replace the aged Minuteman III ICBM force. Any program delay
would risk introducing strategic capability gaps if GBSD is not
deployed in sufficient time to gain confidence in the weapon system
prior to Minuteman III retirement.
Commonality between Air Force and Navy ballistic missile programs
may offer benefits in terms of decreased development and procurement
costs and reduced schedule risk as we modernize both forces. Technical
risk associated with common components and subsystems can be
effectively managed through wise procurement strategies and robust
testing and surveillance programs.
Mr. Rogers. Should any decisions be made by the services or
components that would deprive the President of decision time when it
comes to nuclear attacks and nuclear responses?
Admiral Haney. To maximize Presidential decision space, the United
States must sustain and modernize its nuclear deterrence capability.
This involves more than just the platforms that make up the nuclear
TRIAD, it also requires an appropriate intelligence and sensing
apparatus to provide indication and warning of incoming threats;
assured National and Nuclear Command, Control and Communications; a
credible missile defense system that defends against limited attacks;
and a resilient space and cyberspace architecture.
The President's budget for 2017 supports this needed sustainment
and modernization. USSTRATCOM continues to work closely with the
Services and Office of the Secretary of Defense leadership to ensure
the effectiveness of our strategic deterrent capabilities to facilitate
current and future strategic capability and maximize Presidential
decision space.
Mr. Rogers. Should we view the ITWAA and NC3 capabilities as legs
of the TRIAD? Have we been paying enough attention to ITWAA and its
enablers? Are you comfortable with the plan to evolve these
capabilities--and that we'll all stick with it--to ensure a survivable
capability?
Admiral Haney. Our nuclear deterrent is foundational to America's
defense; it is a synthesis of dedicated sensors, assured command and
control, a triad of delivery systems, nuclear weapons, enabling
infrastructure, trained and ready people, and treaties and
nonproliferation activities. All remain essential to our national
security and continue to provide a stabilizing force in the global
geopolitical fabric of the world. Each provides unique and
complementary attributes that together underpin strategic deterrence
and stability.
Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) and
Nuclear Command, Control and Communications (NC3) are critical aspects
of our comprehensive efforts to achieve deterrence and assurance. Our
ITW/AA capabilities provide indications and assessments supporting
escalation control options and attack attribution. NC3 assets support
our national-decision making process across a spectrum of scenarios,
and provide the President and his key advisors the right information to
expand decision space.
ITW/AA and NC3 capabilities must be survivable and endurable. They
provide the `connective tissue' of a credible and effective Triad and
facilitate comprehensive deterrence, assurance, and escalation control.
I am encouraged by the Defense Department's renewed focus on ITW/AA and
eagerly anticipate tangible NC3 capability modernization results.
The FY17 President's Budget adequately addresses our ITW/AA and NC3
needs. However, while we have made significant investment gains in
these capabilities, we must remain vigilant to safeguard funding
identified for recapitalization efforts to ensure capabilities
effectively address emerging threats across the conflict spectrum and
meet mission requirements, from the President to the warfighter.
Mr. Rogers. What is the military requirement for extended
deterrence in Europe? Why is the life extension of the B61 gravity bomb
important to Europe's security?
Admiral Haney. The three legs of the U.S. Nuclear Triad, nuclear
command, control, and communications system (NC3), supporting
infrastructure, space and early warning sensors, cyberspace, and
ballistic missile defenses are critical components of our strategic
deterrent forces that provide unique and complimentary capabilities
that deter our adversaries and assure allies and partners. As such, the
U.S. remains committed to supporting an appropriate mix of
conventional, nuclear and missile defense capabilities to meet NATO
deterrence and extended deterrence objectives in Europe. Legacy B61-3/4
weapons are the only U.S. nuclear weapons deployed OCONUS to meet the
nuclear portion of our NATO commitment. This is increasingly important
to security in Europe as Russia continues to modernize its nuclear
forces and make overt threats to NATO countries. These weapons are well
beyond their intended service life, and the B61-12 Life Extension
Program (LEP) will replace them with a single, modern variant to
sustain our commitment to NATO. In addition to meeting NATO commitments
the B61-12 is being designed to meet USSTRATCOM requirements and
extended deterrent/assurance commitments to allies worldwide including
the Asia-Pacific region.
In the next decade, B61-12 will be the sole nuclear gravity bomb in
the U.S. stockpile. Gravity weapons offer the most diverse and flexible
options to meet both OPLAN requirements and regional scenarios. The
B61-12 LEP is an essential element of our stockpile sustainment and
modernization strategy and supports our nuclear non-proliferation
goals, by ensuring continued support to allies and negating their need
to develop their own nuclear programs. Ultimately, the B61-12 will be
fielded on legacy (B-2) and future bombers (B-21--Long Range Strike-
Bomber) and dual capable aircraft (DCA). This program demonstrates a
strong U.S. commitment to modernize and deploy a capable deterrent/
assurance force while directly supporting U.S. non-proliferation goals.
Mr. Rogers. What is the way ahead for the JSPOC (Joint Space
Operations Center) and the JICSPOC (Joint Interagency Combined Space
Operations Center)? Does it make sense to be maintain two facilities?
Admiral Haney. The Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) at
Vandenberg Air Force Base (AFB), is charged with conducting day-to-day
operations, to include supporting coalition forces in theater. The
Joint Interagency Combined Space Operations Center (JICSpOC) at
Schriever AFB will provide an operational experimentation and test
environment to develop the tools, relationships, processes and
procedures that will be effective in a contested space environment. We
are in the process of reviewing the JICSpOC concept while also working
to improve JSpOC functionality in the areas of Space Situational
Awareness for both commercial and Allied nation systems, and global
theater support.
Mr. Rogers. As you know, the Air Force is completing its analyses
of alternatives for the OPIR and AEHF systems. What are the risks of
``disaggregation'' of these capabilities?
Admiral Haney. Space capabilities are a vital component of
comprehensive deterrence and assurance and are critical to supporting
our deployed forces and our national decision-making processes.
However, space has become an increasingly contested, degraded, and
operationally limited domain. As the threat to our space capabilities
continues to rise, so too must the resiliency of our space assets.
Disaggregation is an effort to improve our resiliency in space, and
is one of several factors being considered in the development of future
Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) and protected Satellite
Communications (SATCOM) architectures. The Defense Department continues
to assess the benefits and risks associated with different
architectures. USSTRATCOM, among other stakeholder organizations, is
engaged with Air Force Space Command to carefully examine cost,
schedule, performance, protection, resilience, and user segment
synchronization and transition risk to inform future investment and
strategy decisions. We are confident the potential risks and benefits
of disaggregation will be fully explored and accounted for in this
process.
Mr. Rogers. What is your professional military opinion as to why
the United States needs LRSO? Can we use JASSM-ER for a nuclear stand-
off capability and simply cancel LRSO? Why or why not?
Admiral Haney. The U.S. needs the Long Range Stand-off (LRSO)
cruise missile's range and ability to penetrate air defenses to provide
the necessary global target coverage that denies adversaries any
geographic sanctuary for high value targets. Maintaining a credible
stand-off capability is an essential element of both effective
strategic deterrence and extended deterrence to NATO and our Asia-
Pacific allies. Sustaining this stand-off capability is especially
important as adversaries continue to seek anti-access/area denial
(A2AD) advantages that limit U.S. operational effectiveness.
Cancelling the LRSO and using the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff
Missile, Extended Range (JASSM-ER) for a nuclear stand-off capability
will not work. JASSM-ER's range is not sufficient to hold adversary
targets at risk, and JASSM-ER was never designed to accommodate a
nuclear warhead. Re-designing JASSM-ER to increase its range and
certify it for nuclear use would require resources and time in excess
of those projected for the current LRSO program.
The LRSO cruise missile is needed to replace the aging Air Launched
Cruise Missile (ALCM), whose viability will be challenged by advanced
air and missile defenses. ALCM is decades past its planned service
life, and facing reliability challenges. The LRSO is needed to support
the bomber force well into the future.
Mr. Rogers. What is your professional military opinion as to why
the United States needs GBSD? If we simply life extended Minuteman III,
would it be capable of meeting your nuclear deterrence requirements?
Why or why not?
Admiral Haney. Our nuclear Triad consists of Intercontinental
Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs), Ballistic Missile Submarines, Air-Launched
Cruise Missiles, and nuclear capable heavy bombers and associated
tankers. Each leg of the Triad provides unique and complementary
attributes that together underpin strategic deterrence and stability.
The Triad provides a hedge against technical problems or changes in the
security environment and must consist of independently viable weapons
systems and platforms which present adversaries with a complex, multi-
pronged problem.
Our ICBM force provides a responsive, highly reliable and cost
effective deterrent capability. The Ground Based Strategic Deterrent
(GBSD) is an essential investment to ensure the U.S. maintains an
effective land-based strategic ballistic missile capability as part of
a credible nuclear Triad. While we have successfully extended Minuteman
III several times, continued life extensions will not maintain weapon
system effectiveness. This option was assessed as more costly than
developing and fielding GBSD. The U.S. will encounter a strategic
capability gap if GBSD is not fielded prior to the age-out and
retirement of the Minuteman III ICBM.
Mr. Rogers. What is the minimum number of Ohio-class replacement
submarines that are required to fulfill STRATCOM's requirements for
sea-based deterrence? Please be specific and explain why having only 10
replacement submarines is insufficient.
Admiral Haney. Our nuclear Triad consists of Intercontinental
Ballistic Missiles, Ballistic Missile Submarines, Air-Launched Cruise
Missiles, and nuclear capable heavy bombers and associated tankers.
Each leg of the Triad provides unique and complementary attributes that
together underpin strategic deterrence and stability. The Triad
provides a hedge against technical problems or changes in the security
environment and must consist of independently viable weapons systems
and platforms which present adversaries with a complex, multi-pronged
problem.
The Ohio-class SSBN fleet is undergoing significant sustainment
efforts to maintain our nation's required high operational availability
and extend the life of the D5 ballistic missile. Twelve Ohio-class
Replacement Program (ORP) submarines is the minimum number required to
meet USSTRATCOM's sea-based deterrent requirements. The program of
record determined this number through detailed analysis of operational
requirements, patrol and maintenance cycles, and current/postulated
threats. Fielding fewer than 12 ORP submarines would introduce
unacceptable strategic capability risk in our most survivable leg of
the Triad.

QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MR. COOPER
Mr. Cooper. How do we ensure that we effectively deter Russia and
other adversaries without increasing risks of undermining strategic
stability, increase the risks of miscalculation or causing a nuclear
arms race?
Mr. McKeon. We seek to maintain a nuclear deterrent that is robust
and stable, rather than one that is necessarily reactive to every
action of potential adversaries. This remains best served by sustaining
the nuclear Triad and Dual-Capable Aircraft (DCA) with a diverse range
of nuclear explosive yields and delivery modes. The Triad and DCA
provide the flexibility, responsiveness, and survivability we need to
meet and adapt to the challenges of a dynamic 21st century security
environment, including those posed by Russia, without the need to
mirror every potential adversary, system-for-system and yield-for-
yield. Thus, the Administration's plan focuses on sustaining and
modernizing current platforms, delivery systems, and warheads to
preserve existing military capabilities in the face of evolving
threats, rather than developing new nuclear warheads with new military
capabilities. In addition to positioning us to address deterrence
threats as they emerge, this approach bolsters strategic stability by
decreasing incentives for a future arms race without seeking the
ability to negate Russia's strategic deterrent capabilities.
Mr. Cooper. What is DOD's plan to stop reliance on the RD-180
engine and ensure reliable access to space within the next few years?
Admiral Haney. Space capabilities are a vital component of
comprehensive deterrence and assurance and are critical to supporting
our deployed forces and our national decision-making processes.
However, space has become an increasingly contested, degraded, and
operationally limited domain. As the threat to our space capabilities
continues to rise, so too must the resiliency of our space assets.
Improved launch capabilities will help assure the resiliency of our
space-based capabilities.
USSTRATCOM requires effects from the space domain to execute its
assigned responsibilities. Critical Space capabilities include
communications; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR);
missile warning; and Positioning Navigation Timing. We rely heavily
upon Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) to deploy these critical systems
and are closely coordinating with AFSPC to study options to field
reliable and robust domestic launch capabilities.
Mr. Cooper. How do we ensure that we effectively deter Russia and
other adversaries without increasing risks of undermining strategic
stability, increase the risks of miscalculation or causing a nuclear
arms race?
Admiral Haney. Ensuring a robust deterrent without undermining
stability, increasing the risk of miscalculation or causing an arms
race was, during the Cold War, a continuously monitored and
aggressively studied balancing problem. Post-Cold War, less attention
was placed on this problem. Today, we must again more diligently
monitor and assess strategic stability.
The basic tenets of strategic stability remain the same. First,
stable strategic deterrence is underpinned by force structure and
posture that ensure neither the United States nor or Russia could gain
significant advantage by attempting a disarming first strike on the
other's nuclear forces.
Arms control treaties are a second key aspect of managing strategic
stability. They provide increased transparency into each nation's
activities and provide an upper limit on capabilities. The transparency
provided by the New START Treaty has (to date) been adhered to
regarding strategic nuclear weapons between the United States and
Russia.
Third, interactions with Russia across all elements of the U.S.
government are key to ensuring actions taken by both sides do not
inadvertently trigger destabilizing activities. While these discussions
and exchanges are not a panacea, they are a key component to avoiding
misperceptions.
Fourth, we must have a comprehensive understanding and perception
of the strategic environment from an adversary's point of view. This
requires a robust foundational intelligence capability.
Fifth, we must work diligently to ensure our whole of government
activities are internally consistent with our objectives. Words and
actions must be unambiguously coherent regarding the National Security
Interests of the United States. This is much easier said than done.
Thus, there is a need for increased diligence across the U.S.
government in this regard.
Finally, we must continue to pursue the modernization of the force
in a manner that is consistent with replacing and maintaining the
necessary capability, while avoiding the perception of increasing the
scale or scope of these capabilities. This must be appropriately
balanced given the modernization and development of nuclear weapon
capabilities by other nation states that in some cases are expanding
their capabilities. Again, increased diligence is necessary to ensure
strategic stability is preserved. We must continue to provide a safe,
secure, effective and ready nuclear deterrent as a top priority that
includes:

An appropriate intelligence and sensing apparatus to give
indications and warnings of incoming threats

Assured National and Nuclear Command, Control and
Communications

A visible TRIAD of platforms including Intercontinental
Ballistic Missiles, Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles, and Bombers
with associated systems that includes an Air Launched Cruise Missile.
Refueling tankers are also needed to support the Bomber leg of the
TRIAD

A credible Missile Defense system that defends against
limited attacks

A resilient Space and Cyberspace architecture

A robust conventional force.

QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MR. TAKAI
Mr. Takai. How has STRATCOM/JFCC Space reoriented operations to
support PACOM?
Mr. McKeon. The Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) provides
space-based capabilities in support of U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM)
operations. These capabilities include day-to-day missile warning;
satellite communications; positioning, navigation, and timing; and
nuclear detonation detection capabilities. JSpOC also provides
Offensive Space Control (OSC) effects, which influence USPACOM planning
for future contingencies.
The Joint Functional Component Command Space (JFCC Space) supports
USPACOM through its Non-Kinetic Duty Officer (NKDO). The NKDO offers
options for space protection capabilities in the event of an emergent
counter-space event in USPACOM's Area of Responsibility. This
connection, which is essential to a strong relationship with USPACOM,
supports theater operations and protects existing space capabilities.
Mr. Takai. Admiral Haney--What is your assessment of the risk to
space services that are so vital to our Joint Force? Is risk
increasing? How is Strategic Command evolving from operating in space
in a peaceful environment, to one which is contested by potential
adversaries?
Admiral Haney. Space is no longer a sanctuary from conflict, and
our space forces must be able to contend with both natural and man-made
hazards. The risks increase as other nations field and improve
capabilities designed to counter the U.S. space advantage.
Recognizing that most organizations share the same risks of
operating in the space domain, we are working to meet the challenges
through improved partnerships with international and commercial
agencies and throughout our Intelligence Community. We are also making
meaningful space investments to defend ourselves and assure space
operations throughout all levels of conflict.
We are investing in efforts to improve stability, resiliency, and
assurance of our space operations. This includes updated Battlefield
Management Command and Control (BMC2) systems, integration of
Department of Defense and Intelligence Community space capabilities and
operations, and building up responsive measures to defend space-enabled
capabilities.
Existing and expanding potential adversary capabilities are
included in our exercises and learning processes.
We have a deliberate approach as Commander, United States Strategic
Command, participates in DOD Defense Space Councils and Deputy's
Management Action Groups, and also is a co-chair with Ms. Betty Sapp,
Director National Reconnaissance Office, of the Joint Space Doctrine
and Tactics Forum (JSDTF). The JSDTF's goals are to ensure U.S. space
policy, doctrine, operational concepts, strategies and planning
scenarios reflect that space is a contested domain, populated by
dynamic actors. Through the JSDTF, we have already made significant
improvements in the integration of exercises and wargames, and are
revising associated joint doctrine, as well as new tactics, techniques
and procedures for our space operators. The JSDTF will foster the
transformation of how the U.S. operates in space by promoting seamless
functionality between the DOD and Intelligence Community.
Another key initiative is the establishment of the Joint
Interagency Combined Space Operations Center (JICSpOC) located at
Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado. This center combines the efforts
of USSTRATCOM, Air Force Space Command, and the Intelligence Community
with a goal to create unity of effort and facilitate information
sharing across the national security space enterprise. The JICSpOC will
ensure the space enterprise meets and outpaces emerging and advanced
space threats and will provide vital information for national
leadership, allies, partners and the Joint Force. It will also serve to
enhance the Nation's deterrent posture by demonstrating the United
States is prepared when our space capabilities are threatened.
Mr. Takai. Admiral Haney--As you know, the current U.S. Space
Surveillance Network optical sensors can only operate at night. 24/7
monitoring is essential to monitor and defend vital space-based assets.
I'm aware of certain proven prototype optical systems capable of
daytime and night operations. What are your plans to make that an
operational capability?
Admiral Haney. Space capabilities are a vital component of
comprehensive deterrence and assurance and are critical to supporting
our deployed forces and our national decision-making processes.
However, space has become an increasingly contested, degraded, and
operationally limited domain. Our ability to monitor the space
environment is increasingly vital given recent advancements in
adversary counter-space capabilities. The proof-of-concept work on
daylight optical systems is encouraging and points to a potential role
for these sensors as a part of our Space Surveillance Network (SSN). We
continue to investigate the utility, limitations and cost benefit of
this technology to improve our space surveillance capability within
resource constraints.
Mr. Takai. How has STRATCOM/JFCC Space reoriented operations to
support PACOM?
Admiral Haney. Space capabilities are a vital component of
comprehensive deterrence and assurance and are critical to supporting
our deployed forces and our national decision-making processes. Our
national space capabilities allow us to globally navigate, communicate,
and observe events in areas where non-space sensors are not feasible.
USSTRATCOM Joint Functional Component Command Space (JFCC SPACE),
through the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC), provides space-based
capabilities in support of United States Pacific Command (PACOM)
operations in the following ways:

Day-to-day environmental monitoring

Satellite Communications (SATCOM)

Positioning, Navigation and Timing capabilities

Theater Missile Warning Battlespace Awareness

and Combat Search and Rescue support
In addition to meeting Department of Defense mission sets, JFCC
SPACE provides oversight of the commercial SATCOM systems utilized in
PACOM through the Commercial Integration Cell. JFCC SPACE supports
allied countries and commercial entities in PACOM through Space
Situational Sharing Agreements with USSTRATCOM. These countries include
Japan, the Republic of Korea and Australia. Our Pacific Allies rely on
JFCC SPACE to provide navigation accuracy through GPS constellation
management. USSTRATCOM's Purposeful Interference Response Team,

Mr. Garamendi. How is the DOD addressing concerns that the Long-
Range Stand-Off weapon may be destabilizing?
Mr. McKeon. We appreciate the opportunities that congressional
hearings provide to reiterate publicly the important role of the Long-
Range Standoff (LRSO) cruise missile in a nuclear modernization program
designed to maintain strategic stability with Russia and China. The
LRSO will sustain the deterrent capabilities currently provided by the
Air-Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM), which has contributed to strategic
stability for decades by providing a response option that does not pose
the threat of a disarming surprise attack to Russia or China. The
process of alerting strategic bombers is observable, and the aircraft
and the missile must spend hours flying towards their targets. Thus,
ALCMs provide more potential for warning than do either ballistic
missiles or ground- and sea-launched cruise missiles forward-deployed
in theater or aboard ships on station.
The LRSO will help maintain strategic stability at the lowest
possible number of nuclear weapons consistent with sustaining options
for effective deterrence, and without developing new nuclear warheads.
Mr. Garamendi. Can you share with the committee the planning
(including the estimated development and production timelines and
decision points) and cost estimates for nuclear modernization,
including for nuclear modernization beyond 2025? When does the funding
bow-wave occur?
The Department of Defense, in cooperation with the National Nuclear
Security Agency (NNSA), developed a long-term nuclear modernization and
recapitalization plan that maintains a credible strategic deterrent
force. The plan delivers required modern and reliable strategic and
extended deterrence capabilities as legacy systems retire.
Specifics of the plan, including cost estimates and schedule, are
reported in the Defense Department's `Annual Report on the Plan for the
Nuclear Weapons Stockpile, Nuclear Weapons Complex, Nuclear Weapons
Delivery Systems, and Nuclear Weapons Command and Control System'.
The nuclear modernization bow-wave starts in or about 2021 and will
peak in the mid to late 2020s. Spending on the nuclear enterprise is
predicted to rise to 5-6% of U.S. defense spending as specified in the
Congressional Budget Office's ``Projected Costs of U.S. Nuclear Forces,
2015 to 2024'' report. This level of investment is appropriate given
the contribution of U.S. nuclear deterrence capabilities to our
National security and global stability. If we assume historical
averages, funding for the nuclear enterprise should return to 3-4% of
the defense budget following this period of critical modernization.
Mr. Garamendi. A recent article in the Daily Beast noted a STRATCOM
requirement that the new ICBM must be more accurate. Please explain
what the added accuracy and capability requirements are for the GBSD.
Is the Air Force looking at using technology that the Navy has already
developed?
Admiral Haney. Our nuclear Triad consists of Intercontinental
Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs), Ballistic Missile Submarines, Air-Launched
Cruise Missiles, and nuclear capable heavy bombers and associated
tankers. Each Triad leg provides unique and complementary attributes
that together underpin strategic deterrence and stability. The Triad
provides a hedge against technical problems or changes in the security
environment and must consist of independently viable weapons systems
and platforms which present adversaries with a complex, multi-pronged
strategic problem. Our ICBM force provides the most responsive
capability that maximizes Presidential decision time. The ICBM force
also provides a highly reliable and cost effective deterrent capability
as part of a credible Triad.
USSTRATCOM fully supports the Air Force plan to develop and deploy
a Minuteman III replacement, called the Ground-Based Strategic
Deterrent (GBSD), which maintains strategic effectiveness beyond 2030.
One component of maintaining ICBM effectiveness is ensuring the
missile's accuracy across its full operational range. This can be
affordably accomplished at low technical risk by utilizing existing,
mature ballistic missile guidance components which improve performance
over 1970s-era Minuteman technology.
The GBSD program is exploring commonality opportunities at the
system and subsystem levels to minimize non-recurring engineering cost,
reduce lifecycle cost, and gain production efficiencies. Regarding
accuracy, the Air Force and industry partners are currently examining
existing U.S. Navy Trident II D5 ballistic missile guidance systems to
leverage for the GBSD missile.
Mr. Garamendi. What contracts does STRATCOM have with universities
or think tanks to support nuclear deterrence thinking and policy? What
entities are these contracts with and what are the value of these
contracts?
Admiral Haney. USSTRATCOM's University Affiliated Research Center
(UARC) for Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) is a 5-year
contract in partnership with the University of Nebraska. The purpose of
a UARC is to focus a high-level, world-class research university on a
specific, enduring, technically hard problem to create a continuity of
research, focus and generate unconventional thoughts to solve critical
problems, and help train the next generation of strategic thinkers.
There are five task orders directly sponsored by USSTRATCOM/J5
supporting nuclear deterrence thinking and policy and their assigned
value is $500K: Behavioral Influence ($146K), Deterrence Strategic
Stage Set ($115K), Risk of Extended Deterrence ($73K), Development/
Assessment of Narrative Counter-Narrative ($95K) and Horizontal and
Vertical Nuclear Proliferation ($71K).
Additionally, USSTRATCOM has formed a Deterrence and Assurance
Academic Alliance. The Alliance is not a contracted entity but is a
collaborative partnership with 22 regional and national universities.
We have four objectives for the Alliance: develop the next generation
of deterrence professionals, regularize our relationships with
Academia, open a continuous and robust communication with Academia, and
stimulate new thinking in deterrence and assurance studies. The
Alliance is moving into its second year and continues to grow. We
currently have eight student teams and advisors at local universities
and three National Defense University STRATCOM Scholars conducting
research on deterrence and assurance issues.
Mr. Garamendi. Can you share with the committee the analysis that
led to the specific number of 50-80 for the requirement for annual pit
production? When does DOD require 50-80 pits per year? How many are
needed to address geopolitical uncertainty and how many are to address
technical uncertainty?
Admiral Haney. An assessment of the Nuclear Weapon Pit Production
Requirements Report to Congress1, dated January 16, 2014, confirmed the
requirement for achieving 50-80 pits per year production capacity by
2030. This requirement was developed from the following factors:
1)  U.S. policy objectives to maintain a safe, secure and effective
nuclear deterrent is contingent on the national capability to produce
plutonium pits.
2)  Pit aging studies conclude pits will not have unlimited
lifetimes. Even with pit reuse, plutonium work may be required to
assure weapon safety, security and long term reliability to preclude
the need for weapon testing.
3)  The ability to produce plutonium pits in sufficient quantity
and timeliness to address technical issues is essential to the long
term reduction of the non-deployed weapon stockpile. Future stockpile
reductions are central to U.S. non-proliferation goals.
1 P.L. 112-239; FY13 NDAA, Sec. 3147
Mr. Garamendi. How is the DOD addressing concerns that the Long-
Range Stand-Off weapon may be destabilizing?
Admiral Haney. Our nuclear Triad consists of Intercontinental
Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs), Ballistic Missile Submarines, Air-Launched
Cruise Missiles (ALCM), and nuclear capable heavy bombers and
associated tankers. Each Triad leg provides unique and complementary
attributes that together underpin strategic deterrence and stability.
The Long Range Stand-off (LRSO) cruise missile is integral to the air-
leg of the Triad and provides the U.S. flexible and tailorable options
in response to a wide range of strategic and regional crises. LRSO also
presents the adversary a complex problem to defend against.
The LRSO cruise missile is not a `new' nuclear weapon and, in the
context of strategic deterrence, is not destabilizing. LRSO represents
a modernization of an existing U.S. nuclear capability. Like the
current ALCM, LRSO provides the President a variety of tailorable
options to deter adversary nuclear use, including the ability to
counter `escalate-to-deescalate' strategies. Maintaining a credible
stand-off nuclear capability contributes to stability by assuring
allies of U.S. deterrence commitments and discouraging them from
pursuing their own nuclear capabilities.
Mr. Garamendi. What can the Long-Range Stand-Off weapon (LRSOs)
accomplish that the nuclear ballistic missile submarines and the land-
based missiles (ICBMs) cannot?
Admiral Haney. This Administration's thorough review of the nuclear
deterrent force affirmed previous findings that maintaining a credible
and effective nuclear Triad, with its unique and complimentary
deterrent attributes, represented the best approach to meeting our
national security and global stability objectives. The Long Range
Stand-off (LRSO) cruise missile is integral to the air-leg of the TRIAD
and provides the President flexible and tailorable options in response
to a wide range of strategic and regional crises.
The LRSO's range and ability to penetrate air defenses provides the
necessary global target coverage that denies adversaries any geographic
sanctuary for high value targets. Unlike ballistic missiles, forward
deployable LRSO cruise missiles are visible and clearly demonstrate
U.S. resolve and commitment to allies and partners. Additionally, LRSO
cruise missiles can be rapidly loaded and deployed in response to
technical issues or operational vulnerabilities with other TRIAD
systems.
Mr. Garamendi. In a June 2014 letter on behalf of the Nuclear
Weapons Council, Mr. Kendall noted that ``without the LRSO's advanced
stand-off capability, the bomber leg of the Triad will gradually become
a symbol if our decline rather than a bellweather of enduring American
strength.'' If the air-leg of triad will become a symbol of our decline
without the LRSO, what is the value of spending at least $10 billion on
modernizing the B61 bomb?
Admiral Haney. Long Range Stand-off (LRSO) combined with B-21 (Long
Range Strike-Bomber) ensures effectiveness in anti-access/area denial
environments and has the stand-off range to deny an adversary any
geographic sanctuary. The combination of stand-off cruise missiles and
gravity weapons offer the most diverse delivery options, providing the
President flexible and tailorable options across a wide range of
strategic and regional crises. Gravity weapons are the only U.S.
nuclear weapons permanently deployed out of the continental U.S., and
are essential to maintaining our commitment to the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO).
The B61-12 Life Extension Program (LEP) will provide a modern
gravity nuclear weapon to ensure the B-2 bomber remains a viable U.S.
nuclear platform for the foreseeable future. The B61-12 LEP will
replace the aged B61-3/4/7/10 and B83-1 bombs with a single, modern
reliable weapon resulting in  50% fewer deployed gravity weapons. This
significant reduction in the U.S. gravity nuclear weapons stockpile
directly supports non-proliferation goals while still maintaining a
robust strategic & NATO deterrent capability.
Mr. Garamendi. STRATCOM sets requirements for nuclear deterrent,
but does not have responsibility to pay for the associated costs of
modernizing these platforms. How does STRATCOM evaluate costs?
Admiral Haney. The Administration's nuclear posture and defense
reviews such as the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review, 2013 Report on Nuclear
Weapons Employment Strategy, 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review, and the
2015 National Military Strategy affirmed previous findings that a
nuclear Triad delivers the best mix of unique and complimentary
capabilities to accomplish our national strategy and policy objectives
of deterring adversaries and assuring allies. USSTRATCOM works closely
with the Services and other stakeholders to ensure the sustainment and
modernization programs necessary to support our strategic deterrence
and assurance missions are adequately resourced. These efforts are
already paying off; joint efforts on fuze modernization are projected
to save the Air Force approximately $600M. Similar efforts promise to
continue to pay dividends both in the sustainment of existing and
development of follow-on systems. USSTRATCOM also fully participates in
the joint requirements validation process, which is cost informed and
in Service requirements trade-space deliberations.
The cost to sustain a viable nuclear deterrent is not trivial, but
it is important to keep these costs in perspective. Today we spend
approximately 3% of the Defense Department's budget in support of the
nuclear enterprise. Investments in the nuclear enterprise are projected
to rise to 5-6% of defense spending in the next 10 years as specified
in the Congressional Budget Office's ``Projected Costs of U.S. Nuclear
Forces, 2015 to 2024'' report. This investment is appropriate given the
contribution of our nuclear forces to our National security and global
stability. If we assume historical averages, funding for the nuclear
enterprise should return to 3-4% of defense spending following this
period of critical modernization.
Mr. Garamendi. Will the LRSO be more accurate and re-targetable in
flight?
Admiral Haney. Yes, the Long Range Stand-off (LRSO) will be more
accurate due to advances in current missile guidance technology than
the current Air Launched Cruise Missile which utilizes 1970s
technology. There is no requirement to make LRSO re-targetable in
flight.

QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY DR. FLEMING
Dr. Fleming. Could you comment on the Weapons Storage Facility
recapitalization program, in terms of your assessment of the timeline
and the importance of the program's plan to restore the Weapons Storage
Facility at Barksdale Air Force Base to enable storage and training
with weapons at both B-52 operating locations, and could you commit to
keep me and this committee updated on this project?
Admiral Haney. Weapons storage area (WSA) modernization is
important to ensuring the Nation's nuclear deterrence capability
remains safe, secure, and effective in the decades ahead. The Air Force
has a deliberate and comprehensive plan--the Weapons Storage Facility
(WSF) Investment Strategy--that will replace existing WSAs with modern
WSFs. In the FY17 PB Future Years Defense Program, the Air Force
investment includes a WSF at Barksdale Air Force Base beginning in
FY18. USSTRATCOM working in partnership with the Air Force, will keep
the Committee informed on this project.
Dr. Fleming. Could you explain why it is important to buy a new
long-range standoff weapon (LRSO) given the capabilities available with
the Long Range Strike Bomber (LRS-B)? Also, given the importance of the
LRSO, it was interesting to see that the NNSA and the Air Force's
Fiscal Year 17 requests for this program were lower than expected--does
this request allow for this capability to be produced and deployed as
scheduled?
Admiral Haney. The B-21 Long-Range Strike Bomber and Long Range
Stand-off (LRSO) cruise missile are essential to meet our nation's
strategic deterrence and assurance requirements. Both are integral to
the Triad by providing the President flexible and tailorable options in
response to a wide range of strategic and regional crises. The B-21 and
LRSO's range and ability to penetrate air defenses provides the
necessary global target coverage that denies adversaries any geographic
sanctuary for high value targets. Maintaining a credible penetrating
and stand-off nuclear capability contributes to stability by assuring
allies of U.S. deterrence commitments and discouraging them from
pursuing their own nuclear capabilities.
Delays in FY16 contract awards reduced the amounts required in
FY17. NNSA reduced their PB17 to maintain warhead development
synchronization with the Air Force's missile program. The Air Force and
NNSA PB17 requests still allow for production and deployment as
scheduled to meet USSTRATCOM's deterrence mission requirements.
